This is simply ironic ._. 
I was ,_,  recently ,_,  at the Harvard Kennedy School ,_,  United States ,_,  for an executive course on Global Leadership and Public Policy for the 21st Century ._. 
On the first day of the programme ,_,  as dozens of Young Global Leaders mingled to get to know one another ,_,  I engaged an Indian business executive in a discussion on economic growth and poverty ._. 
India is making so much progress without any doubt ,_,  I told him ,_,  but still you have millions of poor people ._. 
He nodded in agreement ._. 
That is why inclusive growth is an imperative ,_,  he said ._. 
I quickly smuggled Nigeria into the discussion ,_,  highlighting the similarities between the two countries ._. 
A lot of Nigerians have got richer in the last 15 years ,_,  I said ,_,  but most Nigerians are still poor ._. Ironically ,_,  a few days later ,_,  the World Bank President ,_,  Dr Jim Yong Kim ,_,  classified Nigerians and Indians among the poorest in the world ._. 
He said two -_: thirds of the world's extreme poor are concentrated in just five countries :_:  India ,_,  China ,_,  Nigeria ,_,  Bangladesh ,_,  and the Democratic Republic of Congo ._. 
It is apparently a game of numbers as these countries are populous ._. 
Inevitably ,_,  the most populous countries will rate high when you look at the absolute numbers ._. 
For instance ,_,  if 50% of Nigerians are poor ,_,  with a population of 170 million ,_,  it means 85 million ._. 
But if 90% of Ghanaians are poor ,_,  with a population of 25 million ,_,  that is just 22 ._. 5 million ._. 
Nigerians would still rate poorer than Ghana ,_,  numbers -_: wise ._. 
But Nigeria ranks high both in absolute figures and percentages � and this is worrisome ._. 
We always fight over population figures in Nigeria ,_,  but I have often wondered :_:  of what use is a poor multitude I would rather have a small but prosperous population than a huge but impoverished bunch ._. 
That is a discussion for some other day ._. 
Nevertheless ,_,  I have been ransacking my brain for ages to understand the Nigerian situation ._. 
We are so rich ,_,  yet we are so poor ._. 
So much money has gone into the economy since 1999 ._. 
But can we truly claim that Nigerians are better off today And can we also truly proclaim that Nigerians are worse off The World Bank and National Office of Statistics quantify poverty using the one -_: dollar -_: a -_: day benchmark ,_,  while the United Nations Development Programme measures extreme poverty by access to the basics :_:  food ,_,  shelter ,_,  sanitation ,_,  education ,_,  healthcare and water ._. 
The number of Nigerians who do not have access to these basics is insanely high and that is why we will continue to rank among the world's poorest ._. But let us look at the issue from another direction ._. 
I want us to be practical now ._. 
Let's examine realities between 1999 and 2014 ._. 
I am using this period because it represents a landmark in our history ,_,  but we can as well talk about 2007 -_: 2014 or 2011 -_: 2014 ._. 
Here are my questions then :_:  can we say there are fewer homeowners today than they were in 1999 ,_,  2007 or 2011 Can we say we have fewer hospitals within the same period Can we say we have fewer kilometres of tarred roads today Do we have less access to water today than we had in 1999 ,_,  2007 or 2011 Are there fewer number of car owners today Do we have fewer schools today Are there fewer small and medium scale businesses today Are there fewer private sector -_: made millionaires today than before We certainly cannot � in all sincerity � answer yes to all these questions ._. 
That is where my headache starts ._. 
I go round the country and still see so many poor people ._. 
I see children walking barefooted ._. 
I see children hawking in traffic ,_,  many of them unable to go to school ._. 
Take a look at the uniforms of those who go to school and you'll mistake them for rags ._. 
The quality of instruction in public schools is always under scrutiny as candidates continue to record poor results in their examinations ._. 
I see people dying because they cannot afford basic drugs ._. 
I see people living in shanties and under the bridge ._. 
I see beggars in different sizes and classes ._. 
So many graduates are out there unable to get jobs ._. 
Some who get jobs are paid so poorly it seems better for them to stay at home unemployed ._. 
We certainly cannot deny these realities ._. What then These are my random thoughts ._. 
One ,_,  it is not as if Nigeria is worse off today than it was in 1999 � it is just that economic growth is not benefiting a vast majority of the people in a proper ,_,  economically viable chain ._. 
The billions of dollars we've earned have gone mainly into financing the greed ,_,  ego and libido of the political and economic elite ._. 
There are trickledown effects ,_,  sure ._. 
When a politician steals money and decides to build a house ,_,  the poor bricklayers ,_,  carpenters ,_,  welders ,_,  sand suppliers ,_,  cement sellers and electricians will benefit ._. 
With those contracts coming steadily ,_,  they may be able to save up and buy cheap cars or build low -_: budget houses ._. 
Thus ,_,  the number of car and home owners will go up ,_,  but the society is not much better off for it ._. 
It will not translate to more clean water ,_,  affordable healthcare ,_,  better public schools and good sanitation ._. 
Two ,_,  maybe the country has really improved between 1999 and 2014 ,_,  but things were so bad before that it is practically impossible for us to feel the impact of the developments here and there ._. 
I bear witness that governments at all levels have executed some laudable projects over the years ._. 
I have seen these projects with my own eyes ._. 
They have built and equipped more hospitals ,_,  provided credit to small businesses ,_,  built more roads and created jobs over the years but things were so bad before that we just cannot feel the impact substantially ._. 
I like to use the example of someone who is dead thirsty ._. 
He needs a cup of water ._. 
You give him a teaspoonful ._. 
There is no way he can feel relieved ._. 
Yes ,_,  you gave him water ._. 
But in reality ,_,  it is as good as not giving him at all ._. 
Also ,_,  our population keeps growing ,_,  thereby reducing the marginal gains from economic growth ._. Three ,_,  our organised fight against poverty has been too tokenistic and ineffective ._. 
Every state and council will tell you they are into poverty alleviation ._. 
They have agencies designated for poverty alleviation ._. 
They give out loans for buses ,_,  tricycles ,_,  sewing machines ,_,  etc ._.  How effective are these initiatives We need to assess them properly ._. 
I believe the Federal Government should bear the biggest responsibility for the fight against poverty because they dictate the key policies that shape the economy ._. 
Poverty does not happen or worsen suddenly ._. 
Therefore ,_,  fighting or reducing it will also not happen suddenly ._. 
The three tiers of government must go back to the drawing board and tackle poverty in aggressive and verifiable ways ._. 
This is not the time to play politics with World Bank figures ._. 
Let's do that when we've put our house in order ._. 
Finally ,_,  I would love Nigeria to be grouped along with India and China ,_,  but not poverty -_: wise ._. 
Rather ,_,  it should be in terms of industrialisation ,_,  innovation and human resource development ._. 
That would be a good company to keep ,_,  trust me ._.  &lt;&lt;&lt; It is not as if Nigeria is worse off today than it was in 1999 � it is just that economic growth is not benefiting a vast majority of the people in a proper ,_,  economically viable chain ._. 
The billions of dollars we've earned have gone mainly into financing the greed ,_,  ego and libido of the political and economic elite &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;POWERLESS NIGERIANS To tackle worsening power supply in the country ,_,  Federal Government has issued a 60 -_: day ultimatum to contractors handling power distribution projects to complete their contracts or be sanctioned ._. 
Vice -_: President Namadi Sambo also announced government's readiness to assist power companies acquire transformers to enable them enhance power distribution across the country ._. 
He then directed the generation ,_,  transmission and distribution companies to resolve the problems facing their operations and end the blackout ._. 
Big deal ._. 
Our real problem is gas ._. 
No gas ._. 
And some gas pipelines are either damaged or moribund ._. 
No amount of ultimatums will resolve that ._. 
Fact ._. ROUGH RIDE I am a campaigner for alternative modes of transportation as our roads keep getting congested ._. 
The Lagos State government has done a lot to promote water transportation and this can be seen in the rise in patronage by Lagosians ._. 
However ,_,  frequent mishaps are threatening to reverse the gains ._. 
Last week ,_,  a boat capsized ,_,  claiming eight lives ._. 
Last month ,_,  13 died in another mishap in Festac ._. 
Also last month ,_,  10 persons died as a boat capsized near Navy Town ,_,  Apapa ._. 
These incidents are bound to have a negative impact on those who are already nervous of water travel ._. 
Frightening ._. KIDNAPPERS AS KINGS As so ,_,  another kidnappers' den is discovered ._. 
While we were still discussing the Soka saga in Oyo State ,_,  another den was discovered at Iyana Egbado ,_,  Ogun State ._. 
And yet another was discovered in Abeokuta ,_,  where four pregnant women were rescued after one of them managed to escape to alert the police ._. 
At Iyana Egbado ,_,  women's underwear were found ,_,  suggesting not just cases of kidnap but also rape ._. 
Clearly ,_,  this has been going on for a while unnoticed ,_,  and the police must now pay particular attention to this incidence ._. 
Citizens must be adequately enlightened and helpline opened for victims ._. 
Appalling ._. MURDER HE WROTE Isn't it amazing that in this age and time ,_,  police officers could come all the way from Abia State to Lagos to arrest someone whose offence ,_,  at best ,_,  could be described as libel The commando -_: style in the arrest of Chief Orji Uzor Kalu's media aide ,_,  Ebere Wabara ,_,  should be an embarrassment to the security agencies ._. 
Wabara was said to have wrongly accused someone of murder in the ongoing dog -_: eats -_: dog war of propaganda in Abia ,_,  but I would rather think that this should be a case of defamation of character ,_,  which can be handled in a civil and civilised manner ._. 
Indefensible ._.

Nigeria Customs Service NCS ,_,  Federal Operations Unit FOU Zone C ,_,  Owerri ,_,  Imo State has stepped up its anti -_: smuggling campaign as it has impounded several contrabands ._. These include 31 assorted types of vehicles estimated at N75 million illegally imported through the nation's borders;14 cartons of drugs called Tramadol with 300 pieces of 100 milligrams capsules suspected to have been illegally imported from England and with no NAFDAC officially approved registration numbers ._. Customs Area Controller CAC ,_,  NCS ,_,  FOU ,_,  Zone C ,_,  Owerri ,_,  Imo State ,_,  Mr ._. 
Victor David Dimka who disclosed in a statement said the tramadol capsules were deceitfully packed and concealed in a luxury bus along with many other contraband goods ._. A statement by the Chief Public Relations Officer CPRO of the unit ,_,  Mrs ._. 
Ifeoma Onuigbo ,_,  quoted the Dimka as saying that he would ensure that the poisonous drugs would be handed over to NAFDAC for necessary action ._. While showcasing seizures made by the unit within the past two weeks at Customs House ,_,  Benin City ,_,  Edo State ,_,  Dimka also revealed that 5 suspects are now in police net in connection with the dirty deal and would soon be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded ._. He assured that the synergy currently existing among NCS ,_,  Police ,_,  Nigerian Army ,_,  the State Security Services SSS and NAFDAC would be strengthen to drastically reduce the menace of smuggling in the country ._. 
The CAC also displayed bags of imported rice including fake mama Africa re -_: bagged rice valued at N160 ,_,  440 ,_, 000 containing 382 metric tonnes ._. Dimka ,_,  who is a Deputy Comptroller disclosed that the grand total of the duty paid value DPV of all the items seized is N235 ,_,  634 ,_, 000 ._. 
In spite of the upsurge of smuggling in the country ,_,  he expressed optimism that the scourge could be effectively tackled with the support and cooperation of all patriotic Nigerians with security agencies ._. He maintained that NCS would sustain its public enlightenment/sensitisation campaign on the dangers inherent in the illegal business of smuggling ,_,  patronage and consumption of contraband goods imported into the country ._. Said he :_:  The items were brought in with every amount ingenuity and if we are not able to check them ,_,  those who criminally brought them in would eventually have their way to the market ._. The CAC revealed that the DPV of the rice imported were N235 million just as he warned transporters to always be careful and mindful of the purpose for which their vehicles are being used at any point in time since ignorance of the usage of any vehicle for a criminal act can never be tolerated as an excuse ._.

It was my friend that introduced me to smuggling cannabis to South America ._.

Lagos � A 19yearold Pakistani ,_,  Iftikihar Muhammed Arslan ,_,  has been arrested by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency ,_,  NDLEA ,_,  for attempting to smuggle 25 parcels of heroin into the country ._. The suspect ,_,  who claimed to be a student of Punjab College in Pakistan ,_,  was apprehended at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport MMIA ,_,  Lagos ,_,  by the operatives when the illicit drug was discovered in his luggage during inward screening of passengers on board a Qatar airline flight ._. Vanguard gathered that seized drugs weighing 25 ._. 400kg ,_,  have an estimated street value of N228 million ._. Preliminary investigation has shown that the suspect left Lahore ,_,  Pakistan with the drugs to Abu Dhabi ,_,  United Arab Emirates ,_,  then Doha ,_,  in Qatar ,_,  from where he connected to Lagos ._. 
He is believed to be working for a Pakistani drug cartel ._. Spokesman of the agency ,_,  Mr Mitchell Ofoyeju ,_,  who described the incident as the single largest seizure of heroin at the Lagos airport since January ,_,  said the NDLEA commander at the Lagos Airport ,_,  Mr ._. 
Hamza Umar ,_,  found the 25 parcels of brownish substance that tested positive for heroin hidden in a smaller bag inside the suspect's luggage ._. Ofoyeju said the suspect was cooperating with the agency's team of investigators ._. Meantime ,_,  Arslan ,_,  who speaks English fluently ,_,  confessed how he got the drugs ._. According to him ,_,  I am a student of Punjab College and I am in Nigeria as a tourist because my friend told me that Victoria Island and Ikoyi are beautiful tourist centres ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  when I arrived at the Lagos airport ,_,  the heroin was found in my luggage ._. 
This is my first time of coming to Nigeria and I had intended to spend a week or two ._. In his reaction ,_,  Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA ,_,  Ahmadu Giade ,_,  who expressed delight over the arrest ,_,  said Nigeria was winning the fight against narcotics ._. He said :_:  This arrest and seizure will further send a warning to drug trafficking cartels that Nigeria is winning the fight against narcotics ._. 
NDLEA is prepared to halt the criminal activities of drug barons through a coordinated drug detection strategies ._. 
We are working very hard to also identify other members of the criminal group ._. 
We may never know who did it ._. 
We hardly do ._. 
And when we do ,_,  prosecution will so bungle it that a judge is left no choice but to refuse to convict ._. 
Insurgency wins Pyrrhic victory ._. 
Then callous carnage ,_,  like bloody Monday's in Nyanya ,_,  occurs ,_,  and the nation is at a standstill ,_,  dumbfounded ._. What took hours or may be days in planning was executed in a split second that fateful and tragic morning at the El -_: Rufa'i bus stop ._. 
In that split second ,_,  lives translated to the great beyond ._. 
Destinies were cut short for more than a hundred people ,_,  and for hundreds more ,_,  it is life with lasting trauma in bereavement ,_,  and dismemberment and vicious memories of mutilations and bloody flow from victims ._. Those who have the liver could watch the video and hear eye witness accounts over the moaning and groaning of the afflicted and the bewildered associates of victims ,_,  who themselves merely cheated death by a hair's breadth ._. 
Said one witness ,_,  what I saw was a gory sight ,_,  many human beings like myself were burning in cars ._. 
They wailed struggling and saying 'help me help me !_. '  ._. Then silence  -_:  the help never came ._. 
One shell -_: shocked woman could only ask no one in particular ,_,  what is this ,_,  what is this ,_,  what is thisTo say there is angst in the nation is to state what is plainly obvious ._. 
Nyanya ,_,  near Abuja is where ordinary folk like the foot soldiers of these insurgents live ._. 
It is an ironic life ._. 
The folks of Nyanya live to service the city of Abuja ,_,  in contradiction to the people for whom they work their life is brutish and devoid of all comforts ._. 
Overcrowded face -_: me -_: I -_: face you living quarters ,_,  with shared toilets pit latrines and kitchens ._. 
Even on foot ,_,  human traffic grinds to a halt until space can be found for one more step ._. 
In Nyanya live the lowest rungs of society  -_:  dreamers of making it big in Abuja and tolerating conditions far more squalid than those escaped from at home ._. 
To get to work in Abuja ,_,  residents of Nyanya leave home at dusk to take a position in the bus queue ._. 
Buses are overcrowded particularly the coaches popularly called el Rufa'i ,_,  for he introduced them when he was Minister of the Federal Capital Territory ._. 
The insurgents therefore chose the hour with the highest devilish intent ._. 
So far the believable story seems to be that they drove a car bomb into the bus park and detonated it ._. Broken ,_,  I know many Nigerians are like me ,_,  angry ,_,  frustrated ,_,  and pained ._. 
Those innocents left home this morning to earn an honest living ._. 
They may have prayed to God pleading 'Lord I hope this day is good ._. 
It was an early morning assembly of the expectant ._. 
They originated from all corners of Nigeria converging on Dream City that Abuja is different Nigerian nationalities ,_,  different faiths ,_,  assembled together by an all knowing God who was going to claim souls that belonged to him  -_:  over a hundred in one fell swoop ._. 
In time like this ,_,  one cannot but wax philosophical and build one's faith ._. As those victims readied for the bus ,_,  the insurgents readied the explosive devices ,_,  reminiscent of the titanic ,_,  even as the ship was being built ,_,  the iceberg was forming ,_,  while passengers bought tickets and booked seats ,_,  destiny had set ship and iceberg thousands of kilometres away ,_,  on a collision course ._. 
Yet ,_,  there is a difference ._. 
One cannot question an iceberg as to why it laid itself in the path of a ship laden with people in pursuit of happiness ._. 
But you do wish to ask those wicked agents of death ,_,  what pleasure they derived from such bloody annihilation simple folk struggling to eke out a living from this hellish fringe of paradise ._. 
What do they want that they have such an inhuman way of demandingIn one of the gory videos of the Nyanya blast ,_,  you hear someone's voice asking is this Nigeria; is this Nigeria; is this Nigeria It is a pertinent question ,_,  akin to David Diop's monologue on Africa in his poem Africa My Africa ._. 
One could continue where that bystander chok3d to a stop at ._. 
Nigeria is this you ,_,  whose back is bent under the weight of your many challenges ._. President Goodluck Jonathan did well to cancel a trip to the South West and visit the site of the blast while blood was still fresh on the queues ._. 
He reflected the national mood in the quest for an answer to the question  -_:  is this Nigeria Is this Nigeria Who is behind all thisWhoever claims responsibility for this dastardly act ,_,  Nigerians must rally round the flag and salute the troops having to turn their guns homewards upon a national threat that is within our borders ._. 
A nation is not cowed by insurgency ._. 
It rises up to the fight with stronger determination ._. 
Stakeholders must rally round the Government in all the ways imaginable ._. 
One of them as raised by Senate President David Mark for the media to sensitise society on security concerns ,_,  but it also needs to be emphasised that our bane as a nation is our corrupt nature ._. 
Leadership is not accountable and hence all strata of governance is afflicted ._. 
Our borders are porous ,_,  only on our side ._. 
Check points do not serve their purpose as long as N20 lets a bomb laden car pass ._. 
Nigeria suffers from massive smuggling of arms and drugs that our neighbours do not tolerate and it helps their safety ._. 
As long as the leadership plays dumb on high level corruption ,_,  insurgents will easily infiltrate the system be it SSS ,_,  police ,_,  the Armed Forces or the judiciary ._. Is it not also unthinkable that in all the arrests that have been made ,_,  we have not established a lead to the sponsors of this insurgency ,_,  given their ability to move funds around in execution of their activities We must bite that bullet ._. 
We must hold those sacred cows to account before we can successfully harness and reign in this monster that our leadership ineptitude has created ,_,  pitiably ._. 
The Chairman of the 2014 National Conference and former Chief Justice of Nigeria ,_,  Idris Kutigi ,_,  on Wednesday informed Conference delegates that committee work will begin on Tuesday after Easter break ._. The announcement followed submission of list of committee members and the leadership of each of the 20 committees to the Conference in plenary amidst complaints and applause from a cross -_: section of the delegates ._. The chairman informed delegates that 10 of the 20 committees will hold their sessions at the National Judicial Institute while the remaining 10 will sit at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers ._. It was agreed through a voice vote that delegates with genuine complaints on the composition of the committees ,_,  both the membership and the chairmen ,_,  co -_: chairmen and deputy chairmen should sort out the details with the Conference secretariat ._. He however stated that while such genuine complaints were being sorted out ,_,  normal committee sittings would commence as scheduled and that deliberations and decisions of committees would not be affected by the process ._. At the commencement of sitting on Wednesday ,_,  Justice Kutigi informed delegates that some of them might find their names in committees they did not indicate interest and that they should face the challenge of serving in such committees in the interest of the nation ._.

Governor of Anambra State ,_,  Chief Willie Obiano ,_,  has promised to buy a new gun -_: boat to support the Nigerian Navy ,_,  especially in the ongoing operations to rid the state of criminals ._. Obiano made the promise while reacting to the arrest of an arms dealer and four armed robbery suspects by the state Police command ._. The governor said the state government would also repair all grounded naval vessels to put them back into operation to enable the Navy secure the state's water -_: ways effectively ,_,  stressing that some of the arms were smuggled into the state through River Niger ._. Expressing delight at the breakthrough recorded by the Police ,_,  the governor said :_:  Ndi Anambra should go home and sleep ._. 
This war against criminals will be on through out the life of my administration ._. More criminals ,_,  drug barons and arms dealers will be arrested and their routes blocked ._. 
All criminals must be prosecuted and if convicted ,_,  face the full penalty for their offence ._. 
You know kidnapping attracts death penalty ._. 
We are going to ensure speedy trial of all those arrested ._. Obiano explained that the war against criminals had entered the second phase which would include going after the criminals ,_,  command and control activities ,_,  targeting those who supplied them arms and ammunition as well as blocking the routes through which they smuggled arms into the state ._. He said a structure was being worked out with the state Chief Judge to accelerate the dispensation of justice ,_,  while a special court might be set up to complement the conventional courts to ensure no criminal evaded the law ._. Said Governor Obiano :_:  We can't afford any delay in the delivery of justice in line with the resolve of this administration to sustain comprehensive fight against the criminals ,_,  the governor assured ._. Earlier ,_,  Anambra State Police command had recorded another breakthrough in the onslaught against criminals with the arrest of an arms dealer and four armed robbery suspects ._. Parading the suspects at the Special Anti -_: Robbery squad ,_,  SARS ,_,  headquarters ,_,  Awkuzu ,_,  the Police Public Relations Officer PPRO ,_,  Mr ._. 
Emeka Chukwuemeka restated the determination of the command to rid the state of all criminal elements in line with the resolve of the governor to achieve zero tolerance of crime ._. According to Mr ._. 
Chukwuemeka ,_,  the arms dealer ,_,  Mr ._. 
Alphonsus Ngwu from Ugwuoba in Enugu State ,_,  was arrested at his shop at the main market ,_,  Onitsha ._. The arms recovered from Mr ._. 
Ngwu include :_:  six pump actions guns ,_,  one revolver pistol ,_,  6 ,_, 390 live cartridges ,_,  62 rounds of 5 ._. 65mm live ammunition ,_,  74 rounds of 9mm live ammunition ,_,  12 magazines for AK 47 rifle ,_,  two magazines for K -_: 2 rifle ,_,  some dismantled parts of AK 47 ,_,  one general purpose machine gun ammunition and one smoke cartridge ._. Mr ._.

He said that the suspect was arrested some time ago but managed to escape until he was rearrested ._. The PPRO disclosed that members of the armed robbery gang who specialized in snatching of vehicles were arrested in Ajalli area ,_,  Orumba North with two 2 locally made pistols ,_,  twelve 12 cartridges and charms while some stolen vehicles have been recovered from them ._. The arms dealer admitted that he had been in the business for over fifteen years through smuggling and later selling of the arms ._.

A 15 -_: second drum roll and the title of the film ,_,  Deceptive Heart ,_,  comes crashing onto the screen in a groovy 1970s font ._. Less than 10 minutes into the Nollywood movie ,_,  the heart of plot is revealed :_:  A woman has two boyfriends and doesn't know what to do ._. The story moves as quickly as the film appears to have been shot ._. 
Some scenes are shaky ,_,  with cameras clearly in need of a tripod ,_,  and musical montages are often filled with pans of the same building ._. Most Nollywood movies are made in less than 10 days and cost about N4 ,_,  287 ,_,  500 $25 ,_, 000 ._. Fuelled by low budgets and whirlwind production schedules ,_,  Nigeria's film industry has grown by some estimates over the past 20 -_: plus years into the most prolific on Earth ,_,  pushing out more movies a year than Hollywood in California or Bollywood in Mumbai ,_,  India ._. Hollywood tends to portray Africa as an exotic land of deserts and giraffes populated by huddling masses ,_,  according to Samuel Olatunje ,_,  a Nollywood publicist known in the business as Big Sam ._. Nigerian movies are popular because they portray African people more accurately ,_,  Big Sam explains outside his single -_: room Lagos office ._. 
They explore African issues rarely touched on in Hollywood  -_:  -_:  magic ,_,  tribal loyalties ,_,  the struggle to modernize ._. Stories that you can relate to ,_,  he says ._. Ventures Africa business magazine says Nollywood knocks out 2 ,_, 000 titles a year and is the third -_: largest earner in the movie world ,_,  after Bollywood and Hollywood ._. 
The $250 -_: million industry employs more than a million people ._. Artists say Nigeria's bad infrastructure and chaotic legal system prevent them from making films that are as impressive in their quality as they are in quantity ._. You'll find that we're having to make do ,_,  legendary Nollywood actor Olu Jacobs explains at an exclusive country club in Lagos ._. Trained at Britain's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts ,_,  Jacobs says Nigerian artists often have the same artistic capacity as their Western counterparts ,_,  but not the same financial capacity ._. 
We're not happy because the finished product doesn't have the finish that it should have ,_,  he says ._. Later that day ,_,  Jacob's driver inches his car through grinding traffic in Lagos ,_,  the African megalopolis as chaotic and bustling as any Nollywood production scene ._. 
A young businessman in an SUV nearly cuts him off ._. 
The SUV driver's eyes grow wide when he recognizes Jacobs ,_,  and he smiles like a child meeting Santa Claus ._. 
He lets the actor's car pass in front ._. Nollywood was born ,_,  so the story goes ,_,  when Kenneth Nnebue ,_,  a video storeowner ,_,  had too many blank tapes in the early 1990s ._. 
To find a use for them ,_,  he shot Living in Bondage with a single camera for video ._. 
The protagonist joins a secret cult and kills his wife in a ritual sacrifice that wins him enormous wealth but leaves him haunted ._. 
The movie was an instant hit ,_,  selling 500 ,_, 000 copies ._. But at the country club ,_,  Jacobs says modern Nollywood is no accident ._. 
When he returned to Nigeria from the London stage in the early 1980s ,_,  he ,_,  like many other artists ,_,  knew he could make successful movies at home ._. We all knew that we had a market ,_,  he says ._. 
When I grew up ,_,  cinemas were always filled up ._. 
Stage performances were all ways full ._. 
Why shouldn't there beThe main problem for movie -_: makers ,_,  Jacobs says ,_,  is also the top complaint of almost every industry in Nigeria :_:  not enough power ._. 
Less than half the population of Africa's most populous country has access to government electricity ,_,  and even the wealthiest families deal with daily power cuts ._. 
Nigerian film producers pay a premium for fuel to run generators to keep the lights on and the equipment going ._. Piracy also cuts into profits ,_,  Jacobs says ._. 
After a film is released ,_,  producers have only a few weeks before illegally burned copies undercut their sales ._. 
Pirated Nigerian DVDs cost no more than a dollar or two and are available at markets in even the farthest corners of Africa ._. But these cheap DVDs have also helped the industry grow ,_,  making Nigerian movies wildly popular in Africa and among Africans overseas ._. Last year ,_,  Nollywood ventured off the continent entirely to screen Half of a Yellow Sun ,_,  a movie about Nigeria's 1960s civil war based on an award -_: winning novel by ChimamandaNgoziAdichie ,_,  at film festivals Toronto ,_,  London and Los Angeles ._. While it didn't get rave reviews ,_,  the Hollywood Reporter called it an epic -_: on -_: a -_: budget that will continue to draw audiences ._. 
Half of a Yellow Sun had a budget of about $8 million ,_,  the largest in Nollywood history ._. By comparison ,_,  The Hunger Games :_:  Catching Fire ,_,  based on a book by Suzanne Collins ,_,  had a budget of about $130 million and was one of the highest grossing Hollywood movies in 2013 ._. A week after the Los Angeles premiere of Half of a Yellow Sun ,_,  the cast and crew of a Nollywood soap opera ,_,  Remember Me ,_,  pack into a hot ,_,  borrowed apartment in Lagos ._.

Olu Michaels secures a red film over a harsh white light with masking tape before calling out Action !_. Then he silently drops to his hands and knees and crawls behind the cameraman to avoid casting shadows on the set ._. After the shoot ,_,  as a generator rumbles just far enough away from the set to avoid being picked up by microphones ,_,  Michaels says Nollywood films are improving rapidly because of intense competition ._. The quality of what we bring out now is not what we brought out ,_,  even five years ago ,_,  he says ._. Still ,_,  he says ,_,  the industry has a long way to go before its actors and directors have a chance to make millions of dollars ._. 
Warri � Suspected kidnappers of Mr ._. 
Ebikeme Clark ,_,  son of elder statesman ,_,  Chief Edwin Clark ,_,  kidnapped Wednesday ,_,  at Kiagbodo ,_,  Delta State ,_,  has reportedly contacted the family ,_,  demanding about N50 million ransom for his release ._. Delta State Commissioner of Police ,_,  Mr ._. 
Ikechukwu Aduba ,_,  however ,_,  told Saturday Vanguard that the police have arrested three of the suspected kidnappers and were inching closer to their hideout ,_,  warning that no ransom should be paid ._. He said one of them confessed that he participated in the planning stage of the kidnap ,_,  adding that the police were working with ex -_: militant leader ,_,  Government Ekpemupolo ,_,  alias Tompolo and other Ijaw groups to track down the kidnappers ._. Aduba said the kidnap was carried out by Ijaw kinsmen of Edwin Clark and the police would burst the syndicate ._. Elder statesman ,_,  Chief Clark was said to have briefed President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  the governor of Delta state ,_,  Dr ._.  Emmanuel Uduaghan and Mr ._. 
Aduba on the incident ._. It was gathered that he called the Commissioner of Police on Wednesday when his son was kidnapped and had been calling him frequently since then with Mr ._. 
Aduba assuring him that the police were doing everything possible to secure the release of his son ._. On how the ransom was demanded ,_,  a source told Saturday Vanguard yesterday ,_,  The kidnappers made contact with family members of Mr ._. 
Ebikeme Clark in the late hours of Thursday ,_,  April 3 ._. 
They kidnappers and Mr ._. 
Ebikeme Clark spoke with family members through Mr ._. 
Ebikeme Clark's phone ._. In their usual manner ,_,  the kidnappers demanded for ransom ._. 
We were informed it is within the region of N50 million ,_,  he added ._. But ,_,  there was a clear indication yesterday ,_,  that abductors may not have their way in the ransom demand ,_,  as the police ,_,  collaborating with ex -_: militant leaders were hot on their pursuit ._. Commissioner Aduba told Saturday Vanguard unofficially where the police suspected the kidnappers were hibernating and the rescue efforts ,_,  but pointed out ,_,  They are not for publication ._. Our independent investigation ,_,  however ,_,  showed the kidnappers were hiding somewhere in the creeks between Delta and Bayelsa states ._. IYC spokesman ,_,  Mr ._. 
Eric Omare ,_,  told Saturday Vanguard ,_,  yesterday ,_,  The IYC has mandated its officials in the riverine clans of Oporomor ,_,  Seimbiri ,_,  Ingbelebiri and Mein in Bayelsa and Delta States to swing into action and fish out the kidnappers of Mr ._. 
Ebikeme Clark ,_,  son of Ijaw National Leader and Former Federal Commissioner for Information ,_,  Chief E ._. 
K ._. 
Clark ._. 
IYC ,_,  investigation so far is to the effect that the kidnappers hideout may be somewhere in the creeks around Delta and Bayelsa States close to the coast ,_,  that is the communities near the sea though from experience kidnappers are never stationed in one place as they move from one place to the other to avoid been caught ._. 
To this extent ,_,  all the Ijaw communities and community leaders in the communities close to the coastal parts of Delta and Bayelsa States have been contacted to form rescue team to comb all the creeks ,_,  towns and villages in a bid to free Mr ._. 
Ebikeme Clark without delay ._. 
The Ijaw people and communities are totally against kidnapping ,_,  sea piracy and other social vices ._. Also ,_,  some Ex -_: Niger Delta freedom fighters have volunteered to join forces with the IYC and security agencies to effect the release of Mr ._. 
Ebikeme Clark ._. 
While we appreciate the pains the Clark family may be going through ,_,  the IYC reiterate its position that ransom should not be paid to kidnappers ._. 
This is another case of commercial kidnapping; hence payment of ransom must be discouraged ,_,  he said ._. His words ,_,  This incident coming shortly after the kidnap of the foster father of the President Jonathan and the relative of a Bayelsa State Commissioner has brought to the fore the need for all stakeholders in the Niger Delta to take drastic steps against kidnapping ,_,  sea piracy ,_,  oil theft and other social vices ._. While condemning these vices ,_,  we wish to state that there is a direct nexus between these crimes and the economic situation of our people ._. 
Therefore ,_,  the IYC hereby call on multinational oil companies and state governments whose revenue has increased as a result of cessation of militancy in the Niger Delta region to perform their role of creating/providing jobs in the post amnesty era ,_,  he added ._. He asserted ,_,  The concept of the Federal Government amnesty programme in the Niger Delta was for the federal government to mainly take care of the training while the oil companies and state governments are supposed to mainly handle the area of creation and provision of jobs ._. 
The IYC believes that creation of job opportunities is the long term solution to these social vices ._. Omare said ,_,  The IYC would come up with its anti  -_: kidnapping and anti -_:  sea piracy strategy after the all Ijaw youths summit to be hosted by the Bayelsa state government on how to fight sea piracy ,_,  kidnapping ,_,  oil theft and other social vices ._. 
To boost its maritime capability in safeguarding the nation's waterways from piracy and other illegalities ,_,  the Nigerian Navy NN is set to take delivery of two new warships built in the United States and China ._. The new warships ,_,  which will be joining other NN platforms ,_,  were custom -_: built in China and already over 50 naval personnel have already departed Nigeria for China to bring back the first vessel ,_,  an Offshore Patrol Vessel OPV ._. The China Shipbuilding and Offshore International Company had recently launched the NN's first of two P -_: 18N offshore patrol vessels and it was assigned the pennant number F91 ._. The launch of the first OPV also marked the hull formation ceremony of the second vessel ,_,  F92 and although the first OPV will be built entirely in China ,_,  between 50 and 70 per cent of the second ship will be constructed in Nigeria in an effort to enhance local shipbuilding capability and provide technology transfer ._. 
While delivery of F91 is expected in the middle of the year ,_,  the second vessel is also expected to arrive sometime this year and be completed then or early 2015 ._. The Flag Officer Commanding FOC Naval Training Command ,_,  Rear Admiral Goddy Anyankpele ,_,  who disclosed this to THISDAY ,_,  said the command played a role by training the personnel that would steer the vessel for its homeward journey back to Nigeria from China ._. He said ,_,  The training of naval officers and men that will bring the vessel home ,_,  was done at the command and it has commenced training for a new set of personnel that will travel to the United States to take custody of the United States Coast Guard Ship ,_,  Gallatine ._. Also ,_,  the command has also started training for prospective participants at the National Defence College ,_,  commonly called Cadre in naval parlance ,_,  which was adjudged very successful as the NDC qualifying examination result revealed over 90 per cent pass by naval officers ._. 
ProjectActNollywood ,_,  a non -_: governmental organization launched in March 2013 by President Goodluck Jonathan to support Nigeria's film industry had a one -_: day interactive session with Kannywood stakeholders ,_,  last Wednesday ._. The session ,_,  which held at the Tahir Guest Palace Hotel ,_,  Kano allowed the project implementation team get feedback on work done so far in the project ._. 
Members of northern Nigeria's film industry ,_,  better known as Kannywood ,_,  were well represented ,_,  aired their views on concerns and made suggestions as they discussed issues bothering on production ,_,  marketing ,_,  distribution and other areas of filmmaking as they affect the industry ._. According to the Project Co -_: coordinator ,_,  Dr ._.  Supo Olusi ,_,  a total of 156 Nollywood practitioners applied online to undergo training in and outside the country ._. Olusi ,_,  who is also Special Assistant to the Minister of Finance ,_,  encouraged practitioners to apply for training ,_,  as the capacity building fund was still open to all those wishing to apply ._. He ,_,  however ,_,  stressed that ,_,  funds are assessable only to practitioners who already have a track record of contributing to the industry ._. You should make the best use of the opportunity provided by the federal government to improve your socioeconomic status ,_,  Olusi said ._. Ali Nuhu ,_,  who was impressed by the turn out and interactions which took place said ,_,  This is a door opener which I believe will work ._. 
The new breed filmmakers are progressives in the sense that they are doing things out of the box and with creativity ._. 
This is unlike in the past when we bound by a lot of factors in the environment ._. Talking about distribution ,_,  Nuhu said ,_,  it would cost a lot to build multiplexes as exist around other parts of the world but local cinemas and viewing centre ,_,  can be built across northern Nigeria so that they are first point of contact between producers and distributors and serve as our Box Office ._. 
This can help determine how much a movie rakes in ._. 
This way ,_,  investors can get their monies before the works go on DVDs and also help curb piracy ._. Commending the initiative ,_,  Hasmisu Lamido Iyantama said ,_,  We are ready to cooperate but some of the conditions laid down for us to assess the facilities we can't meet ._. 
Kannywood hasn't benefited as much as Nollywood because of the shortcomings which we experience ._. 
I'm hoping that ProjectAct will be the breakthrough we've been yearning for ,_,  especially with recovering our monies invested and fighting piracy ._. Beneficiaries ,_,  who have been awarded grants based on their performances in the industry ,_,  are currently undergoing training at destinations like the London Film Institute and Colorado Film Institute in the US ,_,  while some others are undergoing training locally through institutions like the Del York Film Institute ._. 
The entertainment industry has worked towards improving the lives of people while unemployment rate has averaged almost five per cent for the period between 1976 and 1998 ._. 
But the statistics must be interpreted with caution as the entertainment industry has moved from grass to grace ._. 
ANTHONY ADA ABRAHAM writes ._. In the 1980s ,_,  Nigeria's economy was hardly as buoyant as it is today ._. According to the ongoing economic reform programme ,_,  plans are in place to put the economy on a recovery path ,_,  with an accompanying level of inflation that is totally minimal ._. 
Today ,_,  the Nigerian entertainment industry is ranked third ,_,  globally ,_,  in terms of quality of production and gross earnings ._. In 2013 ,_,  Robert Orya ,_,  managing director ,_,  Nigerian Export -_: Import Bank NEXIM ,_,  said Nollywood ranked third globally in gross earnings ._. 
According to him ,_,  the revenue the film industry has generated in the last three years was between $300m and $800m ._. The global film and entertainment industry generated about $90 ._. 6bn revenue in 2010 ,_,  Orya explained ,_,  saying ,_,  The revenue increased to $102 ._. 7 bn in 2012 ._. 
Most of these revenue streams are from theatrical distribution ._. 
North America contributed the largest market share of about 40 per cent ._. 
Europe ,_,  Middle East and Africa accounted for 24 per cent ,_,  Latin America 20 per cent ,_,  and Asia Pacific made only three per cent contribution ._. In addition ,_,  a report released in London in 2012 ,_,  by Euromonitor International and Reed Exhibitions Limited ,_,  organisers of the World Travel Market WTM ,_,  predicated a Gross Domestic Product GDP growth in Africa ,_,  as a result of the boom in the local film industry dubbed 'Nollywood' ._. 
The GDP growth figure for the African region was contained in a report ,_,  titled :_:  'WTM Global Trends Report 2012' ._. The report explained that Nigeria's massive film industry ,_,  'Nollywood' ,_,  is a rising star in Africa's tourism industry ,_,  just as it declared it the world's second largest film industry ,_,  volume -_: wise ,_,  after India's Bollywood and ahead of the USA's Hollywood ,_,  with more than 2 ,_, 000 films produced annually ._. Specifically ,_,  the report predicated this GDP growth in Africa to be at 5 ._. 2 per cent in 2012 and 2013 ,_,  while trips/arrivals will rise to 4 ._. 5 per cent in 2012 and 4 ._. 6 per cent in 2013 ,_,  adding that intra -_: regional travels is crucial for the African tourism industry ,_,  due to strong business ,_,  linguistic and cultural links between many countries ._. Nigeria's Nollywood industry ,_,  now captured under Motion pictures ,_,  sound recording and music production ,_,  has made a huge leap to about N9trn in size ._. Analysts had said the movie segment made about N1 ._. 72trn in 2013 ._. Motion pictures ,_,  sound recording and music production ,_,  is one of the 13 new activities that have been included in the computation framework ._. 
Others are entertainment ,_,  research ,_,  patents and copyrights ,_,  etc ._.  The number of economic activities reported in the rebased GDP computation framework was increased to 46 as against 33 in the previous series ._. According to Business Day ,_,  the rebasing exercise shows the huge leap how the entire entertainment sector had been hugely underrated over the years ._. The sector was earlier classified amongst 'other services' that barely contribute N5bn to the annual GDP ._. The share has risen ,_,  sharply ,_,  from its once -_: insignificant status to become the first five ._. What surprises me the most is the 'Motions pictures ,_,  sound recording and music production' ,_,  which jumped to N9trn ,_,  which is a huge amount ._. 
I didn't expect that kind of jump ._. 
Initially ,_,  it was under 'other services' where items that are too small are captured during the GDP computation ,_,  a source said ._. Also ,_,  in the last five years ,_,  the industry has grown in terms of quality and has been rated the third most valuable movie industry in the world ,_,  behind Hollywood and Bollywood ._. 
The development has also impacted on returns ._. Victor Okhai ,_,  a film -_: maker ,_,  says a new crop of film makers have ,_,  over the years ,_,  brought some level of professionalism into the industry ._. Nollywood lauds the growthNollywood directors and investors ,_,  on Monday ,_,  hailed the industry's inclusion in Nigeria's economic data for the first time ,_,  calling it a recognition of the sector's growing power and influence ._. Africa's most populous nation and leading oil producer became the continent's largest economy on Sunday ,_,  when the government announced the long -_: overdue recalculation of her gross domestic product ._. When the last revision was carried out in 1990 ,_,  Nollywood's contribution to the economy was negligible ._. But statistics indicated that the industry ,_,  which has a huge following across Africa ,_,  was now worth some N853 ._. 9bn $5 ._. 1bn ,_,  �3 ._. 7bn or 1 ._. 2 per cent of GDP ._. It is significant that the economic importance of Nollywood is being better recognised ,_,  Zack Orji ,_,  one of the industry's most prominent and accomplished artistes ,_,  told the AFP ._. The founder and chief executive of video -_: on -_: demand firm iROKOtv ,_,  Jason Njoku ,_,  said he was not surprised by the data and how it reflects Nigeria's status as one of the world's leading film production centres ._. It Nollywood has been growing steadily for the past 20 years and can ,_,  legitimately ,_,  be uttered in the same breath as Hollywood ._.  when it comes to movie output data ,_,  with between 1 ,_, 500 and 2 ,_, 000 movies being made every year ,_,  he added ._. The British -_: educated entrepreneur ,_,  whose firm has been dubbed the African Netflix ,_,  said the inclusion in economic data was a landmark and reflected Nollywood's dynamism ._. Nigeria's revision of GDP data saw the size of the economy jump from $264bn in 2012 to $453bn ,_,  with projections of a further increase in 2013 to $510bn ._. The exercise was carried out to factor in changes in production and consumption over the last 24 years and showed a significant shift in the structure of the economy ,_,  according to the government ._. Telecommunications ,_,  for example ,_,  were also included to reflect the explosion in mobile phone ownership in recent years ._. The United Nations said ,_,  last May ,_,  that Nollywood is estimated to employ some 1 ,_, 000 ,_, 000 people and had the potential to create 1 ,_, 000 ,_, 000 more in the future if properly managed ._. Its release of about 50 films a week puts it in the same bracket in terms of production with movie -_: mad India ,_,  although revenues  -_:  -_:  thought to be about $590m a year  -_:  -_:  are considerably less ._. Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  last year ,_,  announced a N3bn cash injection to develop Nollywood ,_,  which was considered a fair recognition of the sector's importance ._. Orji said problems remained  -_:  not least film piracy  -_:  but added that planned improvements to distribution would help ensure revenues generated would get back to those involved in production ._. Nollywood films are as loud ,_,  brash and argumentative as the country itself ,_,  frequently tackling social and cultural issues and relying heavily on melodrama ._. They are thought to cost as little as $25 ,_, 000  -_:  -_:  a fraction of the $250m on average that it takes to make a film in Hollywood  -_:  -_:  and can be turned around within a month from filming to sale ._. Most films are sold as DVDs at the roadside ,_,  either at market stalls ,_,  from wheelbarrows or by hawkers at traffic lights ._. These are the rough edges which cannot be overlooked for an industry touted to be on its way to becoming world -_: class ._. 
Yaounde � Officials from Francophone Africa say plummeting customs revenue could lead to severe financial difficulties and slow development ._. 
Cross -_: border trade and the usual taxes it generates have taken a serious hit because of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea ,_,  Boko Haram activities in Nigeria ,_, and the persistent crisis in the Central African Republic ._. The drop in customs revenue ,_,  caused by conflict ,_,  piracy and terrorism ,_,  is a growing problem for governments across West and Central Africa ._. At a meeting this week in Yaounde ,_,  organized by the Global Forum on Transparency ,_,  officials said the Central African Republic has lost nearly all of the $6 million is usually receives from customs dues ._. They said other countries in the region ,_,  such as Gabon ,_,  the Republic of Congo ,_,  Chad ,_,  and Sudan ,_,  have lost up to 40 percent of their customs revenue ._. Some of the loss stems from an increase in illegal or undocumented trade; some of it comes from a loss in trade across borders ,_,  as violence makes travel dangerous or difficult ._. Epeh Nkongho ,_,  who works in surveillance for Cameroon's customs agency ,_,  says governments need to take action or face the loss in revenue and a failure to meet development goals ._. You will hear of threats coming from terrorists acts groups like Boko Haram ._. 
We know of the maritime pirates ._. 
We must make sure that we control our borders to make sure that all this illicit trade does not happen ,_,  said Nkongho ._. He says customs officers need to be empowered to be able to face their new challenges ._. It is really not a matter of arms ,_,  it is a matter of intelligence ._. 
We need to carry on cooperation with the other forces of defense to have information on how they terrorists operate ._. 
Even though we have the arms ,_,  that is not the tactic or the strategy to counter some of this crimes ,_,  he said ._. Cameroon Finance Minister Alamine Ousman Mey says customs departments in Africa should work together to stop terrorist movements from harming their economies ._. He says it is important to improve surveillance ,_,  strategic information sharing and transparency and track down those who decide to disrespect laws and adds that it should be done in a transparent manner ._. The most serious problem raised during this week's meeting in Yaounde is the rise of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea ._. 
Data from the International Maritime Bureau shows about 1 ,_, 000 seafarers and fishermen were attacked by pirates armed with guns or knives in the gulf last year ._. 
Abuja � THE British Government has pledged its assistance and mutual collaboration with the Nigeria Police Force in resolving terrorism ,_,  kidnapping ,_,  piracy and other related crimes ._. The pledge was made at the Force Headquarters ,_,  Abuja during a courtesy visit by the British High Commissioner ,_,  Dr ._.  Andrew Pocock ,_,  to the Inspector -_: General of Police ,_,  Mohammed Abubakar ._. Frank Mba ,_,  the Force Public Relations Officer ,_,  said this was part of Britain's contribution to the ongoing efforts at addressing the current security challenges in the country ._. �At the end of the meeting ,_,  the High Commissioner said the British Government would assist the Nigeria Police in the areas of capacity building especially as it relates to acquiring requisite skills in general investigation ,_,  scene of crime management ,_,  counter -_: terrorism ,_,  bomb diffusion/disposal and tracking of kidnappers ,_, � added Mba from Abuja ._. He added that the Inspector -_: General of Police thank the British Government for its long -_: standing support for the Nigeria Police and pledged the commitment of the Force to mutual sharing of intelligence as may be dictated by the security and law enforcement needs of both countries ._. �The IGP ,_,  who described the relationship between the Nigeria Police and its British counterparts as a mutually rewarding one promised that both countries will work hard to preserve and promote this long -_: standing partnership ,_, � Mba said ._. He said the IGP also pledged that the Nigeria Police will continue to provide necessary support and relevant background information that would help in tackling the challenges of identity theft ,_,  visa fraud and other forms of criminalities in both countries ._. 
Timi Dakolo came into limelight after he won the maiden edition of Idols West Africa several years back ._. 
Since then ,_,  his life and career have taken a turn for the better ._. 
Recently ,_,  Esther Onyegbula caught up with Timi and he opened up on how it all started ,_,  the journey so far ,_,  the challenges ,_,  the aspirations and the future ._. My grandma's death and the Nigerian Idol West AfricaDuring the competition my grandmother who I lived with for many years before I got into the competition passed on ,_,  I was down and I wanted to quit the competition but I stayed back because of the encouragement I received from friends and fellow contestants ._. And I noticed that each time I went out with other contestants people would tell me not to disappoint them ,_,  and that they were voting for me ._. 
From top ten to top three and as God would have it ,_,  I won ._. Unlike most celebrities winning ten thousand dollars and a brand new car ,_,  didn't change him ,_,  he was still the same old loving ,_,  talented Timi ._. After winning the ten thousand dollars and a brand new car I didn't change ._. I was still my old self because I would still board a bike on the street ,_,  buy gala on the road ._. 
But life generally changed ,_,  apparently in the whole of West Africa when I won the Idols ._. Anywhere I go ,_,  people recognized me ,_,  complimenting my unique voice ,_,  which was contrary to what one music director once told me that I should join the drama group and stop singing ,_,  because according to him ,_,  I didn't have a good voice ._. Milestones and career investmentI have achieved a lot ._. 
Before the show I didn't know much about music ,_,  but after I won ,_,  I had to invest in my music career ._. 
First I had to learn the rudiments of music ,_,  learn the business side of music ,_,  learning what it takes to write good songs ._. 
In the process ,_,  because I am an introvert ,_,  it took me time to realize that in music you can't do it alone ._. 
You need people who know the nitty -_: gritty of the business ._. And I had to learn fast because I didn't want people to be holding me ransom for any reason ._. 
So I had to read a lot of online articles and books because I have always loved to read ._. 
In the process ,_,  my status changed ,_,  I was making money ,_,  and things changed ,_,  people I used to depend on started depending on me ._. Marriage changed my lifeAfter I got married and started having kids ,_,  my life changed ,_,  I no longer think of myself alone ._. 
I no longer do 'wants' I do 'needs' ,_,  not that I can't afford to do 'want' but because I need to plan for the future of my kids ._. Marriage has made me a full grown man ,_,  I have left 'wants' for 'needs' ,_,  I think for a lot of people ,_,  not just for my immediate family ,_,  and I save and invest more ._. 
And I look at things differently ._. 
I learn a lot from my children ,_,  just by watching them do their thing ._. 
I create balance between work and family life ,_,  so that one doesn't suffer for the other ._. Initial challengesI have always been a very meticulous person; I have always known what I wanted in life ._. 
Even before I won West Africa Idols ,_,  I had written my goals within a five year time frame ,_,  the kind of music that I want to do ,_,  where I want to be in five -_: years time ,_,  the knowledge I want to acquire in five years time ,_,  the type of instrument I want to be playing in five years time ._. While I was busy equipping myself ,_,  people were worried that the runner -_: ups of the competition were in the limelight while I was nowhere ._. 
My response to their complaint then ,_,  was that for everything under the sun there is a time ._. 
I would rather be slow and hit it late than rush and miss it ._. 
And if I miss it they are going to be the same people that would crucify me tomorrow if anything goes wrong ._. One of the challenges that I faced was that ,_,  even though people loved my kind of music they doubted if I could survive in the industry ._. 
Because they felt my kind of songs are not meant for this industry ._. 
Music must not be shallow ,_,  or too deep ,_,  music cuts across barriers ,_,  because it is more of the spirit than rhythm ._. 
Financial challenge of doing it all by myself ,_,  and trying to convince people that this is the kind of music that I want to do in this part of the world and all that ._. Inspired by evergreen musicI grew up in a house where they used to play those turn -_: table records and we used to play a lot of deep reggae music ,_,  like Burning Spear and Bob Marley ._. 
Music that would leave you with a message ._. 
And each time I listen to deep music it triggers the thinking part of me ._. 
I see myself doing music for a long while; I don't want to be a flash in the pan ._. 
I don't want to do songs that after three months people would have forgotten it ._. 
I want to do music that will outlive me ._. 
I want to do evergreen music that will be relevant in the next generation ._. Genre of musicI really don't have a genre of music ,_,  what happens is that the music comes ,_,  sometimes I write my music ,_,  at other times ,_,  I work with people ._. 
I basically don't have a part to play when the rhythm comes ,_,  sometimes I will be lying down ,_,  or doing something else when the inspiration comes ._. 
It comes in soft rock ,_,  soul ,_,  R&B ,_,  highlife or reggae  ._. Coping with female fansI appreciate my female friends a lot ,_,  but I tell them that I can't promise anything ,_,  I am not just married but I am happily married ._. 
Although some female fans don't care if you are married or not ,_,  those are the female fans I avoid like plague ._. 
Actually I haven't had any scandals because I spend a lot of time with my family except when I have shows ._. 
From a distance I can smell trouble ._. The Nigeria music industryThe Nigeria music industry is not well structured ,_,  like the music industry of the western world or South Africa ._. 
When you talk of royalty payments ,_,  artistes are not benefiting as much as they should from their intellectual works ._. 
A lot of things are involved in music ,_,  from the record label ,_,  to the song producers ,_,  to the publishers ,_,  to the radio stations ._. 
In a standard clime ,_,  a lot of people get paid ,_,  from a song ,_,  the producers ,_,  song writers ,_,  artiste ,_,  record label ,_,  but in Nigeria it is not like that ._. 
Basically ,_,  what artiste make money from here ,_,  is ring back tunes and shows ,_,  that is because a lot of things are not in place ._. 
The biggest problem we are also facing is piracy ._. The futureI want to continue doing good music ,_,  being a good husband ,_,  and winning awards ._. 
Sincerely I am interested in doing good music ,_,  if in the process awards are won ,_,  it is an added bonus ._. Message to my fansFans ._.   ._. get ready ,_,  I am coming out with a new album titled 'Love and Consequences' ._. 
Love is one part of it ,_,  the consequences of love is another part of it ,_,  inspired by my experiences and that of others ._. 
I am also working on the video for Iyawo Mi ._.

Addressing newsmen in Lagos ,_,  the Flag Officer Commanding FOC ,_,  Western Naval Command ,_,  Rear Admiral Samuel Ilesanmi Alade ,_,  stated that the event is very important as it concerns maintenance of security in the nation's maritime environment ._. There is no doubt that the huge resources and potential in the Gulf of Guinea are being undermined by multifaceted domestic ,_,  regional and international threats and vulnerabilities ._. 
Rather than contributing to the stability and economic prosperity of countries in this region ,_,  pervasive insecurity in this resource laden maritime environment has resulted in multi -_: billion dollars losses annually ._. 
Nigeria ,_,  like any other maritime nation relies on the sea for harvesting of resources ,_,  commerce and international trade ._. 
For some years ,_,  efforts have been intensified to tackle the security challenges of piracy ,_,  poaching ,_,  smuggling ,_,  oil theft ,_,  trafficking and other transnational crimes ,_,  he added ._. 
Lagos � A LEADING global technology firm welcomed the recent arrest of officials running a firm that sold counterfeit software ._. Microsoft's local office in Lagos hailed the arrest of Arewa Systems Limited by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC saying it would deter other firms from engaging in similar activities ._. The officials were arrested following a consumer tip -_: off and petition to the local law enforcement authorities ._. Microsoft's Anti -_: Piracy Attorney in Nigeria ,_,  Francis Chuka Agbu ,_,  commended the capture adding it would go a long way to sanitize the software market ._. �The strident message that this intervention sends is that computer software albeit an intellectual property qualifies better as a literary work that must be protected from the exploitation of merchants of counterfeiting and crass opportunism ._. Additionally ,_,  the theft of such creative expressions fixed in a tangible medium of expression constitutes a serious economic crime in Nigeria under Sections 18 & 46 of the Economic & Financial Crimes Commission Act ._. This arrest surely sends a signal to all dealers in imitation and fake products ,_,  big or small ,_,  that it is no longer business as usual ._. �Anti -_: Piracy Manager ,_,  Microsoft Nigeria ,_,  Temofe Ugbona ,_,  said innocent citizens had fallen victim to the counterfeit software business ._. �Quite a number of resellers abound in the country that are in possession of high quality counterfeit software that is packaged like genuine software  -_:  a trend resulting in many consumers ,_,  who believe they are purchasing software from a reliable source ,_,  unknowingly becoming victims to software piracy ._.

Software piracy remains unabated despite legislation and awareness creation by regulatory authorities and relevant agencies ._. The software piracy rate in Nigeria is estimated at more than 80 percent ._.

The company was alleged to be producing high quality counterfeit software ._. The raid ,_,  which followed a consumer tip -_: off and petition to the local law enforcement authorities ,_,  is aimed at curbing unsafe software in the country and to address the harmful impact of such software on individuals as well as the Nigerian economy ._.

Senior Advocate of Nigeria SAN ,_,  and Partner in the Law firm of Lexavier Partners ,_,  who doubles as Microsoft's Anti -_: piracy Attorney in Nigeria ,_,  Francis Chuka Agbu ,_,  said :_:  The theft of such creative expressions fixed in a tangible medium of expression constitutes a serious economic crime in Nigeria under Sections 18 & 46 of the Economic & Financial Crimes Commission Act ,_,  Cap E1 LFN 2010 and Section 491 Criminal Code Act Cap C28 LFN 2010 ._. To all the dealers in imitation and fake products ,_,  big or small ,_,  it is no longer business as usual ._. Government is not alone in this quest to tackle the menace as many organisations in the country are clamouring for a safer business space ._. 
Organisations have frequently organised awareness workshops and enlightenment campaigns one of which is the Microsoft Play it Safe Day ,_,  designed to drive global awareness across businesses ,_,  government organisations ,_,  and consumers of the increased risk of cyber security issues as a direct result of pirated software ._.

Honest resellers ,_,  who sell only genuine software ,_,  are put at an unfair disadvantage ,_,  and ultimately the whole economy feels the effects ,_,  Ugbona added ._. According to a new joint study conducted by International Data Corporation IDC ,_,  and the National University of Singapore NUS ,_,  global consumers are expected to spend $25 billion and waste 1 ._. 2 billion hours this year because of security threats and costly computer fixes stemming from malware on pirated software ._.

Seeking greater military involvement in Africa ,_,  the German navy is participating in the Obangame Express military exercise in the Gulf of Guinea ._. 
Training local soldiers in search vessels plays a big role ._. More than 30 warships from 20 countries are engaged in major maneuvers along the West African cost ._. 
In addition to 11 West African nations ,_,  France ,_,  Germany ,_,  Portugal ,_,  Spain and the Netherlands as well as Denmark ,_,  Turkey ,_,  Brazil and the United States have dispatched ships ,_,  making the training maneuver one of Africa's largest ._. Of the non -_: African participants ,_,  Germany has dispatched the most vessels :_:  one frigate ,_,  one corvette and two supply vessels with more than 400 military personnel ._. 
The ships and their crews are located outside the Nigerian port of Lagos where they are waiting for the sea phase of the military maneuver to begin on Saturday ._. Keen US interestObangame Express is designed to build maritime security ,_,  capacity and capability in the nations within this region  -_:  at a regional ,_,  cooperative level ,_,  said US Navy Capitan Nancy Lacore ,_,  who has had a role in organizing this year's maneuvers ._. The United States is keenly interested in seeing West African maritime forces handle difficult situations without oversea support ._. 
That's the reason why the US High Command for Africa US -_: AFIRCOM launched the Obangame Express series of military exercises four years ago ._. 
One of these maneuvers takes place every year along the West African coast but never has the participation been as high as it is this year ._. It's also no coincidence that the Gulf of Guinea is the site of the exercise and that Nigeria ,_,  one of Africa's largest oil exporters ,_,  is heavily involved ._. 
The country ,_,  which is hosting this year's maneuver ,_,  is providing many military facilities and warships ._. Proud of good relationsWest Africa and particularly Nigeria are confronted with numerous problems ,_,  according to Nigerian Rea Admiral Samuel Alade ._. 
First of all ,_,  we have oil theft ,_,  which has an international dimension ,_,  he said ._. 
We also have an issue of piracy and people who fish illegally in our waters ._. 
These are challenges in the Gulf of Guinea that we feel we have to tackle very quickly ._. The admiral was especially proud of the good relations between the Nigerian and German navies ._. 
Germany ,_,  he said ,_,  has not only delivered ships but also trained soldiers ._. 
That Germany has dispatched four ships to the military maneuver ,_,  he added ,_,  is further proof of the good relations between the countries and militaries ._. Although its warships are anchored off the coast of Lagos while waiting for their orders ,_,  some crew members are already actively engaged on land ._. 
For more than 10 days ,_,  a special unit has been training Nigerian soldiers about 20 kilometers outside the city ._. 
Three so -_: called boarding soldiers trained to search ships have been dispatched from the Eckernf�rde naval base in northern Germany to Lagos ._. Integrated months ago into preparations for the maneuver ,_,  the unit is now training together with soldiers from Benin ,_,  Ivory Coast ,_,  Ghana ,_,  Nigeria and Togo as well as Spain and the US to learn how to search ships and provide medical care to wounded comrades ._. While part of the group practices applying bandages in an air -_: conditioned classroom ,_,  the boarding soldiers stand sweating between wooden walls in an overheated room designed to simulate the interior of a ship ._. 
The armed teams feel their way through the imaginary ship ,_,  searching one room after the other ,_,  and provide backup support ._. 
They need to be able to identify cardboard targets as friend or foe within a fraction of a second ._. A German officer whose name can't be disclosed observes the scene ._. 
After 10 days of joint training ,_,  his initial doubts have largely disappeared ._. 
Not only are the Nigerian boarding soldiers well trained ,_,  but Nigerian members of the Special Boat Service SBS are also well equipped ._. 
Their boats ,_,  for instance ,_,  are powered by 250 -_: PS motors ,_,  he said ._. In these rubber dinghies ,_,  the SBS team members chase suspicious vessels in pursuit of oil thieves or pirates ._. 
This isn't fun when it's real ,_,  one member of the SBS team said ._. 
The unit with about 200 soldiers is among the Nigerian army's special forces ._. 
In the six years of its existence ,_,  the soldiers have boarded and searched numerous boats ._. Grateful for supportOther maritime units still lack this experience ,_,  on the other hand ,_,  and are grateful for the practical support provided by German and the US teams ._. Everything is fine; we came without anything but were equipped so that we can now search ships ,_,  said one soldiers from Ghana ._. A colleague from Nigeria added :_:  We have come together here to share experiences  -_:  I really appreciate it ._. Author Alexander Drechsel ,_,  Adrian Kriesch /jrbEditor Sean Sinico
Today we suspend our Epistles to Confab Delegates to turn to something hot off the press  -_:  Africa Report No ._.  216 from the Brussels ,_,  Belgium -_: based International Crisis Group ,_,  ICG Thursday April 3 ,_,  2014 ,_,  the Group released its Curbing Violence in Nigeria II :_:  The Boko Haram Insurgency ._. 
The 62 -_: page report ,_,  issued from its headquarters in Brussels and simultaneously from its Africa Regional Offices in Abuja ,_,  Dakar and Nairobi ,_,  contains a detailed Executive Summary and some far -_: reaching Recommendations to the Nigerian Government ._. 
Excerpts of the Summary and Recommendations are the only two sections this Column can accommodate because of space constraints ._. 
The Column is grateful to Brother Aminu Inuwa Muhammad for the alert on the report ._. 
For the full report ,_,  go to ICG's website or email Brother Aminu ._. There are two reasons why this Report is considered important :_:  one ,_,  since the ICG is considered a relative neutral party in this crisis ,_,  it may be expected to be unbiased in its observations even though ,_,  like any other organisation ,_,  it may have its own interests; and two ,_,  it may happen that ,_,  because of our limitations ,_,  the governments Federal and Northern States and agencies security and military that are addressed by the Report's Recommendations may not notice the report or act on it in good time ,_,  it may be worthy to draw their attention ._. EXCERPTS FROM ICG'S EXECUTIVE SUMMARY :_:  Boko Haram's four -_: year -_: old insurgency has pitted neighbour against neighbour ,_,  cost more than 4 ,_, 000 lives ,_,  displaced close to half a million ,_,  destroyed hundreds of schools and government buildings and devastated an already ravaged economy in the North East ,_,  one of Nigeria's poorest regions ._. 
It overstretches federal security services ,_,  with no end in sight ,_,  spills over to other parts of the north and risks reaching Niger and Cameroon ,_,  weak countries poorly equipped to combat a radical Islamist armed group tapping into real governance ,_,  corruption ,_,  impunity and underdevelopment grievances shared by most people in the region ._. Boko Haram is both a serious challenge and manifestation of more profound threats to Nigeria's security ._. 
Unless the federal and state governments ,_,  and the region ,_,  develop and implement comprehensive plans to tackle not only insecurity but also the injustices that drive much of the troubles ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  or groups like it ,_,  will continue to destabilise large parts of the country ._. 
Yet ,_,  the government's response is largely military ,_,  and political will to do more than that appears entirely lacking ._. Most Nigerians are poorer today than they were at independence in 1960 ,_,  victims of the resource curse and rampant ,_,  entrenched corruption ._. 
Agriculture ,_,  once the economy's mainstay is struggling ._. 
In many parts of the country ,_,  the government is unable to provide security ,_,  good roads ,_,  water ,_,  health ,_,  reliable power and education ._. 
The situation is particularly dire in the far north ._. 
Frustration and alienation drive many to join self -_: help ethnic ,_,  religious ,_,  community or civic groups ,_,  some of which are hostile to the state ._. It is in this environment that the group called Boko Haram usually translated loosely as Western education is forbidden by outsiders emerged ._. 
It is an Islamic sect that believes corrupt ,_,  false Muslims control northern Nigeria ._. 
The group and fellow travellers want to remedy this by establishing an Islamic state in the north with strict adherence to Sharia Islamic law ._. In May 2013 ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan declared an emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa states and deployed additional troops that with the help of vigilantes drove Boko Haram from most cities and towns ._. 
He also established a committee to negotiate a settlement with its leadership ,_,  with little success ._. 
On 18 March 2014 ,_,  National Security Advisor Mohammed Sambo Dasuki announced a soft approach to addressing the root causes of terrorism ,_,  but it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented ._. The movement ,_,  never very hierarchical ,_,  is more dispersed than ever ,_,  with many leaders in the Adamawa mountains ,_,  Cameroon ,_,  and Niger ._. 
Its isolated leader ,_,  the violent Abubakar Shekau ,_,  probably has little daily control over cells ,_,  and it is fragmenting into factions ,_,  including the relatively sophisticated Ansaru ,_,  which focuses more on foreign targets ._. 
Able to move fairly freely ,_,  these groups are unlikely ever to be completely suppressed ,_,  unless the government wins local hearts and minds by implementing fundamental political reforms to address bad governance ,_,  corruption and underdevelopment ._. 
Insecurity in much of the north may also worsen political violence and undermine the credibility of the 2015 elections ,_,  further damaging government legitimacy ._. ICG'S RECOMMENDATIONS :_:  To ensure greater human security in northern Nigeria ,_,  better protection from Boko Haram attacks and a more law -_: abiding ,_,  better resourced ,_,  professional security service; and to switch from a mainly military approach to the challenge from Boko Haram ,_,  and radicalism in general ,_,  to one more attuned to root causes :_:  -_: To Nigeria's Federal Government :_:  Discontinue heavy -_: handed military and police methods that risk pushing yet more restless ,_,  jobless and frustrated youths into violence and extremism; Begin to address impunity and a main Boko Haram demand by completing prosecution of the police officers alleged to have extra -_: judicially executed Mohammed Yusuf; and investigate and prosecute crimes allegedly committed by the security services ,_,  government officials state and federal and Boko Haram members; Recognise that unless issues of bad governance and systemic corruption are addressed vigorously and transparently ,_,  all other measures will be nothing but stop -_: gaps; Free up the necessary national resources to address sustained economic hardship ,_,  rising inequality and social frustration by expanding and strengthening the anti -_: corruption agencies ,_,  and ensure they work effectively at state and local levels ,_,  free of political manipulation; Begin to tackle the root causes of growing radical Islamic and ethnic militancy by fully developing and implementing a Far North Development Commission ,_,  similar to the Niger Delta Development Commission ,_,  with a mandate that includes coordinating anti -_: desertification campaigns ,_,  developing large -_: scale irrigation ,_,  agriculture ,_,  power and road projects and promoting small businesses that could create jobs for youths; and do so in a transparent ,_,  consultative and accountable manner; Take steps to change the climate of secrecy and fear around radical Islam by encouraging greater public discussion on the causes of and ways to address radicalism; Accredit senior ambassadors and defence attach�s to all neighbouring countries and meet with them frequently to review the domestic and transnational security situations ._. To state governments in the north :_:  Work with northern political ,_,  traditional and religious elites to disarm ,_,  de -_: radicalise and re -_: integrate Islamist militants; Reform the Qur'anic educational system by introducing a dual curriculum as in Kano and paying teachers' salaries so as to relieve pupils of the need to beg for their upkeep; Use the Northern Governors' Forum to set high standards of transparent and accountable state governance ._. To Nigeria's international and regional partners :_:  Continue to build bi -_:  and multinational security ties and networks in the region; Intensify mixed patrols at Nigeria's borders to curtail the movement of armed groups and criminals; Share and exchange intelligence information on a more regular basis; Support programs at all levels of government that address poverty ,_,  youth unemployment and women's lack of empowerment; Encourage and support the federal government to genuinely implement a national policy of zero tolerance for corruption; Encourage the federal government to work with northern political ,_,  traditional and religious elites toward a political solution to the Boko Haram problem ._. 
 ._.  Nigeria Ranks High On Global Deaths FromInsurgency ._. 
Jonathan's Committee Opens Secret TalksWith Sect LeadersA week after 21 suspected members of Boko Haram sect were killed during a foiled jailbreak attempt at the headquarters of the Department of State Security DSS in Abuja ,_,  nobody has come forward to claim their remains ,_,  Sunday Trust investigation has revealed ._. The inmates had attempted to escape from detention last Sunday when ,_,  according to the DSS ,_,  one of them attacked a guard and seized his weapon ,_,  resulting in hours of shootout that left 21 detainees dead and two security agents injured ._. The situation was brought under control when soldiers from the Guards Brigade intervened and cordoned off the area ._. Bodies of the suspected Boko Haram members were later deposited at the mortuary of the National Hospital in Abuja by the personnel of the security service ._. The DSS did not ,_,  however ,_,  disclose the identities of the inmates ,_,  provide details as to the time and places of their arrest or their respective positions in the hierarchy of the terrorist group ._. When our reporters visited the hospital on Friday ,_,  officials disclosed that the remains were being kept in the morgue under the instruction of the security operatives ._. One of the officials who did not give his names also said that no relations or acquaintance of any of the killed suspects had come forward to either identify the remains or claim them for burial ._. Nobody has requested to see the corpses or asked to be allowed to collect any of them since the security agents dropped them here ,_,  the staff who works at the hospital's mortuary said ._. Another official said the identities of the bodies were not disclosed to the hospital ,_,  adding there is no record in the hospital to show who they are or what their names are ._. He said alphabets were attached to each of the bodies ,_,  as they were brought to the hospital ,_,  adding that only the DSS knew what the letters stood for ._. When contacted ,_,  the hospital's spokesperson ,_,  Dr Tayo Haastrup ,_,  said the hospital had no information on any of the dead suspects ._. 
All we know about them is not different from what Marilyn Oga has told the media ,_,  he said ,_,  referring to DSS spokeswoman ._. Meanwhile ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan's 7 -_: man secret committee ,_,  which is charged with the task of renewing talks with Boko Haram sect has opened dialogue with leaders of the group ,_,  Sunday Trust can reveal ._. The 7 -_: man committee ,_,  which is headed by the Minister of Special Duties ,_,  Barrister Kabiru Turaki ,_,  is made up of five members of the previous Presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North ,_,  one member of a Civil Society Organisation and a top army personnel ._. While setting up the committee ,_,  named President's Committee on Continuous Dialogue and Resolution Challenges in North ,_,  Jonathan gave them a five -_: point agenda ,_,  including :_:  -_:  To continue from where the previous committee stopped in its task and particularly engage any group that may be ready for dialogue; -_:  To develop ,_,  together with relevant agencies of government ,_,  a frame -_: work for the granting of amnesty; -_:  To develop and implement ,_,  together with relevant agencies of government ,_,  the frame -_: work for disarmament; and -_:  To develop ,_,  with the relevant agencies of government ,_,  a comprehensive victims support programme and strategies for its implementation to further the development of strategies and mechanisms to address the underlining causes of insurgencies to prevent reoccurrence ._. Sunday Trust learnt last night that already the committee has established links with leaders of the Boko Haram sect in several states ,_,  and some of them have expressed willingness to work with the committee ._. The committee is re -_: establishing links with leaders of Boko Haram in Bauchi ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  Katsina ,_,  Kano ,_,  Sokoto ,_,  who ,_,  during the previous dialogue had expressed the willingness to assist in resolving the conflict ._. 
Those that the committee are in talks with are not in detention; they are living in various parts of the North ._. 
Previously they had told the committee that it was possible to work out disarmament with members of the sect in various cells ._. 
They are quite willing ,_,  and in the last two weeks ,_,  the new committee members have linked up with them ,_,  a source told Sunday Trust ._. Our reporter learnt further that under the new atmosphere ,_,  government was prepared to provide funds for the repair of churches ,_,  mosques and homes which were destroyed during the insurgency ,_,  so as to bring relief to many other victims who are still alive ._. In a previous interview with Sunday Trust ,_,  Barrister Turaki claimed that the presidential committee made a tremendous breakthrough ,_,  for which government should build upon ._. He had said ,_,  Our greatest achievements are one ,_,  we were able to establish links with the insurgents ,_,  both the Jama'at Ahl -_: as Sunnah lid -_: da'wah wal -_: Jihad Boko Haram and the Ansaru sects ._. 
We've been able to change their thinking and position about dialogue ._. 
We've been able to make them realise that despite whatever differences they may have with government ,_,  arising from whatever situation or circumstance ,_,  that dialogue is inevitable ,_,  especially regarding their position as Muslims ._. Two ,_,  we've been able to supply them strong verses from the Holy Quran ,_,  not only the views expressed by and contained in the Hadith and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW ,_,  but also the views of great Islamic scholars ._. 
And three ,_,  that we were able to get them to agree to talk to us at all is a great achievement ._. 
Establishing links with them is one thing ,_,  but to be able to get them to come out and talk with us is ,_,  perhaps ,_,  the committee's greatest achievement ._. Beyond that ,_,  we've been able to build confidence ._. 
When we started ,_,  members of the sects were skeptical ,_,  suspicious actually ,_,  of the intentions of government and those of the committee ._. 
For us to make them overcome those suspicions and win their confidence was no mean feat ._. 
Despite the fact that they had tremendous respect for individual members of the committee ,_,  they were still suspicious of them coming together as a committee constituted by government ._. 
So for us ,_,  to be able to win their confidence was a rare achievement ._. The committee had while submitting its report to President Jonathan on November 5 ,_,  2013 recommended ,_,  among others ,_,  the setting up of an advisory committee on continuous dialogue ._. It also recommended the setting up of Victims Support Fund for casualties of insurgency to be administered by a new agency established specifically to assist the victims ._.

Boko Haram is both a serious challenge and manifestation of more profound threats to Nigeria's security ._. 
Unless the federal and state governments ,_,  and the region ,_,  develop and implement comprehensive plans to tackle not only insecurity but also the injustices that drive much of the troubles ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  or groups like it ,_,  will continue to destabilise large parts of the country ._. 
Yet ,_,  the government's response is largely military ,_,  and political will to do more than that appears entirely lacking ._.   -_:  International Crisis Group ,_,  April 3 ,_,  2014The advice from international agencies and partners ,_,  as well as from Nigerian civil society ,_,  is consistent ._. 
A primarily military approach to the very real threat from Boko Haram in the northeast will not work ,_,  and in fact ,_,  will only produce more human rights abuses and fuel the conflict ._. 
Nevertheless ,_,  there seem to be no signs of a change in de facto government policy ._. 
And Nigeria's major partners ,_,  such as the United States ,_,  have given decidedly mixed signals on the issue ,_,  with an official designation of Boko Haram as terrorist last November ,_,  and news that the U ._. S ._.  will be supplying additional training to Nigerian forces see links below ._. Unlike other conflicts in Africa ,_,  in which the United Nations ,_,  the African Union ,_,  and others play major roles ,_,  with the potential for greater accountability ,_,  the outcomes in Nigeria depend primarily on internal debates within Nigeria ,_,  in which hard -_: liners seem to have the effective upper hand ._. Nonetheless ,_,  the evidence is clear that the policies are promoting insecurity rather than security ._. 
This AfricaFocus Bulletin contains excerpts from two reports released in the last two weeks on the issue ,_,  one from Amnesty International and the other from the International Crisis Group ._. Of related interest :_: Background on debate about terrorist designation names Nigeria's Boko Haram and Ansaru 'terrorists' military aids Nigeria on Boko Haram :_:  New special ops units expected to benefit from Pentagon training and equipment ,_,  Christian Science Monitor ,_,  January 23 ,_,  2014  -_:  previous AfricaFocus Bulletins on Nigeria ,_,  visit most recent on the conflict in the northeast is at previous AfricaFocus Bulletins on peace and conflict issues ,_,  visit  -_:  Editor's NoteNigeria :_:  More than 1 ,_, 500 killed in armed conflict in north -_: eastern Nigeria in early 2014Amnesty International 44/004/2014March 31 ,_,  2014IntroductionSince the start of 2014 ,_,  more than 1 ,_, 500 people have been killed in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._. 
People are living in a climate of fear and insecurity ,_,  vulnerable to attack from Islamist armed group Boko Haram on the one hand and facing human rights violations at the hands of the very state security forces which should be protecting them ._. 
In light of this context ,_,  the ongoing intensity of the confrontation and the organisation of the clashing actors ,_,  Amnesty International considers the situation to be a non -_: international armed conflict ._. According to Amnesty International's research at least half of the deaths are civilians ,_,  killed in attacks by Boko Haram ._. 
More than 600 people ,_,  mainly former detainees ,_,  were killed by the security forces following the attack by Boko Haram on the military barracks in Maiduguri on 14 March ._. 
These killings amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes ._. Amnesty International is extremely concerned that Nigerian security forces and the Islamist armed group Boko Haram are committing serious violations of International Humanitarian Law IHL and human rights abuses amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity ._. 
There have been hundreds of unlawful killings ,_,  including scores of extrajudicial executions ,_,  and deliberate attacks on civilians ._. 
Thousands of detainees have been victims of torture and other cruel ,_,  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ._. Suspected Boko Haram members have launched a campaign of violence on the residents of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe states ._. 
A state of emergency was declared by President Goodluck Jonathan in these three states in May 2013 and was extended in November 2013 ._. The extension of the state of emergency has not helped to reduce the violence in northern Nigeria ._. 
Hundreds of people are dead ,_,  thousands of families have been separated and hundreds of thousands of people have fled the affected states and are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries or have been internally displaced ._. 
National and international humanitarian organisations have faced serious difficulties in reaching out to people in some parts of the affected region ._. 
As a result ,_,  thousands do not have access to emergency medical care and food supplies ._. 
Women ,_,  the elderly and children have been mostly affected ._. Since the violence started in 2009 ,_,  thousands of fighters have also been killed in clashes between security forces and Boko Haram members across different locations in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._. 
Since 2012 ,_,  thousands of people have died in military custody in Borno and Yobe states ._. 
Hundreds more have been victims of enforced disappearances and thousands have been subjected to acts of torture and other forms of cruel ,_,  inhuman and degrading treatment in military and police custody in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._. Amnesty International is calling on regional and international human rights bodies to step up in ensuring that thorough ,_,  independent ,_,  impartial and transparent investigations are conducted ._. 
Nigeria should seek international assistance and advice in the conduct of these investigations and any subsequent prosecutions ._. Recent Attacks and Unlawful Killings by Boko HaramSince the beginning of 2014 ,_,  attacks by suspected Boko Haram members have intensified ,_,  resulting in the deaths of more than 700 people ,_,  mainly civilians not directly participating in hostilities ._. 
Boko Haram has embarked on a campaign of widespread violence and human rights abuses ,_,  resulting in a general atmosphere of intimidation and fear among the population in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._. 
They have claimed responsibility for the majority of attacks in the north -_: east ._. 
As far as Amnesty International is able to ascertain ,_,  no other group or individuals have claimed responsibility for the attacks ._. 
However ,_,  it is possible that other groups or individuals have also carried out some of these attacks ._. On 3 March suspected Boko Haram members attacked Jakana Village in the Konduga Local Government Area of Borno State ._. 
They killed between 40 and 48 civilians ,_,  and destroyed shops and the police station ._.   ._. On 25 February ,_,  suspected Boko Haram members attacked a college in Yobe State ,_,  killing between 43 and 59 students and teachers ._. 
Several survivors and local residents told Amnesty International that the gunmen spent four hours in the school compound killing people and burning nearby houses and school buildings ._. 
They described how gunmen arrived around 9 :_: 00pm and started shooting indiscriminately ,_,  killing every male they found ._. 
Children who hid in a classroom were burned alive ._. 
Survivors and some eye witnesses told Amnesty International it took several hours before the army responded ._. In an interview with Amnesty International ,_,  one of the staff at the school said :_:  When the gunmen entered the school compound ,_,  there was confusion ._. 
Everybody was running for safety ._. 
I and many students ran into the bush ._. 
Many of the children did not return after the attack ._. 
We don't know what has happened to them ._. 
When I returned ,_,  my quarters had already been burned ._. 
As we speak ,_,  I'm staying with a relative ._. 
I don't know what to do ._. 
I am fed up ._. On Tuesday 11 February ,_,  suspected Boko Haram members killed more than 50 people and burnt scores of homes in the village of Konduga ,_,  also in Borno state ._. 
Two eyewitnesses in Konduga village told Amnesty International that between 30 to 40 girls were abducted and taken away by the gunmen during the attack on a government -_: run secondary school in the village ._. 
The Chief Nursing Officer of the General Hospital in Konduga was also reportedly kidnapped by the gunmen ._. Similar attacks have taken place in villages in Adamawa and Yobe states ,_,  leaving scores dead ,_,  injured and forcibly displaced ._. Nigeria's Security Forces Commit Human Rights Violations with ImpunityNigeria's security forces continue to commit serious human rights violations in their response to Boko Haram ._. 
Since 2009 ,_,  thousands of people suspected of having links to Boko Haram have been extrajudicially executed or unlawfully killed by the Nigerian army and police ._. 
Hundreds more have been victims of enforced disappearances and since 2012 ,_,  thousands of suspects died in military and police custody ._. The JTF frequently conducts raids usually following attacks by Boko Haram in which ordinary people are arrested en masse and detained in military detention centres for lengthy periods ,_,  often without charge or trial and without access to their families and lawyers ._. In 2014 ,_,  as attacks by Boko Haram intensified ,_,  the military has responded by stepping up its operations against Boko Haram camps in Borno state ._. 
In the first three months of the year ,_,  over 400 suspected Boko Haram members were killed in JTF raids and in firefights during Boko Haram attacks on towns ._. 
38 civilians have also allegedly been killed by the military this year ._. 
In addition ,_,  at least 150 detainees died in military custody ._. Hundreds Unlawfully Killed by the Nigerian Security Forces on 14 March 2014On Friday 14 March ,_,  at 7 am Boko Haram members attacked the Giwa barracks in Maiduguri ,_,  Borno state and opened the cells to release the more than 1 ,_, 000 detainees ,_,  who were arrested under suspicion of being members or sympathisers of Boko Haram ._. 
A video released by Boko Haram shows gunmen entering the Giwa military barracks ,_,  setting ablaze scores of vehicles in the compound ,_,  before releasing hundreds of people ,_,  including women ,_,  children ._. 
Many of those released looked frail and were barefooted ._. Eyewitnesses told Amnesty International that the attackers came from a nearby village and crossed the Yedzaram River ._. One resident in Mairi ,_,  Mallam Ibrahim1 described what he saw during the attack :_:  On Friday morning around 7 to 7 :_: 30 in the morning ,_,  I heard gunshots ._. 
I came out to the back of my house and saw gunmen running towards the barracks ._. 
I live close to the barracks ._. 
We were all scared ._. 
We knew the day is going to be very bad for all of us ._. 
We stayed indoors with my family ._. 
The gunshots continued non -_: stop ._. 
It took about an hour before we heard the fighter jet ._. A few minutes later ,_,  we saw lots of people coming towards our house from the barracks ._. 
Many of them look hungry ,_,  barefooted and were asking for water ._. 
Some did not even have full clothes on ._. 
We came out and started helping them ._. 
We gave them water and some fruits ._. 
We later took them to a classroom in the University of Maiduguri ._. 
They were 56 in total ._. 
They told us they are all detainees from Giwa ,_,  added Ibrahim ._. Mallam Ibrahim and one other resident in Mairi told Amnesty International that ,_,  less than an hour after the detainees left the barracks ,_,  two Hilux trucks filled with government soldiers came to the scene where the 56 former detainees were gathered ._. 
Mallam Ibrahim said :_:  The soldiers asked all of us to leave the area ._. 
The former detainees were all in the classroom ._. 
They started screaming 'we are not Boko Haram ._. 
We are detainees !_. ' I and my other neighbours saw the soldiers take the former detainees to a nearby place called 'no man's land ,_, ' behind the University of Maiduguri ._. 
We stood there and watched while the soldiers opened fire and killed the 56 people we had just given fruits and water ._. 
They were shot and killed in front of us ._. 
All of them ._. 
Just like that ._.  report continues with more details of killings by the security forces in the wake of the attack  ._. According to reports received from eyewitnesses ,_,  family members ,_,  lawyers and community activists ,_,  at least 622 people were killed by the security forces on 14 March ._. 
The actual number could even be higher ._. Humanitarian Crisis and Impact of the Conflict on Civilian PopulationThe ongoing fighting between Boko Haram and the Nigerian security forces has had damaging impact on the lives of millions of people across north -_: east Nigeria ._. 
The humanitarian situation in the region has reached unprecedented levels ._. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries and thousands more have been made internally displaced ._. 
According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees UNHCR  ._.  the crisis in north -_: eastern Nigeria ,_,  exacerbated by the declaration of the state of emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States on 14 May 2013 extended for six months on 12 November 2013 ,_,  more than 520 ,_, 000 people ,_,  mainly women ,_,  children and elderly people have been forced to flee inside Nigeria or seek refuge in neighbouring countries Niger ,_,  Cameroon and Chad ._. On Tuesday 26 March 2014 ,_,  the Director -_: General of the Nigerian National Emergency Management Agency NEMA said more than 250 ,_, 000 people have been displaced as a result of the fighting in northeastern Nigeria ._. Nigerian Government's Failures to Address ImpunityAmnesty International has repeatedly urged the authorities to conduct thorough and independent investigations into the alleged human rights violations and abuses with a view to bringing suspected perpetrators to justice in a fair trial ._. Over the years ,_,  both State and Federal government have established inquiries into acts of violence including communal and sectarian violence in Nigeria's middlebelt ,_,  unlawful killings ,_,  poor conditions in detentions and other instances of violations and abuses ,_,  but their findings and recommendations have mostly not been made public ._. 
Criminal investigations have been inadequate ,_,  with serious doubts over the quality of evidence against those arrested ._. In 2013 ,_,  the committee set up by President Goodluck Jonathan to investigate and explore options for bringing an end to the on -_: going fighting in northern Nigeria submitted its report to the Presidency ._. 
The findings of the Committee's report have not been made public ._. Following previous incidents of political ,_,  communal and sectarian violence ,_,  scores of people were rounded up by the police and security forces but few have been successfully prosecuted ._. According to information received by Amnesty International ,_,  previous commissions of inquiry into allegations of human rights abuses have named suspected perpetrators ,_,  yet very few people are aware of the content of these reports ._. 
In many cases ,_,  no criminal investigation is initiated on suspected perpetrators ._. 
Victims of violence have not received redress or reparation ,_,  including compensation ,_,  leaving people destitute and further stoking feelings of resentment and desperation ._. 
Victims and their families have a right to know the truth about the abuse of their rights including the identities of individuals or groups responsible for carrying out or ordering violations ._. As such ,_,  Amnesty International is urging the international community ,_,  in collaboration with credible national civil society organisations and the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria ,_,  to set up an independent and international commission of enquiry with a mandate to investigate grave human rights abuses and violations that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._. Curbing Violence in Nigeria II :_:  The Boko Haram InsurgencyInternational Crisis Group3 Apr 2014 / direct URL :_:  Summary and RecommendationsBoko Haram's four -_: year -_: old insurgency has pitted neighbour against neighbour ,_,  cost more than 4 ,_, 000 lives ,_,  displaced close to half a million ,_,  destroyed hundreds of schools and government buildings and devastated an already ravaged economy in the North East ,_,  one of Nigeria's poorest regions ._. 
It overstretches federal security services ,_,  with no end in sight ,_,  spills over to other parts of the north and risks reaching Niger and Cameroon ,_,  weak countries poorly equipped to combat a radical Islamist armed group tapping into real governance ,_,  corruption ,_,  impunity and underdevelopment grievances shared by most people in the region ._. Boko Haram is both a serious challenge and manifestation of more profound threats to Nigeria's security ._. 
Yet ,_,  the government's response is largely military ,_,  and political will to do more than that appears entirely lacking ._. Most Nigerians are poorer today than they were at independence in 1960 ,_,  victims of the resource curse and rampant ,_,  entrenched corruption ._. 
Agriculture ,_,  once the economy's mainstay ,_,  is struggling ._. 
In many parts of the country ,_,  the government is unable to provide security ,_,  good roads ,_,  water ,_,  health ,_,  reliable power and education ._. 
The situation is particularly dire in the far north ._. 
Frustration and alienation drive many to join self -_: help ethnic ,_,  religious ,_,  community or civic groups ,_,  some of which are hostile to the state ._. 
It is in this environment that the group called Boko Haram usually translated loosely as Western education is forbidden by outsiders emerged ._. 
It is an Islamic sect that believes corrupt ,_,  false Muslims control northern Nigeria ._. 
The group and fellow travellers want to remedy this by establishing an Islamic state in the north with strict adherence to Sharia Islamic law ._. Boko Haram's early leader ,_,  the charismatic preacher Mohammed Yusuf ,_,  tried to do so non -_: violently ._.   ._. Yusuf subsequently became increasingly critical of the government and official corruption ,_,  his popularity soared ,_,  and the group expanded into other states ,_,  including Bauchi ,_,  Yobe and Kano ._.   ._. A series of clashes between Boko Haram members and police escalated into an armed insurrection in 2009 ._. 
Troops crushed the rebellion ,_,  killing hundreds of followers and destroying the group's principal mosque ._. 
Yusuf was captured ,_,  handed over to the police and shortly thereafter extrajudicially executed ._. Boko Haram went underground and a year later launched attacks on police officers ,_,  police stations and military barracks ,_,  explicitly in revenge for the killings of Yusuf and his comrades ._. 
Its spokesman demanded prosecution of those responsible ,_,  release of their detained colleagues ,_,  restoration of the mosque and compensation for sect members killed by troops ._. 
Since 2010 ,_,  the group's campaign has grown ,_,  targeting not only security forces ,_,  government officials and politicians ,_,  but also Christians ,_,  critical Muslim clerics ,_,  traditional leaders ,_,  the UN presence ,_,  bars and schools ._. 
Lately it has evolved into pure terrorism ,_,  with targeting of students attending secular state schools ,_,  health workers involved in polio vaccination campaigns and villages supporting the government ._. In May 2013 ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan declared an emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa states and deployed additional troops that with the help of vigilantes drove Boko Haram from most cities and towns ._. 
He also established a committee to negotiate a settlement with its leadership ,_,  with little success ._. 
On 18 March 2014 ,_,  National Security Advisor Mohammed Sambo Dasuki announced a soft approach to addressing the root causes of terrorism ,_,  but it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented ._. RecommendationsTo ensure greater human security in northern Nigeria ,_,  better protection from Boko Haram attacks and a more law -_: abiding ,_,  better resourced ,_,  professional security serviceTo Nigeria's Federal Government :_: 1 ._. 
Discontinue heavy -_: handed military and police methods that risk pushing yet more restless ,_,  jobless and frustrated youths into violence and extremism ._. 2 ._.

Encourage the federal government to work with northern political ,_,  traditional and religious elites toward a political solution to the Boko Haram problem ._. 
To switch from a mainly military approach to the challenge from Boko Haram ,_,  and radicalism in general ,_,  to one more attuned to root causesTo Nigeria's Federal Government :_: 8 ._. 
Recognise that unless issues of bad governance and systemic corruption are addressed vigorously and transparently ,_,  all other measures will be nothing but stop -_: gaps ._. 9 ._. 
Free up the necessary national resources to address sustained economic hardship ,_,  rising inequality and social frustration by expanding and strengthening the anti -_: corruption agencies ,_,  and ensure they work effectively at state and local levels ,_,  free of political manipulation ._. 10 ._. 
Begin to tackle the root causes of growing radical Islamic and ethnic militancy by fully developing and implementing a Far North Development Commission ,_,  similar to the Niger Delta Development Commission ,_,  with a mandate that includes coordinating antidesertification campaigns ,_,  developing large -_: scale irrigation ,_,  agriculture ,_,  power and road projects and promoting small businesses that could create jobs for youths; and do so in a transparent ,_,  consultative and accountable manner ._. 11 ._. 
Take steps to change the climate of secrecy and fear around radical Islam by encouraging greater public discussion on the causes of and ways to address radicalism ._. 12 ._. 
Accredit senior ambassadors and defence attach�s to all neighbouring countries and meet with them frequently to review the domestic and transnational security situations ._. 
To state governments in the north :_: 13 ._. 
Reform the Quranic educational system by introducing a dual curriculum as in Kano and paying teachers' salaries so as to relieve pupils of the need to beg for their upkeep ._. 14 ._. 
Use the Northern Governors' Forum to set high standards of transparent and accountable state governance ._. 
To Nigeria's international partners :_: 15 ._.

Encourage and support the federal government to genuinely implement a national policy of zero tolerance for corruption ._. 
If the abduction of two Italian priests and a Canadian nun is confirmed to have been conducted by Boko Haram ,_,  it will be the Islamist militants' third kidnapping in northern Cameroon ._. At approximately 2 am on the morning of 5 April ,_,  two Italian priests and a Canadian nun were abducted from their residence in northern Cameroon ._. 
The incident occurred in Tchere ,_,  a settlement located in Cameroon's Far North Region which shares a border with Nigeria ._. While there have been no immediate claims of responsibility for the abduction ,_,  suspicion has fallen on the Nigerian -_: based Islamist militant group Boko Haram ,_,  which is believed to have established an operational presence in the region ._. 
If confirmed ,_,  the latest kidnapping would mark the third abduction of foreign nationals by Boko Haram in northern Cameroon ._. In the first such incident ,_,  the militant group kidnapped a French family from the town of Dabanga on 19 February 2013 ._. 
Boko Haram's shadowy leader ,_,  Abubakar Shekau ,_,  claimed responsibility for the abduction and demanded that the Cameroonian government release all detained group members in exchange for the French hostages ._. The family of seven was released unharmed in April 2013 amid speculation that France had paid a ransom of $3 million ,_,  though the exact circumstances surrounding the release remain unclear ._. Boko Haram's second kidnapping in Cameroon occurred on 13 November 2013 ,_,  when suspected group members abducted French priest ,_,  Georges Vandenbeusch ,_,  from the Far North Cameroonian town of Koza ._. A few days after the incident ,_,  Boko Haram confirmed its involvement in the kidnapping in a statement provided to the Agence France -_: Presse ._. 
Vandenbeusch was eventually released unharmed a month after his capture amid claims that French authorities had again paid a cash ransom to the group ._. Both France and Boko Haram denied that a ransom was paid ,_,  however ,_,  with the Islamists claiming that the priest was freed by Shekau on compassionate grounds ._. 
But this account was in turn denied by a Cameroon military source who said that Vandenbeusch was exchanged for a senior Boko Haram commander who had been detained by Cameroonian authorities ._. Abductions in NigeriaWhile these foreign kidnappings in Cameroon were the first to be claimed by Boko Haram ,_,  they were preceded by similar abductions in neighboring Nigeria ._. On 12 May 2011 ,_,  British national ,_,  Chris McManus ,_,  and his Italian compatriot ,_,  Franco Lamolinara were abducted from their residence in the northern Nigeria city of Birnin Kebbi ._. 
The victims ,_,  who were engineers of the B ._. 
Stabilini construction company ,_,  were executed by their captors on March 2012 in the city of Sokoto following a failed rescue attempt by Nigerian and British Special Forces ._. Their abduction ,_,  which the British Foreign Office linked to Boko Haram ,_,  marked the first kidnapping of foreigners in Nigeria at the hands of Islamist militants ._. Less than eight months later ,_,  German engineer Edgar Fritz Raupach became the second foreigner to be kidnapped by the Islamist insurgents when he was seized in the northern city of Kano ._. 
Similarly to Lamolinara and McManaus ,_,  Raupach was executed during a failed rescue attempt in May 2012 ._. Although al -_: Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb AQIM claimed Raupach's abduction ,_,  analysts such as Martin Ewi from South Africa's Institute for Security Studies ISS claimed that Boko Haram facilitated the kidnapping in return for training they had received from AQIM in Mali ._. Although Boko Haram was already engaging in kidnapping ,_,  the threat to foreign expatriates was arguably only truly realised on 19 December 2012 when Ansaru ,_,  a group believed to be a breakaway faction of Boko Haram ,_,  orchestrated one of the most daring and well -_: executed kidnapping operations seen in northern Nigeria ._. In the attack ,_,  dozens of its militants seized French engineer ,_,  Francis Colump ,_,  from a guarded compound in the town of Rimi ,_,  located in Nigeria's Katsina state ._. Less than 24 hours after the abduction ,_,  Ansaru claimed responsibility for the kidnapping which it said was retaliation for France banning women from wearing a full -_: face veil in public and the French government's planned intervention in against Islamists in northern Mali ._. On 19 February 2013 ,_,  the group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of seven further foreign expatriate workers ,_,  employed by the Lebanese -_: owned Setraco construction company ,_,  in the Jama'are local government area in Bauchi State ._. On 10 March 2013 ,_,  the group released a video claiming that it had executed the hostages in response to a government attempt to free the hostages ._. Operational changeIn recent years ,_,  Nigeria -_: based armed groups have gained notoriety for the kidnapping foreign expatriates ._. 
The tactic was previously employed by Nigerian militants operating in the country's southern Niger Delta as a means of soliciting both socio -_: economic concessions from the Nigerian government and ransom payments from multinational firms operating within the oil -_: rich region ._. The relative success of these groups further served to encourage criminal networks ,_,  which have also abducted foreign expatriates within and outside the country's borders ._. However ,_,  the use of kidnapping as an operational tactic by Nigerian Islamists is a development that has a much wider -_: reaching impact than merely scaring off would -_: be tourists or stymieing foreign investment ._. With the Nigerian government already struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency which may be expanding outside its borders ,_,  the use of kidnapping will only further complicate counterinsurgency initiatives ._. Ransom payments will likely be used to purchase more weaponry and/or recruit more fighters ,_,  while hostage exchanges will also result in the likes of Boko Haram and Ansaru reclaiming high level members and subsequently strengthening their operational capabilities ._. Moreover ,_,  the recent increase of foreign kidnappings in northern Nigeria and neighbouring Cameroon may itself be indicative of an operational evolution of Nigerian -_: based Islamist militant groups ._. To date ,_,  the tactic has been employed with great efficacy by various al -_: Qaeda -_: linked groups who have kidnapped foreign nationals in the likes of Algeria ,_,  Mali and Mauritania ._. In a declassified report issued by the British government in 2013 ,_,  it was estimated that at least $70 million in ransom payments had been paid to Islamist kidnappers since 2009 and that al -_: Qaeda's North African branch had received an estimated $45 million ._. Nevertheless ,_,  in accordance with the high pay -_: offs ,_,  the kidnapping of foreign nationals remains a high -_: risk undertaking subject to various logistical and operational challenges ._. In this regard ,_,  the fact that Nigerian Islamists have been able to execute such abductions with a relative degree of success speaks volumes of their own operational capabilities ._. Perhaps even more disconcertingly ,_,  the use of kidnapping as an operational tactic by Boko Haram and Ansaru could serve as the most credible evidence of some form of connection or cooperation between these groups and wider al -_: Qaeda -_: linked networks ._.

The United States of America ,_,  USA and Britain ,_,  yesterday ,_,  condemned the bomb attack on a packed bus station in Abuja and called for a full investigation ._. British Foreign Secretary ,_,  Mr William Hague ,_,  who condemned the bomb attack ,_,  in a statement in Abuja ,_,  said :_:  I was deeply saddened to hear of the bomb explosion in the east of Abuja ._. 
I unreservedly condemn those responsible and hope they are swiftly brought to justice ._. 
I offer the British government's deepest condolences to the bereaved and those who have suffered injury ._. The UK foreign secretary reiterated that Britain would continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to help tackle the threat from terrorism ._. Also ,_,  State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters :_:  We are outraged by this senseless act of violence against innocent civilians ,_,  as she condemned the series of attacks on three villages in Borno State over the weekend ._. We continue to stand with the Nigerian government and people as they grapple with violent extremism ,_,  she added ._. Washington was working with the Nigerian government and its neighbours to address the growing threat of Boko Haram in a comprehensive manner ,_,  Psaki said ,_,  but warned it was too early to say the attack had been carried out by Boko Haram ._. The United States designated Nigeria's radical Islamist Boko Haram network and an offshoot known as Ansaru as terror groups in November ,_,  bowing to months of pressure to act ._. 
The recent bomb attack in a bus terminal at Nyanya ,_,  a bustling outskirts of Abuja ,_,  by a suicide bomber suspected to be a Boko Haram terrorist or sympathizer ,_,  was one too many ._. Perhaps more than any of the previous attacks by the sect ,_,  the Nyanya incident ,_,  which targeted people hustling to get to work in the city of Abuja ,_,  aroused a collective sense of sorrow and outrage ._. 
Estimates of the dead and injured vary  -_:  depending on whom you want to believe ._. 
What appears obvious is that anywhere between 75 and 130 people lost their lives in that mayhem ,_,  with some 150 -_: 200 others sustaining various degrees of injury ._. 
Properties and means of livelihood lost in the carnage are yet to be estimated ._. 
The psychological trauma induced by the incident will live with many of the residents of Nyanya and beyond for a long time ._. Barely 24 hours after the Nyanya attack ,_,  came another report that some unidentified gunmen suspected to be members of the terrorist organization ,_,  abducted more than 100 female students from a Government Girls Secondary School at Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State  -_:  the epicentre of the Boko Haram challenge ._. 
Reports of deaths in Bornu state have become a daily staple such that for many ,_,  those deaths ,_,  reported daily in the media ,_,  no longer shock or awe them  -_:  a classical indication of the 'normalization' or routinization of evil ._. Our challenge as a nation is to refuse to allow such impunities to be 'normalized' by the frequency of their occurrences or the longevity of their existence ._. 
Retaining a sense of outrage against such impunities is the strongest statement that they are unacceptable and cannot be 'normalized' like other acts of impunity in the country ._. But why will otherwise 'normal' people derive sadistic joy in the mass murder of people who have done them no wrongThe German -_: American political theorist Hannah Arendt tells us that the great evils in history are not executed by fanatics or sociopaths but rather by ordinary people who accepted the premises of their actions and therefore participated in them on the grounds that those heinous actions were normal ._. 
She used this to explain why evil deeds tend to be everywhere in a society ._. 
She called this the 'banality of evil' ._. 
For her ,_,  those engaged in barbarous acts such as the Boko Haram terrorists accepted the premises of their actions as just  -_:  even if the rest of the society thinks otherwise ._. 
Acts of impunity against innocent Nigerians unfortunately reflects the federal  -_:  violent armed robberies across the entire country ,_,  kidnapping especially in the South -_: east and south -_: south ,_,  turf war by militarized cults and gangs in Bayelsa State ,_,  ritual murders everywhere ,_,  senseless intra and inter communal 'warfare' across several parts of the country and of course terrorism couched in religious revivalist rhetoric in parts of the North ._. Despite the 'banality of evil' or the 'normalization of the unthinkable' ,_,  in several parts of the country ,_,  there are reasons why the impunity purveyed by Boko Haram and groups acting in its name ,_,  or sympathetic to its cause ,_,  pose a special threat to the country :_: One ,_,  though impunity couched in religious revivalism has been an integral part of the conflicts in Nigeria ,_,  especially in Northern Nigeria ,_,  Boko Haram and Ansaru were the first drivers of conflicts in the country to be declared terrorist organizations by the United States and the United Kingdom ._. 
Two ,_,  both are also the first purveyors of violence in the country to be strongly linked to international terrorist networks ,_,  essentially Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb AQIM and possibly the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa ,_,  MOJWA ,_,  -_:  also known as Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa MUJWA ._. 
MUJA was formed in 2011 allegedly because of the marginalization of Black Africans in AQIM ._. Three ,_,  Boko Haram was also the first group to introduce suicide bombing in Nigeria ._. 
Use of suicide bombers had been unknown in West Africa because suicide is regarded as cultural anathema  -_:  until two high -_: profile attacks in Abuja  -_:  the June 2011 police headquarters bombing and the August 2011 United Nations headquarters bombing ._. 
Since then ,_,  suicide bombing has become part of the tools in the arsenal of the two groups ._. 
Four ,_,  the two terrorist groups were also probably the first purveyors of impunity in Nigeria with both international and domestic territorial ambitions ._. 
For instance while in 2011 ,_,  Boko Haram's terrorism was largely confined to Nigeria's northeast by the end of last year 2013 ,_,  Boko Haram -_:  driven attacks occurred in most of the 19 States in the North ,_,  including the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja ._. 
Boko Haram suspects have also been arrested in Lagos ._. 
The group was equally linked to the kidnapping of the French Catholic priest ,_,  Georges Vandenbeusch ,_,  in Cameroun in November 2013 and to another kidnapping of a French family in the same area of Cameroun in February 2013 ._. 
Flowing from the territorial ambitions of the two groups ,_,  the conflicts they trigger have wider national implications and by virtue of their links to international terrorist networks ,_,  also wider international implications than the traditional conflicts that the country is used to ._. Fighting the new terrorism has been problematic not only because of their methods but also because of disagreements on why such a group came about ._. 
The conspiracy theories that seek to explain the phenomenon tap into the fears that are edged in our traditional fault lines :_: There are several conspiracy theories about Boko Haram ._. 
One ,_,  which is popular among commentators from the Southern part of the country ,_,  is that the sect is sponsored by key Northern politicians to make the country 'ungovernable' for President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  a Christian from the minority Ijaw ethnic group ._. 
One of the weaknesses of this 'theory' is that much of the mayhem carried out by the sect has been in the North and against Northern Muslims ._. 
It is in fact difficult to see the nexus between destabilizing governance in some Northern states and making the country 'ungovernable' for the Jonathan administration ._. 
But there are several who believe in such ,_,  making it difficult to mobilize that sense of collective outrage needed to tackle the menace ._. 
Obviously there are certain local grievances that revivalist movements tap into but that must not be confused with deliberate sponsorship ._. Another conspiracy theory is that Boko Haram is actually being sponsored by the Jonathan administration to make Islam look bad or give the impression that the North was out to pull it down as a way of mobilizing the support of his 'Southern brethren' and Christians behind his administration ._. 
A variant of this is that Boko Haram is actually sponsored by the government to weaken or destroy the North ._. 
Those who believe in any of the variants of this conspiracy 'theory' ,_,  essentially people from the North ,_,  point out that during the Abacha days ,_,  the government deliberately bombed some places and then blamed it on NADECO ,_,  which was campaigning for the re -_: validation of the June 12 election won by Abiola but annulled by the military regime of Ibrahim Babangida ._. 
This variant of the conspiracy 'theory' therefore believes that the Jonathan administration is borrowing a leaf from the Abacha regime ._. One of the weaknesses of this theory however is that nothing in the confessions of some of the arrested Boko Haram members supports any of these conspiracy theories ._. 
Also it defies logic why a President should set part of his domain on fire ,_,  especially where one cannot determine the direction of such conflagration  -_:  just to weaken a particular religion or part of the countryWhile there are a number of other efforts at scholarly explanations of the reasons for the emergence and subsequent radicalization of the sect ,_,  I have always believed that a more comprehensive explanation will be to see the sect as a reflection of the crisis in our nation -_: building processes ._. 
The crisis in our nation -_: building conflates with the crisis of underdevelopment to create an existentialist crisis for many Nigerians ._. 
Therefore for many young people ,_,  a way of resolving the consequent sense of alienation is to retreat from the Nigeria project and construct meanings in chosen primordial identities  -_:  often with the Nigerian state as the enemy ._. 
This must not be confused with supporting or condoning Boko Haram and its ways but the need for us to dig deeper ,_,  including finding the local grievances that they tap into ._. 
We will need to fight both the symptom of the problem and the root cause simultaneously ._. Fighting terrorism is never easy or straight forward anywhere in the world ._. 
Victory can hardly come easily or quickly ._. 
Often the challenge is to contain the group such that the society can continue to function normally despite the episodic impunities they purvey  -_:  the way the society has learnt to live with other impunities carried out intermittently by other groups ._. 
The key challenge we have with Boko Haram is that the mayhem by the group is not only spreading across the country ,_,  but also becoming 'routinized' ._. 
And while this is happening ,_,  politicians are playing silly blame games while their foot soldiers complicate matters with their absurd conspiracy theories ._. 
Nigeria is not winning in the battle against Boko Haram ,_,  but neither are the Islamist militants ._. 
The Abuja bombing is more a sign of the group's decline than ascendency ._. At approximately 06 :_: 45 on the morning of 14 April ,_,  an explosion ripped through the Nyanya Motor Park in the bustling city of Abuja ._. 
The blast ,_,  which triggered secondary explosions as nearby vehicles were engulfed in flames ,_,  occurred as scores of commuters were readying themselves for their daily commute into the centre of the Nigerian capital ._. 
By the time the smoke had settled and the sounds of screams were displaced by those of sirens ,_,  in excess of 70 people had been killed and scores others wounded in the deadliest attack of this nature to ever occur in the city ._. While there have been no immediate claims of responsibility ,_,  suspicion has fallen on the Islamist militant group Boko Haram ._. 
Since its formation in 2002 ,_,  Boko Haram has waged an armed insurgency against the Nigerian government which has left an estimated 5 ,_, 000 people dead and thousands more displaced ._. 
According to Amnesty International ,_,  1 ,_, 500 of these deaths have occurred since the beginning of 2014 ,_,  marking a recent upsurge in attacks both in frequency and brutality ._. 
Reports of civilian massacres attributed to Boko Haram have become a near daily occurrence in Nigeria's north -_: east which has long served as the group's operational stronghold ._. The increase in violence has many believing that the Nigerian government is losing the battle against Boko Haram ._. 
Moreover ,_,  incidents such as the 14 April attack in Abuja raise concerns that the Islamist group could be expanding its campaign to areas outside its traditional areas of operation ,_,  potentially placing major cities at sustained risk ._. In assessing the credence of such concerns ,_,  however ,_,  it should be noted that the attack at the Nyanya Motor Park was not the first Boko Haram attack in Abuja ._. 
On 16 June 2011 ,_,  a suicide bomber breached the perimeter of Nigeria's police headquarters Louis Edet house in what was likely an attempt to assassinate then Inspector -_: General of Police ,_,  Hafiz Ringim ._. 
In a telephone interview conducted with a Nigerian newspaper ,_,  Boko Haram spokesman Abu Zaid claimed responsibility for the attack which killed one police officer and left several others wounded ._. Two months later ,_,  Boko Haram then executed one of the most high -_: profile attacks in its decade -_: long insurgency when another suicide bomber drove his explosive -_: laden vehicle into the entrance of a building in Abuja's Garki district housing the offices of the United Nations ._. 
At least 21 people were killed and 76 wounded in the attack which Boko Haram claimed was a reprisal for security operations targeting its members in the northern city of Kano ._. Boko Haram's attacks in Abuja continued in 2012 when the group claimed responsibility for the 26 April bombing of the offices of the ThisDay news media publications and when its suspected offshoot ,_,  Ansaru ,_,  launched a daring raid on a prison facility in Abuja's Apo district where a number of Boko Haram insurgents were being detained ._. The aforementioned incidents highlighted that Boko Haram possessed both the intent and operational capacity to execute attacks in Abuja which ,_,  while perhaps not as deadly ,_,  were more sophisticated in both their operational planning and execution in comparison to the recent Nyanaya Motor Park bombing ._. But if Boko Haram had the requisite capabilities to execute attacks in Abuja with relative frequency ,_,  why has there been a near two -_: year lull in its operations in the capital The answer lies in the fact that despite mainstream narratives suggesting the contrary ,_,  counterinsurgency measures employed by the Nigerian government have indeed weakened the group ._. Boko Haram's attacks in contextSince a multi -_: pronged counteroffensive was launched against Boko Haram's positions and interests in early 2013 ,_,  there has been a marked decline in the group's attacks outside Nigeria's north -_: east ._. 
Prior to the aforementioned offensive ,_,  Boko Haram was rapidly expanding its operational footprint across Nigeria ,_,  permeating both the north -_: western and central administrative regions of the country ._. 
In addition to attacking Abuja with a degree of frequency ,_,  Boko Haram was also particularly active in Kano ,_,  Kaduna and Plateau states and had even conducted operations as far south as Kogi state ._. By the end of 2012 ,_,  a major Boko Haram attack in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos ,_,  which had so far been spared ,_,  seemed inevitable ._. 
However ,_,  the group's rapid expansion was abruptly halted in May 2013 following the implementation of a state of emergency in the north -_: eastern states of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe ,_,  which have and continue to be worst affected by the insurgency ._. 
The emergency decree ,_,  which provided the military with additional powers in combating the militants ,_,  was soon followed up with sustained air and ground offensives which the Nigerian military claims killed hundreds of Boko Haram members and destroyed key bases in the Sambisa Forest region of Borno state ._. In the months following the May 2013 offensive ,_,  Boko Haram restricted their operations to Nigeria's north -_: east ._. 
Apart from the reduction in the geographical scope of its attacks ,_,  there was also a shift in the group's modus operandi ._. 
Attacks utilising suicide bombers declined ,_,  while armed attacks targeting fortified facilities such as police stations ,_,  military barracks and detention centres similarly became less frequent ._. 
Instead ,_,  Boko Haram shifted its focus to soft civilian targets ,_,  launching attacks on vulnerable and isolated towns ,_,  villages and schools ,_,  which often had a minimal or non -_: existent security presence ._. A group which had been touted as being better equipped and trained than the Nigerian military ,_,  and which had exhibited this superiority in brazen and sophisticated attacks against hardened targets ,_,  was now waging a more conventional and risk adverse form of guerrilla warfare ._. 
Although high -_: profile attacks have not ceased in their entirety ,_,  as witnessed by the December 2013 attack at the Borno Air Force base and the more recent assault on the Giwa barracks ,_,  these incidents have been sporadic and mostly limited to the city of Maiduguri where Boko Haram has always maintained a strong operational presence ._. While spiralling casualty figures show that the Nigerian army is certainly not winning the battle against Boko Haram ,_,  it would be wrong to suggest that Boko Haram is exactly winning either ._. 
Although tragic and brutal attacks continue relentlessly ,_,  the tactics employed by the Nigerian army have ,_,  at the very least ,_,  stymied the Boko Haram's geographical expansion and curtailed its ability to execute attacks against targets of strategic security and/or governmental importance ._. In this regard ,_,  we should be careful when drawing conclusions about the 14 April attack at Abuja's Nyanya Motor Park ._. 
If Boko Haram was indeed responsible ,_,  it is unlikely that the incident marks the beginning of any sustained campaign by the militants in Nigeria's capital ,_,  or indeed anywhere else outside the country's north -_: east ._. 
Instead ,_,  the attack could be seen more of a reflection of a militant group aware of its operational decline yet which is still intent on posturing itself as a threat of national proportions ._.

Some developments in the continuing saga of uncontained terror visited on Nigeria by the Boko Haram terrorists are becoming frightening ._. 
They indeed need to be carefully evaluated as their implication may call for a better apprehension of our predicament ,_,  and thus the ordering of a more adequate responsibility in our conduct ._. One has often wondered ,_,  to begin with ,_,  how correct is the term insurgency ,_,  as applied to the situation in the Northern parts of the country ._. 
My dictionary identifies that description more with riot ,_,  uprising or a situation which involves an upheaval among the people of an area within one another ._. It becomes a civil war when it implicates the entire populace while ,_,  on the other hand ,_,  it is war ,_,  plain and simple ,_,  if it is an attack inflicted by other elements though comprising some of the natives themselves ._. The latter is what seems to be happening ,_,  although it might have taken off originally among the natives of a certain section of the country ._. 
But there is a lot of evidence that the motivating spirit and personalities are foreign to this country ._. For one thing ,_,  it is most unlikely that the enormous amount of money required for the arms and the funds demanded by the logistics ,_,  are generated within Nigeria ._. 
The source of these expenses should have been on the front burner in the efforts to combat this evil force right from the beginning as it was suggested by many people on many occasions ,_,  but the idea did not appear to catch the fancy of those in charge of the investigations immediately ,_,  or it should not have taken so long before we hear anything positive in that direction ._. It is all the same disturbing ,_,  very disturbing ,_,  to learn that some strongholds of the Boko Haram are being refurbished with supplies by helicopter ._. 
It is a deposition that is mind boggling ._. 
In fact ,_,  one might have credited such a statement to a deranged person had it not been made by personalities that could never be associated with a lunatic proposition ._. The leader of the group is no other than a former Chief of Air Staff ,_,  Air Vice Marshall AI -_: Amin Dagash Retd ._. 
The revelation was made at a press conference in Abuja early this week ,_,  at which were also present a former Minister of Finance ,_, Mallam Adamu Ciroma; a former Secretary to the Federal Government ,_,  Ambassador Babagana Kingibe;Shetima Mustapha ,_,  an elder statesman ,_,  and other political figures and opinion makers in Bornu and Yobe States ._. 
They were grouped under the identity of the Political Elders Forum from the two States which are both in the centre of the Boko Haram storm ._. 
But they were not just belching out hot air because ,_,  as very knowledgeable and directly affected citizens ,_,  they asked a few worrying questions ,_,  like :_: ltem :_: How were the insurgents able to attack the Maiduguri Air Force Base and demobilise as well as burn planes and other military installations despite existing state of emergency and curfew existing in the townItem :_:  How could 20 to 30 Toyota Hillux vehicles move in a convoy freely with subsisting curfew and still go undetectedItem :_:  How did a little band of rag -_: tag misguided youths metamorphose into a well -_: kitted ,_,  well -_: armed killing machine ,_,  moving freely in convoys of vehicles and supported by helicoptersItem :_:  How did the Shilka Tank ,_, a multi -_: purpose ,_,  self -_: propelled anti -_: aircraft artillery weapon positioned to secure Giwa Barracks ,_, fail to function ,_, resulting in heavy loss of lives of both civilian and military as widely reported in the mediaItem :_: Are the authorities unaware of helicopters dropping arms and ammunition ,_,  food and medical supplies to area well known to be stronghold of the insurgentsItem :_:  Are we dealing with fifth columnists in this crisisWell ,_,  what can we say Major -_: General Chris Olukolade ,_,  the Defence spokesman ,_,  has warned -_:  -_: threatened -_:  -_: to make anyone pay dearly for making statements that are considered untoward to the military war effort ._. 
None of the rhetorical questions above could be said to be complimentary to the total effort against the Boko Haram ._. 
But the calibre of the speakers promptly dismisse any misgivings about their motives ._. 
They are genuinely patriotic ,_,  more so since they are in the heat of the situation ._. 
If this is war ,_,  not a mere insurrection as we have frequently pointed out on this page ,_,  have we really got our act togetherOther aspects of this crisis indeed give cause for anxiety with regard to its conduct ,_,  and that is without prejudice to our appreciation of the gallantry and bravery of the armed forces ._. 
There appears to be lack of direction in support of what is a single purpose ,_,  that is ,_,  the eradication of the Boko Haram menace ._. 
In relation to this ,_,  we may ask ,_,  should the President of our nation be engaging openly in a nauseating blame game with State Governors over who is responsible for the mess we are inIt is time we stopped searching for a peg on which to hang the dilemma of the predicament in which we have found ourselves ._. 
It would be a time -_: consuming and profitless enterprise ._. 
The cause may have sociological or economic roots ,_,  as many have suggested ._. 
It may be because of our evident neglect of planning a good future for our youth ._. 
It may be all of that and more ,_,  or a combination of other factors ._. 
But the question now is how do we put this horror behind us without creating others in its placeA good approach would be to dismiss distractions ._. 
Okay ,_,  I know it has been said before ,_,  but it will bear repeating ._. 
Nothing will be said here from now on about the staging of the preposterous show titled ,_,  The National Conference ._. It would be merely adding to the preposterousness of the mirthless comedy ._. 
Now that so many of our eminent men and women are already on the gravy train ,_,  we shall just have to wait until the bread wagon rolls to a stop ._. 
In the meantime ,_,  it may be very difficult not to ask some of these questions ._. 
And here is the last one for now :_:  Is the issue of the Boko Haram considered inimical to the unity and progress of the nation enough to for it to be an item on the agenda of the National Conferencedis na we kontryThe discovery was made in Soka off the Lagos -_: lbadan Expressway ._. 
An enclave of unmitigated dreadfulness established for the sole purpose of slaughtering human beings and dismembering the cadavers for sale ,_,  had apparently been functioning there for an appreciable period ._. The unfortunate victims were kidnapped ,_,  sometimes cruelly tortured and then ruthlessly disposed of ,_,  while the hapless relatives pined for their return in vain ._. 
Investigation ,_,  to employ a new cliche in the market ,_,  is on -_: going ._. When one has recovered from the shock of the story ,_,  and that takes a while ,_,  the truth then gradually sets in :_: we are in Nigeria ._. Look ,_,  a newly -_: married man cannot operate his little fan because there was no electricity supply ,_,  like the rest us ,_,  in his house ._. 
However ,_,  he has a generator ,_,  like many of us these days ._. 
But fuel is hard to find except on the black ._. 
How for do So he gets five litres for one hundred -_: and -_: twenty naira per litre and goes home to his honey ._. 
They put on the generator ,_,  switch on the fan and everything is fine  -_:  -_:  except that the gen is in an enclosure at the back of the house and the fumes have no means of escaping ._. Neither does the young man who sleeps on into the arms of untimely death with his pregnant wife and a younger relation ._. 
In Port Harcourt where it happened ,_,  they will tell you ,_,  That na Naija ,_, fara !_. 
Soko ,_,  an off -_: shoot of Nigeria's busiest highway ,_,  on the outskirts of one of Africa's largest cities ,_,  is the scene of one of the most barbaric human butchery imaginable ._. 
That is Nigeria for you ._. And what would anyone want with the dismembered parts of a human corpse As if you did not know ._. 
Affluence ,_,  of course !_. 
Juju or black magic that is reputed to be capable of procuring immense wealth ,_,  and business or other forms of successes in a variety of endeavours ._. 
Don't ask me if it works ._. 
Just look around Soka and you would know that you are in the middle of a booming factory of skulls ,_,  and limbs ,_,  and genitals -_:  -_: the dismembered carcases tell it all ._. If it did not work ,_,  there would not be so much patronage ._. 
There should therefore be no high hopes for finding out more about this inhuman criminal enterprise since investigations find progress a challenging ordeal in the face of affluence and influence ._. 
May God rest the souls of all who have been banished from life through this route ._. 
Who knows how many others remain undiscovered ._. 
This is our country ,_,  Nigeria ._. Timeout ._. 
Cuthbert DubePosition :_:  Booted out PSMAS CEOStated Salary :_:  US$530 000What has he done while earning that salary :_: Under Dube's tenure Premier Service Medical Aid Society expanded its portfolio to create PMSI which saw the giant society acquire many properties around the country and offer its own medical services ,_,  from the basic to specialist care ._. But somewhere along the line ,_,  he seems to have lost the plot as he started concentrating on his soccer administration role at the expense and detriment of PSMAS ._. By the time of his removal ,_,  many of the society's clients were unhappy with the service they were receiving ._. 
Those who were not lucky enough to be near a PSMI service provider risked being turned away by the service providers who were owed almost $50 million by PSMAS ._.

He is said to have lost the use of his lower limbs which was restored by the prophet's healing ._. Perhaps due to the deliverance or to the overriding health problems ,_,  those in the know say the man who used to be a partaker of fine liquor is now a teetotaller ._. The bar at his former office at PSMAS headquarters along George Silundika is said to have felt that conversion as all alcohol immediately disappeared from the scene ._. But he is said to be still a very good friend to some high -_: ups who have been presented with bottles of the best ._.

The free -_: to -_: air decoder merchants also capitalised on the gap before Botswana spoiled the soup by getting the SABC channels pulled off the airwaves ._. Local productions suffered a sea of death as independent producers were not getting any returns for their efforts ._. 
The local drama industry that did so well before Mr Muchechetere was at the helm has given way to Nigerian productions which have lowered our standards of English to unprecedented depths ._. Wheels :_: Courtesy of our licence fees and other state broadcaster resources ,_,  Mr Muchechetere glides along in the comfy leather interior of a Mercedes Benz S350 BlueTEC series ,_,  which would set one back for around $90 000 ._. Apart from that he also owns a Peugeot 405 ,_,  Hino Truck ,_,  black Jeep Cherokee and a white Isuzu twin cab truck ._. Residence :_: Mr Muchechetere moved up in life when he vacated his old residence at 16 Castens Avenue in Belvedere to number 5 Bargate Road in Vainona where he has a spacious yard ._. His house is all elegance with straight lines and a graceful harmony with the greenery that surrounds it ._. 
A thatched gazebo is presumably the entertainment arena that the public broadcaster put up for him ._. Personal Style :_: This gentleman tries to go for the classic gentleman's look but does not quite pull it off ._. 
As for the short -_: sleeved suit that he spotted for his court appearance ,_,  the best that can be said about it was that maybe he was trying to anticipate the prison garb he would have had to don if bail had been denied ._. 
His clothes look quite expensive but rarely do they suit as they ought to ._. Interesting tidbits :_: Those in the know say the gentleman came from a humble background but has evolved into a connoisseur of the finest tastes in life ._. Mr Muchechetere is known for an almost militaristic kind of leadership with subordinates seemingly afraid rather than respectful of him ._. 
His arrogance is well -_: known and typified in the speech he gave those who queried why they should pay ZBC licences yet they listen to or watch other channels ._.

From the perception that it was the executive's brand of choice ,_,  Netone has tumbled to the operator that is only favoured by people who have no choice of networks in the sticks ._. Wheels :_:  He owns several cars including a 4MATIC Mercedes Benz 350 CDI worth not less than US$100 000 ._. Residence :_:  This gentleman is domiciled in Borrowdale ._. 
To be his neighbour you need at least half a million for a basic structure ._.

This is all usually pulled together with leather black shoes ._. Interesting tidbits :_:  The gentleman is reputedly a hygiene freak who will not drink from a glass even in the up market restaurants ._. 
He is said to prefer the offerings of his own table ._. 
Obviously the thought of all the pathogen -_: ridden lips that may have kissed the rim of the glass makes him shudder ._. 
So he only uses disposable tumblers or drinks straight from the manufacturer's package using a straw ._. It is the same fear of disease that presumably makes the man use tissue to operate elevator buttons ,_,  open doors and otherwise protect himself from coming into contact with any other surface that is touched by the hoi polloi ._. A reliable source says that the CEO of Netone has been known to openly show his displeasure at the disgusting habits of male subordinates who exit the boy's room without washing their hands after a visit to the urinary ._.

Meanwhile the authority is busy making some questionable and ill -_: advised investments with our contributions ._. These include the Beitbridge hotel ,_,  a medical centre that has become a white elephant and millions poured into financial ventures ._.

We wish he was equally conservative in his investment choices with our money which we give him out of our meager salaries each month ._. Interesting tidbits :_:  Mr Matiza is said to be quiet and reserved with his personal life a book safely ensconced behind high mansion walls and a marked absence on the usual social scenes for his peers ._. 
In his professional capacity ,_,  he is said to be a very just and fair boss who is adamant that he will not chew our pension contributions alone ._. Whenever any deal is approved for him ,_,  the whole team from management to the lowest sweeper will get what are deemed their dues ._.

Another Harare woman Zuva Damson successfully instituted maintenance claims against him ._. Just recently Gwindi forked out a cool $6 000 fine without breaking a sweat to satisfy the conditions of the judgment that was handed to him for misconduct and bringing the game of football into disrepute following public utterances he made in Bulawayo last year ._. He allegedly denigrated Zifa ,_,  former Warriors coach Klaus Dieter Pagels and condemned Delta Beverages' sponsorship package of the Premier Soccer League ._. He also paid a $3 000 appeal fee and then paid $5000 to run against Cuthbert Dube in the Zifa elections ._.

Opening with Exit Ideological Soludo ,_,  Welcome Pragmatic Sanusi ThisDay ,_,  Thursday ,_,  Wednesday July 22 ,_,  2009 pg 46 ,_,  I had written newspapers articles at different stages of the Nigerian Central Bank governorship tenure of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi SLS ,_,  a Kano Prince and Dan Majen Kano ._. 
He became Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria CBN on June 3 ,_,  2009 ._. 
Unlike his accomplished predecessor in office Professor Chukwuma Soludo ,_,  and unlike a typical Nigerian elite ,_,  Sanusi had reportedly since 2011 indicated his desire for just a single term of four years as governor ._. 
My articles on Sanusi and the Central Bank of Nigeria included -_:  The CBN Banking/Economic Elixir 2009 ,_,  Doctrine of Necessity And Nigerian Economy 2010 ,_,  Graveyard Economics 2011 ,_,  Sanusi And CBN At Mid -_: Term 2012 and Nigeria's Political Economy And National Conference 2013 ._. 
In the preceding Chukwuma Soludo tenure ,_,  I had contributed such newspaper articles as -_:  On The Suspended New Naira Policy 2007 ,_,  Financing Nigeria's Economic Development for Vision 2020 2007 ,_,  Inflation Targeting :_:  Time For Soludo To Taste Unemployment 2008 ,_,  Issues On The Economy ,_,  CBN And Other Matters 2008 ,_,  Governor Soludo And High Interest Rate :_:  Fallacy of Comparison 2008 ,_,  Halting Nigeria's Drift Into Neo -_: Liberal Black Hole 2008 ,_,  Production ,_,  Growth Targeting For Now 2008 and Economic Crisis :_:  The Printing Press Option 2009 ._. Thus ,_,  I had diligently observed and regularly commented on the Central Bank particularly over seven years 2007  -_:  2014 ,_,  while my engagement with the Nigerian Economy in published and unpublished articles and books occurred over some three decades 1985  -_:  2014 with such books as Nigeria :_:  Solutions To Our Economic Megacrisis Economics Applied To Problem -_: Solving In Developing Nations 1985 ,_,  A Giant In Renaissance The Saga of A Land of Milk And Honey 1989 and Planting Ideas Selected Interventions In Nigerian Political Economy 1985  -_:  2005 published in 2006 ._. As an academic mind and economist ,_,  I always acknowledged and appreciated and lauded Soludo's brilliance as an economist in my many newspapers articles ,_,  but I also profoundly disagreed with his neo -_: liberal economic outlook and world view ,_,  and his absolute failure to financially empower the real sector of the Nigerian economy for growth in production even after he and CBN very commendably consolidated the deposit money banks DMBs with increased capitalisation of the banks to twenty -_: five billion naira N25billion each in 2004  ._. 
Rather than financially empowering the real sector ,_,  the consolidated banks under the nose of Soludo's CBN detoured to granting excessive margin loans to players in the Nigerian stock market and also poured loans into the oil and gas sector for refined fuel importation ._. 
Invariably ,_,  the global financial crisis from 2008 ,_,  with epicenter in the United States Of America ,_,  ravaged the Nigerian Stock Market ,_,  the oil and gas sector and the Nigerian banks inevitably ran into hot water with massive and crippling non -_: performing loans NPL ._. 
The Nigerian financial system and economy was sorely threatened despite the face -_: saving or panic -_: calming denials of the CBN Governor Soludo ._. 
It was in this very worrisome and economically unstable milieu in our nation that President Umaru Yar'Adua appointed Sanusi Lamido Sanusi as Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria on June 3rd 2009 ._. Sanusi and The Gathering Storm As already stated ,_,  Governor Sanusi came to office in the midst of a threatening and clearly incipient grave damage to the entire financial system with several deposit money banks in jeopardy and the capital market already economically poisonous and proving lethal and life threatening to several stock market shareholders ,_,  stock brokers and stock -_: broking firms ._. 
The stock market capitalisation had collapsed from N13tn$104billion in 2007 to N6 ._. 6trillion$53bllion by end 2008 ._. 
The situation was grim and dire and compared to the onset of the Great Depression during the tenure of President Herbert Hoover of United States when the New York stock market crashed precipitously on black Thursday ,_,  October 24 ,_,  1929 ._. 
The virtual collapse of the United States economy thus proceeded in the Great Depression ._. Roosevelt and the Great Depression Like Professor Soludo was guided out of CBN governorship after President Yar'Adua openly complained and deplored the apparent misinformation by Soludo and CBN that the Nigerian economy was insulated from the global economic meltdown from 2008 ,_,  and he got Sanusi Lamido Sanusi brought in as CBN Governor from his position as Managing Director and Chief Executive of prestigious First Bank Plc ,_,  so also was Republican President Herbert Hoover shown the door in the presidential election in 1932 and Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt FDR elected President of the United States amidst the ravaging Great Depression ._. 
Interestingly ,_,  inspite of my reservations ,_,  my name was submitted from the office of the National Security Adviser as an economist for consideration for the CBN governorship position a few years into the expiration of Soludo's tenure ._. 
As already lucidly described in my published books ,_,  FDR ,_,  the polio victim American President ,_,  in very inspired spit -_: fire emergency actions approached the economic nightmare of the Americans with the mindset that There is nothing to fear but fear itself ._. 
Within hundred days he initiated the New Deal programme which massively overhauled the laissez -_: faire free enterprise economy of Herbert Hoover and brought in immense government intervention to redeem the United States economy that had frighteningly gone flat on its back ._. If FDR had not so intervened market capitalism in United States of America ,_,  and perhaps globally ,_,  would have been imperiled and could have totally collapsed ,_,  and the prognostications of revolutionary Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 'The Communist Manifesto' 1848 and Karl Marx in 'Das Kapital' or Capital :_:  A Critique of Political Economy 1867 of the demise of capitalism might have been fulfilled ._. 
From a quarter of the labour force or up to thirteen million people losing their jobs ,_,  five thousands banks closing with loss of nine million savings accounts and national income Gross Domestic Product GDP virtually halved from $104 ._. 4billion in 1929 to $56billion by 1933 in current prices ,_,  FDR by 1936 had put more than six million unemployed Americans back to work ,_,  extended government assistance to private banks to reopen closed banks and with national income recovering up to 50% higher in 1936 $82billion than in 1933 $56billion in current prices ._. 
FDR redemptive and recovery economic policies over a decade restored the American economy by 1939/1941 such that GDP in current prices of $104 ._. 4billion in 1929 was clearly restored to $90billion in 1939 and $125billion in 1941 ._. 
It is significant that President Roosevelt in 1935 introduced the social security system in United States of America ._. 
FDR is well accorded the prestige and legacy as one of United States of America's best presidents ._. 
Indeed ,_,  he is the only United States president to have been elected to office for three tenures 1932 ,_,  1936 and 1940 ._. Obama and the Great Recession Barrack Obama's presidential odyssey is currently on -_: going and running in his second and constitutionally final term ._. 
It is far more recent than FDR's ,_,  but both are economically redemptive ._. 
It is common knowledge that Obama assumed office in 2009 in the whirlwind of the 2008 financial upheaval ,_,  the seed of which the Reaganite/Thatcherite free wheeling neo -_: liberal capitalism had planted decades back ._. 
This discredited fundamentalist brand of capitalism ignorantly subsumed dedicated regulation of the economy and absolutely ignored the inherent greed of homo sapiens ._. 
Regrettably ,_,  the Nobel Laurel Milton Friedman ,_,  icon of the Chicago School of Economic thought ,_,  intellectually spawned this faux pax which the Washington Consensus through the IMF and World Bank foisted on the global economy ._. 
President George Bush ,_,  typically of United States Republicans and seemingly cloning Herbert Hoover of Great Depression fame or infamy ,_,  and the otherwise revered Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ,_,  an icon ,_,  both rode on and glorified the ill -_: fated neo -_: liberal wave that eventually resulted in the worst economic downtown of the American economy since the Great Depression ._. 
Though the collapse of Little Rock in Great Britain in 2007 was the earliest signal of incipient financial crisis ,_,  it was the very inexplicable and costly failure and negligence of the Federal Reserve under Ben Bernanke to bail out investment bank Lehman Brothers by late September 2008 that sent shock waves through Wall Street and contagiously into Western Europe and globally ._. The sub -_: prime mortgage misadventure in the United States violently shook the United States financial system to its foundation ,_,  and got viral infecting the global economy till 2010/2011 ._. 
The United States government and Federal Reserve and indeed the global economy inevitably paid a much bigger price for the cumulative presidential ideological fundamentalism and the inexplicable negligence of the United State Federal Reserve Bank ._. 
It took double edge action to normalize the destructive ravages emanating from neo -_: liberalism in governance ,_,  the abdication of regulation by regulators and Federal Reserve incompetence ._. 
President Obama and the United States Congress  ,_, with no option left for the United States to exit the sub -_: prime mortgage crisis ,_,  moved very rapidly like Franklin Delano Roosevelt had done with the New Deal and offered well over $700billion bail out fund to AIG the failed insurance giant ,_,  the banking and mortgage industry ,_,  home owners ,_,  automobile industry and even States Governments to save the United States economy from a chaotic collapse ._. 
The Federal Reserve under Ben Bernanke injected trillions of dollars into the United States economy and introduced multi -_: layered ,_,  dovetailing reductions in interest rate approaching zero level interest rate ._. 
President Obama in re -_: nominating Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve Chairman commented thus Ben approached a financial system on the verge of collapse with calm and wisdom with bold action and out -_: of -_: the box thinking that has helped put the brakes on our economic freefall Obama Renominates Bernanke BusinessDay ,_,  Wednesday August 26 ,_,  2009 ,_,  pg 2 ._. 
The immense monetary stimulus of the Federal Reserve is currently in the process of gradual winding down under the new Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen ._. Sanusi CBN and The Great Recession It is obvious that Sanusi's Central Bank of Nigeria had been more perceptive ad proactive and had acted faster than Ben Bernanke in nipping in the bud an incipient financial and real sector and economic meltdown in Nigeria ._. 
By a master stroke of Sanusi's CBN and with requisite lightening speed ,_,  collapsing and badly managed banks were promptly rescued and recapitalized while the mal -_: functioning and culpable bank Chief executives and their management were sacked very daringly and prosecuted with jail terms ,_,  assets forfeiture and confiscation as deterrents ._. 
I have a written several articles on Sanusi's tenure at CBN ._. 
In my article  -_:  Graveyard Economics ThisDay ,_, Thursday August 25 ,_,  2011 pg 41 & 43 I had indicated Sanusi's indisputable legacy as CBN governor thus The CBN under Sanusi Lamido Sanusi in my well considered opinion has been doing everything possible to engineer increased production in the economy particularly by its out -_: of -_: the box thinking and financially empowering the manufacturing sector ,_,  power sector ,_,  aviation and agriculture through a N500billion intervention ._. 
The CBN has ,_,  so to say ,_,  been forced by our economic circumstances to move outside the narrow limits of price stability in the economy to actually financially empower sectors that can ensure price stability and economic growth ._. 
This is apart from the fact that Sanusi's CBN stabilized the banking system and saved our economy from collapse in the 2008/2010 Great Recession ._. 
Just as in the United States where President Barack Obama and Federal Reserve under Ben Bernanke halted the deterioration of the Great Recession into a depression ,_,  CBN under Sanusi Lamido and protectively supported by President Yar'Adua and later President Jonathan aborted the chaos that threatened to engulf our banking system and ultimately the economy ._. 
The paradox is that neither the American people nor the Nigerian people adequately appreciate how much they were saved from economic gloom ,_,  doom and Armageddon ._. Whatever might now be regarded as Sanusi Lamido Sanusi's foibles and human failings and indiscretion ,_,  it is indisputable that he cooperatively with ,_,  and under the Presidential protective shields of Yar'Adua and Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  and with the support of CBN staff ,_,  saved the Nigerian economy from destruction when it really mattered during 2008/2010 ,_,  much the same way that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt did for the United States of America in the Great Depression of 1929/1932 ,_,  and President Barack Obama did in the Great Recession of 2008/2010 ._. 
Obviously ,_,  with every humility but justifiable pride ,_,  Sanusi in Nigerian economic history will always remain in the good company of two of America's greatest Presidents ._. 
But FDR got elected thrice as President and Obama is running the constitutional second term ,_,  may be here in our much -_: blessed country and giant of Africa ,_,  the reward for patriotism is Sanusi being targeted ,_,  harassed and called a bad name ,_,  and the CBN as an institution being demystified and diminished perhaps ._. 
Every right thinking Nigerian ,_,  for whom patriotism matters ,_,  knows that this need not be so ._. 
Welcome the next CBN Governor ,_,  Mr ._. 
Godwin Emefiele ,_,  Managing Director of Zenith Bank Plc who will have the ball in his court and who expectedly will certainly not fail to keep the CBN flying loftily ._. Dr ._.  Omole ,_,  is a Consultant ,_,  Author & Economist and writes from Lagos ._. 
Walter Drenth ,_,  the Marketing Director of Nigeria Breweries Plc ._.  spoke to Raheem Akingbolu on developments in the beer market and the rationale behind the repackaging of Legend ,_,  a stout brand from the stable of the company ._. The recent development in the beer market shows that the industry is not growing as it should ,_,  there seems to be a little slide in terms of demand ._. 
What is your take on thisI don't think the beer market is not growing; the beer market in terms of lager and stout is still growing a little bit ._. 
Though ,_,  I admit that it's less than before but it is still growing ._. 
Again ,_,  the micro economic indicators in Nigeria show that there is a slow economic performance ,_,  which must have probably affected the beer market ._. 
However ,_,  all things been equal ,_,  the beer market is still growing ._. 
Even though ,_,  not as expected ,_,  we are optimistic that it will pick up by second half of the year ._. If I get you right ,_,  this can be attributed to the slow economic performance in NigeriaI think overall ,_,  it is the flow of income into the economy which enables an average consumer to have access to what he or she wants ._. 
So ,_,  there is a relationship in between which could be direct or indirect ._. Are you cutting down your production because of thisNo !_. 
We are not cutting down production rather we will continue to re -_: invent to bring excitement to the market and contribute our quota to Nigerian economic development ._. What has this development got to do with the bottom line of your businessRather than talking about bottom line now ,_,  I suggest stakeholders get the report from our Annual General Meeting ,_,  which was held yesterday ,_,  our General Manager delivered a paper on performance which was comprehensive about our activities in the year under review ._. 
For those who attended the AGM ,_,  it was an avenue to get adequate information on performance ._. What informed the idea of the re -_: launch of LegendBasically there were two things :_:  change and innovation ._. 
Here in Nigeria Breweries ,_,  change and innovation are important to our success ._. 
Also ,_,  our consumers are open to change and often ask for it ._. 
In line with this philosophy ,_,  innovation is part of legend's growth strategy and we showcase this through the re -_: launch ,_,  which everybody cherished ._. 
Now ,_,  from the brand perspective ,_,  because this brand is quite exciting ,_,  the thinking behind the revolution was done to take our consumers through a journey in change ._. 
We conceived an idea that would give them something better and something they will never forget in a hurry ._. So that is from the brand perspective ,_,  we want to move forward ,_,  we want to improve on how to serve our consumers better ._. 
The second angle is from the consumers' insight ,_,  we try to talk to our consumers and know what they want and how they could easily adapt to change ._. 
We are also interested in protecting the brand to ensure that our consumers always get the authentic legend ._. 
Now ,_,  looking at the physical appearance ,_,  the colour inside is the original colour of legend stout which we know ,_,  and that is why we choose to give it a metallic labeling in order to stand out in the industry ._. Some times last year ,_,  a close rival of the brand does something similar ,_,  could this be a respond to competitionI don't think we are responding to any competition ,_,  as stated earlier ,_,  innovation is our driven plan for legend ._. 
A quick flash back about our support for Legend in the last few years will convince all that rather than responding to others ,_,  other players are following out footsteps ._. 
This explains why the brand has ,_,  in the past years remained the fastest growing stout in the market ._. 
We have to keep growing; we want to give consumers the best by emphasising the quality of our brand ._. 
This is part of our strategies ._. 
And again ,_,  I want to reiterate this; it's part of our ways of showcasing a premium quality ._. Let me take you back to the play at the blackrealvolution event ._. 
The Legend brand did not mince words about its desire to take over the stout market in Nigeria ._. 
How realistic is this goalTo answer this ,_,  I think I should first touch on the campaigns that were put together to support the brand ._. 
Our television and radio campaigns come from the personality of the legend brand; it's an authentic brand ,_,  a young and courageous brand ._. 
And again ,_,  the real personality of legend is all about delivering the values that will make patrons consider the legend extra stout as second to none ._. Back to blackrealvolution ,_,  why did you have to choose this themeIt is revolution because we believe in change ,_,  the idea behind the realvolution is all about change ,_,  and we want to bring our consumers to the journey of change for the better ._. 
Meanwhile ,_,  because 'real' is the essence of legend ,_,  we must emphasise that legend is the only 'real' stout ._. 
So ,_,  it is real ,_,  it is realvolution ,_,  and black because we believe it is real with a different excitement ._. Before we did the official launching ,_,  we started a campaign ,_,  and lots of our consumer keyed into this journey with excitement ._. 
And when you look at the reveal at the launching ,_,  lots of people commended that this realvolution was actually fantastic for legend which they also appreciate the beauty of it ._. 
When you talk about the blackrealvolution ,_,  it is not far away from the real meaning of revolution ,_,  but this time around it is not revolution against the state ,_,  but a movement towards a better place to be when it comes to dark beer ._. 
In other words ,_,  the movement of the consumers from the current point where they are ,_,  to a better and a more relaxed point ._. Before now ,_,  stout use to be seen as a drink for the masculine gender ,_,  but at the official reveal of the new look of Legend ,_,  there are some elements of romance ,_,  that seems to make the brand appeals to both masculine and feminine market ._. 
Why are the promoters of the brand infusing this at this momentThis is about been real ,_,  and I think it represents a man ,_,  a brand for the real man ._. 
A guy who makes legend extra stout his choice doesn't make the choice because every other man does that ,_,  but because of what he tastes and feels about the brand ._. 
That also means he is courageous enough to make his own choice and that is what legend stands for ._. A few years ago ,_,  Legend attracted an international award  -_:  Gold Quality Award at the 51st Monde Award ceremony in Greece ._. 
What has been the impact on the brand and where should we expect the brand in the next five yearsIt's amazing; legend is growing in the market year in year out ._. 
The award was a symbol confidence and encouragement for us to do more ._. 
When you look at the quality of legend from the inside to the outside and also look at the consumer profile of the legend ,_,  you will realise that more and more people are drinking legend as the days goes by ._. 
And when you look at that and follow that logic critically ,_,  you will know how we have won the largest share of the stout market in Nigeria ,_,  and there is no doubt that the leadership of stout market is in our fingertips ._. 
In few years ,_,  we will be there ._. Can you please be specific and give number to your current market shareWe cannot reveal that ,_,  we don't reveal financial figure ._. Legend is taking 30 consumers to Dubai for its Real Deal National Consumer Promo; obviously more than last year's number ._. 
Why not prizes such as TV sets ,_,  generators and refrigerators which the brand gave out in past promosLast year ,_,  we took about twenty five people to Dubai ,_,  and this year we are increasing it to about thirty ._. 
They will have opportunity to shop free in one of the beautiful Dubai Malls ._. 
Again ,_,  this year ,_,  we have another consumers' reward initiative through which consumers would win three hundred million naira instant airtime reward ._. 
We are very sure that our consumers will appreciate all these ._. 
For us at Nigerian Breweries ,_,  we are aware of the unique position consumers occupy in brand building ,_,  reward must therefore be put in place to compensate them ._. Does the new repackaging have anything to do with price of the productIt does not have anything to do with price; the price still remains the same ,_,  so there is no price increase ._. 
It is also worthy of note ,_,  that it is exactly the same legend ._. 
Last week's court ruling on the 37 members of the House of Representatives who defected from the PDP to the APC on December 18 ,_,  2013 did not go down well with those affected ,_,  while some have advised that they should comply with the ruling ._. 
Which way to goThe court ruling delivered by Justice Adeniyi Ademola of a Federal High Court Abuja ,_,  said the 37 lawmakers who defected from the Peoples Democratic Party PDP to the All Progressives Congress APC should have no business in the House of Representaives having left the party that sponsored them to win elections to the House ._. While giving the ruling ,_,  Ademola said ,_,  Having perused the arguments of counsel and the constitutional provisions ,_,  it is clear and unambiguous that the defendants were sponsored by the PDP and won the election on its platform ._. The 12th to 53rd defendants in this suit have no business staying in the House of Representatives and ought to resign or relinquish the mandate of the 4th defendant or resign honourably ._. In view of the provision of Section 68 1g of the 1999 Constitution ,_,  the 12th to 53rd defendants cannot effect leadership change in the House ._. 
The 12th to 53rd defendants cannot lawfully vote to remove the leadership of the House ._. 
They cannot also sponsor motion to that effect ._. It is also the court's opinion that their tenure has not expired and there is no division in the PDP ._. 
The defendants are ,_,  therefore ,_,  not competent to vote or contribute to any proceedings in the House of Representatives ._. An order of perpetual injunction is ,_,  hereby ,_,  ordered ,_,  restraining them from altering or attempting to change the leadership of the House of Reps ,_,  he said ._. Penultimate Friday ,_,  a separate court had ruled that the PDP had no powers to remove the defectors from their seats and struck out the case ._. The ruling may have presented a setback for the defectors and the opposition APC ,_,  but the party and its lawmakers quickly rose to the occasion ,_,  alleging that it was a black market order and subsequently appealed the matter ._. APC caucus in the House also addressed a press conference on Tuesday in Abuja where it said the matter has been appealed ._. Minority whip ,_,  Rep Samson Osagie ,_,  who spoke on behalf of the caucus ,_,  said none of the affected lawmakers would vacate his seat as the court ruling only restrains them from making leadership change in the House ._. He said Justice Ademola went out of his mandate to grant an opinion that was never sought in the suit ,_,  which calls for a lot of concern ._. For the avoidance of doubt ,_,  let me state unequivocally on behalf of our members that the import of yesterday's Monday's ruling was that our 37 members cannot participate in the removal of Principal Officers of the House; nothing more ,_,  nothing less ._. Every other pronouncement by the Judge as to the status of our 37 members of the House were mere opinion ._. 
In any event ,_,  this judgment was given in vain and in ignorance of the House rules which governs the appointment of party leaders in the parliament ,_,  Osagie said ._. He said their initial fears and loss of confidence on the process were further confirmed when the judge after granting the reliefs sought in the suit went ahead to render an opinion on issues that were not before him nor solicited by the plaintiffs ._. For us in the APC ,_,  we were not surprised because in the course of the proceedings ,_,  the same judge had earlier issued a preservative order as soon as the arguments against his jurisdiction in the case was taken ._. 
This was our first apprehension of the commencement of the case ,_,  he said ._. The appeal letter obtained by Daily Trust read :_:  In view of the judgment/ruling of the court in the above suit delivered by Justice Ademola ,_,  on the 31st of March ,_,  2014 ,_,  our clients instructed us to proceed with an appeal ._. Consequently ,_,  we filed a Notice of Appeal dated 1st of April ,_,  2014 challenging the judgment of the court in the above suit ,_,  it said ._. The letter added that once an appeal is filed on any particular case ,_,  all matters related to the case must await the appeal judgment ._. But the question many Nigerians are asking is whether the lawmakers will based on the moral issue raised ,_,  do what the court opined ,_,  that is to resign honourably ,_,  or they will stay put to ensure the Constitution is followed to the letter ._. One of the affected members ,_,  Asita Honourable ,_,  who responded to a question on the matter said they have the right both morally and constitutionally to remain on their seats ._. There is no issue here ._. 
All that the court did was to stop any leadership change in the House ._. 
No judge has the right to say we don't have the moral or constitutional right to remain ._. 
The judge went into a matter that was never canvassed before him ._. 
In fact ,_,  I'll ask ,_,  and I'm indeed asking ,_,  that before anybody is appointed as a judge in this country ,_,  his mental capability should be tested first ,_,  said ._. Minority leader ,_,  Femi Gbajabiamila ,_,  had in the wake of the ruling described it as a strange judgment that turned law on its head ._. He said in a statement that the judgment is a product of error of court as ._. 
No person can be compelled by law to stay in an association against his or her wishes ._. He said ,_,  Section 68 was never argued in court by any of the parties ._. 
The judge gave an opinion he was never asked to give and an argument that was never canvassed before him ._. It negates a fundamental right of association of every citizen that is inalienable ._. 
Section 68 of the Constitution has been turned on its head and the error of the court is manifest ,_,  he said ._. The affected lawmakers also said the judgment would ridicule the reputation of the Nigerian judiciary ,_,  saying the judge erred in giving the order ._. Rep Ali Ahmed from Kwara State ,_,  said the judgment could not withstand an appeal ,_,  saying if such continues ,_,  there would be more turbulence in the judiciary ._. As a party to the matter ,_,  I may be partisan ._. 
But I am sure every Nigerian must be alarmed at this judgment ._. 
Of course it cannot withstand an appeal ,_,  but the issue is if trial courts continue to behave this way ,_,  I hope we should be prepared for more turbulence in the judiciary ,_,  he said ._. Another affected lawmaker ,_,  Rep Aliyu Sani Madaki APC ,_,  Kano said the judgement was delivered in bad taste to ridicule the Nigerian judiciary ._. This is what we've been saying ._. 
We've seen this even before now ._. 
It's a black market judgement that cannot obtain anywhere ._. 
It will surely ridicule the Nigerian judiciary ._. 
You can't have such a ruling when another court said last Friday that the PDP doesn't have anything to do on the matter ._. Besides ,_,  the judge went outside the prayers contained in the original suit ,_,  which shows that it is purely a black market order to favour PDP ._. 
PDP is desperate and the judges are not helping matters ._. 
This kind of judgement shouldn't have come from any learned person ._. 
We will appeal it ,_,  he said ._. Similarly ,_,  counsel to the 37 lawmakers ,_,  Mahmud Abubakar Magaji SAN ,_,  told our reporter on phone last night that the judge dabbled into another matter that was never sought in the suit ._. He said We have 30 days to appeal ,_,  but we'll do that within this week ._. 
The judge erred ._. 
In fact ,_,  it was after he gave the ruling that was never sought for that he realized what he did and quickly turned to say that the lawmakers could not effect any leadership change in the House ,_,  which was the prayer of the suit ._. However ,_,  deputy majority leader of the House ,_,  Leo Ogor ,_,  said the 37 lawmakers should not waste their resources on appeal as they have already lost the matter ._. The seats they occupy belong to PDP ._. 
It is not an individual seat but that of the party ._. 
We were more than convinced that the court will do the right thing because you do not need a rocket scientist to interpret Section 68 of the Constitution ._. My colleagues should not bother to waste their time and resources on appeal ._. 
I've always emphasised this position that you cannot reap where you did not sow ,_,  our party has demonstrated that it respects the law of the land ,_,  he said ._. As things continue to unfold ,_,  it is left to be seen if the lawmakers will follow the path of constitutionality or morality to stay put or resign as opined by the court ._. 
Abuja � President ,_,  Newspapers Association of Nigeria NPAN and Chairman/Editor -_: in -_: Chief of THISDAY Newspapers ,_,  Mr ._. 
Nduka Obaigbena ,_,  Tuesday affirmed his belief in Nigeria as a nation ,_,  despite the challenges it is going through and called for efficient management of its resources through the restructuring of the legislative list to create an environment that will make the country produce more Aliko Dangotes in the nation's economy ._. Obaigbena ,_,  in his contribution to the debate on the speech of President Goodluck Jonathan to the delegates at the inauguration of the National Conference ,_,  also called for the rebuilding of the middle class ._. Other delegates who spoke at yesterday's session included former Senate President Ken Nnamani who called for zonal rotational presidency with six -_: year tenure ._. According to Obaigbena ,_,  Nigeria is a nation of proud citizens and there are many opportunities for people to be all they want to be in the country ._. He said :_:  I have heard many people talk about how great Malaysia is; how great Brazil is ,_,  but if you want to be a Malaysian please go there ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  we are proud people ,_,  we are proud nationalities contributing to world affairs ._. And our people represent some of the best of humanity and we do not recognise ourselves ._. 
The other day ,_,  Wole Soyinka got the Nobel Prize for literature and he is being followed today by Chimamanda Adiche and Helon Habila who are garnering scores of international prizes for literature ._. The other day ,_,  Apple Computers bought an app from a Nigerian innovator; a few weeks ago ,_,  a Nigerian company ,_,  Oando ,_,  was able to raise $1 ._. 5 billion in the global market ._. 
We are making strides ._. 
Aliko Dangote is building factories in Nigeria and he was named the richest black man in the world ._. We cannot run down Nigeria ._. 
I am proud because in Nigeria you can be all you want to be ._. 
However ,_,  we have challenges; we will deal with the challenges ._. 
Life is as hellish in Maiduguri as it is in the inner cities of Chicago ._. 
Every country has its challenges; we will deal with those challenges ,_,  that's why we are here ._. 
The biggest challenge of our 100 years could be the civil war ._. 
I remember in those war days ,_,  my dad ,_,  a civil servant ,_,  drove our family out of the Mid -_: west when the Biafran soldiers arrived ._. We have to figure out how we can rebuild our middle class and in rebuilding our middle class ,_,  we have to fight extreme poverty ._. 
The World Bank chief the other day named Nigeria as one of the four countries with the highest rate of extreme poverty ._. 
Yes ,_,  people are making progress ,_,  but our extreme poverty is a result of corruption and our insecurity is a result of massive unemployment ._. All these point to one thing :_:  we are managing our resources inefficiently ._. 
Why is it inefficient We should revisit the structure of our governance and see how we have applied our resources ._. 
We should go to the legislative list and see if we even need a concurrent list because anything on the concurrent list always have to go to the federal ._. 
We have to deal with the structure of the country and we have to rebuild the structure for the next 100 years ._. Also contributing to the debate on the president's speech ,_,  Nnamani canvassed for a zonal rotational presidency with six -_: year tenure ,_,  stating that it will be in the overall interest of the nation's democracy to adopt the suggestion ._. The former Senate president who condemned the 'do -_: or -_: die politics' being practised by some politicians ,_,  said one of the ways to avoid such was to enshrine rotational presidency in the country's constitution ._. According to him ,_,  the constitution as it is presently constituted is faulty and therefore needs to be reworked ._. 
Nnamani added that since the aim of the National Conference was to ensure a new Nigeria where there would be justice and equity ,_,  there would be no need to keep the state of origin system as emphasis in the new dispensation should be on the state where one is domiciled ._. He also called for the restructuring of the political system through the devolution of powers from the centre to the states ,_,  adding that the federal government has no business in the management of drivers' licence as it is the duty of the state ,_,  as well as with the prison service ._. In his contribution ,_,  a former Speaker of the House of Representatives ,_,  Hon ._. 
Ghali Umar Na'Abba ,_,  spoke on the need for political parties to practise internal democracy as a panacea for ensuring credible elections and emergence of quality leaders ._. Na 'Abba said fixing the problems confronting Nigeria should start from addressing the leadership challenges facing the country ._. 
According to him ,_,  unless the processes of choosing leaders are addressed ,_,  the entire process of the conference would be defeated ,_,  hence advocating an improved internal democracy within the political parties as a measure to address the challenges confronting the emergence of leaders ._. The former speaker also accused governors of distorting the emergence of leaders and their successors in their respective states ._. 
He said :_:  In some cases ,_,  they bring their aides and servants to succeed them ._. 
The governors are by their actions eroding democratic tendencies ._. In the circumstances ,_,  there is no way there can be good leaders as the governors in the process of eroding the democratic tendencies and short -_: circuiting the processes ,_,  bring their children and personal aides to succeed them ._.   ._. A delegate from Rivers State and former governor of the state ,_,  Dr ._.  Peter Odili ,_,  said an ailment not correctly diagnosed could not be treated ,_,  adding that Nigeria started on a wrong footing because no Nigerian was consulted in 1914 when the Northern and Southern Protectorates were amalgamated to form Nigeria ._. He appealed to delegates to consider justice when the conference dissolves into committees ._. 
He advised participants to listen to each other and respond fairly ,_,  saying :_:  We must factor in the interest of the smallest and the strongest so that we will get to where we are destined to reach ._. The Lamido of Adamawa ,_,  Barkindo Aliyu Mustapha ,_,  stirred another controversy when he advocated a 100 per cent resource control on the condition that those calling for a total control of their resources should be willing to pay land rent and taxes to the federal government ._. He said :_:  I have observed that some people have started jumping the gun by commenting on issues like resource control ,_,  resource ownership amongst others ._. 
In this case ,_,  let me also jump the gun to say that states which don't have oil should allow the states that have to take a 100 per cent oil revenue and states which do not have oil should take land resource ._. That means ownership of land should revert to those states and anybody who wants to use the land or the structures on the land must pay rent to those states or the traditional owners of the land ,_,  for example ,_,  the Federal Capital Territory FCT ._. However ,_,  responding to his comments ,_,  a former House of Representatives Deputy Speaker ,_,  Hon ._. 
Chibudom Nwuche ,_,  said :_:  Is that really an issue I feel that it's his personal opinion and even if it is 100 per cent ,_,  the federal government will still get paid the taxes to provide common services ._. He added that there should be room for government to tax people and organisations in order to provide common services like foreign affairs and common currency ._. On restructuring ,_,  Nwuche said :_:  The current status quo has made everybody a loser and humbled the African giant because it has produced corruption ,_,  inefficiency ,_,  unemployment and many others ._. The leader of the South -_: east delegation ,_,  retired General Ike Nwachukwu ,_,  who described himself as a true Nigeria because of his parentage and marriage ,_,  said the essence of the conference was to ensure consensus and negotiation ._. 
He called for devolution of power to ensure true fiscal federalism ,_,  while asking the delegates to set aside petty prejudices in a bid to move the country forward ._. He also defended his primary constituency ,_,  the military ,_,  refuting a position by a delegate that there was tribalism in the military ,_,  adding that it remains the only united institution in the country ._. Former governor of old Anambra State ,_,  Senator Jim Nwobodo ,_,  who spoke on the right system of government for the country ,_,  said Nigeria is the only country that practices the presidential system like the United States ,_,  adding that the merits of the system outweigh its disadvantages ._. He also called on delegates to be less sentimental on the issue of religion ,_,  saying :_:  Religion is not an issue in the country ._. 
It is only a creation of the few selfish elite ._. He supported the position expressed by Nwachukwu and Nnamani on the need for restructuring of the federation and also said the youth should be used to promote development ._. 
Another delegate ,_,  Prof ._.  A ._. B ._. C ._. 
Nwosu urged his colleagues to focus more on the defects in the constitution to see how they can be improved ._. I want to quickly align myself with the position calling for resource control ,_,  he said ._. 
According to him ,_,  the reason for do -_: or -_: die politics in Nigeria is because of the total control of resources by the central government ,_,  which has also given rise to amorphous agency known as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC with its opaque management system that encourages corruption ._. The representative of the Nigeria Union of Journalists NUJ ,_,  Lanre Ogundipe ,_,  on his part ,_,  called for capital punishment for corrupt officials while a former Chairman of Punch Newspapers ,_,  Chief Ajibola Ogunshola ,_,  in his contribution ,_,  called for regulation of the number of children a family should have ,_,  while legislators should work on a part -_: time basis ._. A delegate ,_,  Abdullahi Okeiman ,_,  advocated a legislation to enable the implementation of the budget on time and also called for impeachment of the president for failure to implement the budget as passed by the National Assembly ._. Former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice ,_,  Chief Bayo OjoSAN ,_,  joined other delegates in calling for rotational presidency as well as zoning ._. 
According to Ojo ,_,  it is through zoning of offices that there would be justice and equity in the country ._. 
Organiser of the maiden Warri Tennis Coaching Clinic seems to be having hectic time controlling the huge number of school children ,_,  following high demand for late registration by some parents who want their kids to be part of the event ._. 
It will serve off today at the Shell Club ,_,  Ogunu ,_,  Warri ,_,  Delta State ._. The clinic ,_,  a grassroots tennis talent development programme ,_,  is holding in Warri from April 7 to 19 ._. 
It is for children between the ages of 6 -_: 16 years ._. It was gathered that some parents ,_,  who could not beat the deadline of free registration ,_,  have resorted to 'black market' ,_,  offering money to buy late registration form to enable their kids participate ._. Leading a team of tennis experts from Lagos to Warri is veteran tennis coach ,_,  Robinson Roy Odoko ._. 
Coach Peter Osagie will assist him ._. 
While Odoko ,_,  a former national tennis player will serve as Director of the clinic; Osagie will serve as Head Coach ._. 
Five other coaches drawn from Asaba ,_,  Benin City and Port Harcourt are already on ground in Warri for the exercise ._. Chief Executive Officer of Iso -_: Black Concepts Ltd ,_,  Igho Okor ,_,  said yesterday that the need to teach young tennis players ,_,  especially in primary and secondary school ,_,  the various techniques and strategy to adopt for winning matches ,_,  is the reason for the exercise ._. Most tennis tournaments and coaching clinics are organized in Lagos and as such ,_,  people in other urban centers are not opportune to witness and benefit from these tennis initiatives and this has been working against talent hunt and tennis development in some parts of the country ,_,  Okor said ._. He further explained that the programme is aimed at introducing the rudiments of tennis to the kids ,_,  saying that talents and potential champions in Warri and its environs would benefit greatly from the project ._. They are eagerly waiting to be discovered and nurtured to prominence ._. 
The Iso -_: Black Warri Tennis is structured and targeted at discovering such hidden talents in Warri and its environs ._. 
It will develop the game from grassroots level by teaching the young stars the basics of the game and appropriate strategy to adopt for winning matches ,_,  he added ._. The organisers have targeted 500 kids for the clinic ,_,  but the number increased to 800 as at yesterday following interest shown by parents who want their kids to benefit from the exercise ._. Okor said that equipment for the clinic such as playing racket; tennis balls and kitting have just arrived from London ._. 
Apart from enthusiasm shown by the kids ,_,  various corporate organisations ,_,  including SYKES Energiprojekts Ltd ,_,  NNPC ,_,  Standard Alliance Life Assurance Ltd ,_,  Carex ,_,  Shell Club ,_,  Ogunnu and Promasidor are sponsors for the event ._. 
It will run between 9 ._. 00 am and 2 ._. 00pm daily ,_,  Okor added ._. He hinted that at the end of the clinic in Warri ,_,  children who perform well would be taken to Lagos for further training and later taken to their partner Tennis Academy in South Africa ._. 
MoneyGram has announced the commencement of a partnership with Diamond Bank Plc to provide premium money transfer service at strategic locations in the country ._. Speaking on behalf of Diamond Bank Plc ,_,  the bank's Executive Director ,_,  Retail Banking ,_,  Mr ._. 
Uzoma Dozie ,_,  was quoted to have said in a statement that the partnership was an important milestone in providing secure and accessible money transfer services to meet the needs of the bank's customers ._. According to him ,_,  When we began money transfer services ,_,  the initial focus was to provide efficient transfer services to our customers trading across Nigeria so we spent about sixty per cent of our equity in building a convenient and accessible platform ._. 
Today ,_,  we are taking it to a different dimension and widening the platform to embrace Nigerians in the Diaspora ._. On his part ,_,  Divisional Head ,_,  Transaction and e -_: Banking ,_,  Diamond Bank ,_,  Mr ._. 
Daniel Akumabor ,_,  assured the MoneyGram team of significant growth on the platform as a result of the partnership ._. To the Executive Vice President ,_,  MoneyGram USA and Canada ,_,  Mr ._. 
Peter Ohser ,_,  with Diamond Bank joining the money transfer firm's network ,_,  it now has over 4000 active locations in Nigeria ._. What this means is when your loved one sends you money from Paris ,_,  or Oslo or Moscow ,_,  or Tokyo ,_,  or New York ,_,  you can receive that money ,_,  in ten minutes ,_,  almost anywhere in Nigeria ,_,  he added ._. Ohser described the partnership as a genuine way to provide solution to the need of Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora ._. MoneyGram service is a critical lifeline ,_,  allowing Africa's largest Diaspora -_: Nigerians Abroad  -_:  send money home to loved ones for upkeep ,_,  healthcare and education ._. 
Without our services and our partners ,_,  these Nigerians would fall prey to black market solutions which are susceptible to fraud and illegality ,_,  he noted ._. Commenting on the partnership ,_,  MoneyGram Vice -_: President Africa ,_,  Mr ._. 
Herve Chomel said he foresees rapid market expansion in the country ._. 
He therefore expressed delight in the partnership with the bank ._. 
Abuja � Super Eagles major sponsors will be approached by football bureaucrats to help the team in cushioning its 2014 World Cup budget deficit in Brazil ,_,  the Nigeria Football Federation NFF has announced ._. 
The amount appropriated for the World Cup is N1 ._. 2 billion equivalent of $7 million out of N2 ._. 8 billion about $12 million which the NFF asked from government to enable the Eagles participate at the global football spectacle ._. 
The approved grant will still leave a shortfall of N829 million about $4 ._. 5 million ._. NFF Secretary General ,_,  Musa Amadu ,_,  insisted at a media parley on Tuesday that the approved vote would barely be sufficient for the Eagles' first two weeks stay in Brazil ._. 
The World Cup ,_,  the most attractive sporting event in the world with 32 nations in attendance ,_,  will be staged from June 12 to July 13 in 12 centres across Brazil ._. While government is expected to come to the aid of the team given the unifying role of football in the country ,_,  Amadu said one option the federation was considering in order to plug the budget gap is to approach its sponsors ._. 
Some of the federation's strategic marketing partners include ,_,  Globacom ,_,  Samsung ,_,  Adidas and Guinness ._. 
The budget itself is the totality of what is needed to take the team to the last stage of the World Cup ._. 
We still have a shortfall that is yet to be specifically looked into but must be provided if we aim to go as far as we want at the competition ._. 
We should now explore those areas we spoke about -_:  getting our sponsors to chip in some money -_:  so that we will be able to concentrate on the project of doing well in Brazil ,_,  Amadu said ._. Nigeria's World Cup finances will cover several items ranging from daily allowances to players and officials ,_,  match bonuses and flight tickets for the team and national contingent among other sundry expenses ._. 
By comparison ,_,  while Nigeria's approved grant of $7 million is a far cry from Black Stars of Ghana's $9 ._. 6 million budget ,_,  it is a shade ahead of the $5 ._. 4 million Ivory Coast plans to spend and $5 ._. 8 million which Algeria proposed for their team at the tournament ._. 
Opening a modern supermarket in a city under threat from an Islamist insurgency ,_,  with the added uncertainty of wobbly public power supply ,_,  may sound like a retailer's nightmare ._. 
But what if that city stands on one of the oldest trade crossroads in Africa ,_,  offering a major chunk of one of the largest and fastest -_: growing retail markets on the continentSmall wonder then that major retail investors like South African grocer Shoprite and Wal -_: Mart unit Massmart Holdings are opening stores in Kano ,_,  the northern commercial hub of Nigeria ,_,  Africa's number one oil producer ,_,  and since Sunday ,_,  its largest economy ._. 
I always want to be bold enough to say ,_,  you can't be in Nigeria without being in Kano ,_,  Massmart Holdings' Africa Director Mark Turner told Reuters in Johannesburg at the Reuters Africa Summit this week ._. 
Nigeria ,_,  along with Angola and Kenya ,_,  is a strategic target market for the Wal -_: Mart subsidiary ._. Kano is a dusty centuries -_: old Sahel belt metropolis that once offered gold ,_,  salt ,_,  slaves ,_,  leather and famed indigo -_: dyed textiles in its teeming markets at the end of an ancient caravan route linking Libya to black Africa south of the Sahara ._. 
Now ,_,  amid banner signs proclaiming lower prices you can trust ,_,  Kano consumers can wheel their carts between shelves replete with commercial brands from across the globe in a brand -_: new ,_,  air -_: conditioned Shoprite supermarket ,_,  anchoring a larger $85 million shopping mall development in the city ._. In the coming weeks ,_,  Massmart will join Shoprite by opening one of its Game household appliance stores in the same Ado Bayero Mall ,_,  named after the emir of Kano State capital ._. 
The mall is designed to house 85 shops and will be among Nigeria's biggest ._. 
But the presence of armed and uniformed guards searching vehicles ,_,  opening boots ,_,  checking the underside for explosives with mirrors and frisking all shoppers is a sign that this particular mall location faces unusual security challenges ._. 
Despite being far from Maiduguri ,_,  the epicentre of a bloody five -_: year insurrection against the Nigerian state waged by Islamist sect ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  mostly in the North -_: east ,_,  Kano has also suffered the insurgency's impact ._. Bombings and shootings by Boko Haram militants killed at least 185 people ,_,  mostly Muslim civilians ,_,  in Kano in January 2012 ._. 
Explosions in July last year killed 11 people ,_,  and police and military roadblocks are now a feature of life in the city ._. 
We cannot wish away the fact that there are security concerns ,_,  Mohammed Hayatu -_: Deen ,_,  the Maiduguri -_: born entrepreneur and banker who chairs the group developing the Kano mall ,_,  said ._. The hulking power plant standing alongside the mall building  -_:  capable of producing nearly 5 ,_, 000 kilowatts  -_:  is a testimony to another challenge :_:  guaranteeing uninterrupted electricity in a country whose power deficit is notorious and where the rumble of the generator starting up is as familiar as the roar of traffic ._. 
Power and security are just like food and water ,_,  you can't survive without them ,_,  said another local businessman working on the mall ._. 
He asked not to be named ,_,  but his words encapsulate problems that are some of the biggest brakes to investment and growth not just in Nigeria ,_,  but in Africa as a whole ._. But despite the resilient optimism ,_,  Kano's commerce and industry have suffered from the Boko Haram insurgency and from restrictions to combat it like curfews and roadblocks ._. 
Tourists' visit to the city's historic sites has also dwindled ._. 
Foreign souvenir -_: seekers are rare now at the five centuries old Kofar Mata indigo dye pits ,_,  famed for the distinctive blue cloth that was a feature of the trans -_: Sahara trade ._. 
We have no capital to develop ,_,  said one of the dyers ,_,  Haruna Baffa ,_,  30 ._. 
But Hayatu -_: Deen was confident the arrival of more tenants at the Ado Bayero mall would have a dynamising effect ._. 
Nothing succeeds like success ,_,  he said ._. 
Eritrea perfectly illustrates the amount of guesswork involved in economic analysis of Africa ._. At the start of this week ,_,  Nigeria's GDP figures nearly doubled after the government recalculated economic output ._. 
Statisticians rebased their numbers to include changes to the economy ,_,  and in a heartbeat Africa's most populous country had also become its richest ,_,  leapfrogging South Africa by a mile ,_,  and shooting up the global rankings to join the likes of Norway and Poland ._. Although the ground under their feet was exactly the same ,_,  the country they were living in on paper had suddenly shifted for Nigeria's 170 million population ._. 
Or should that be 180 million Or 140 million Or even higher or lower The actual size of Nigeria's population is also based on questionable estimates and evidence ,_,  and it too is heavily contested ._. The fact that Nigeria's statistics are so deeply shrouded in doubt is striking especially given that it is ,_,  as we now know ,_,  the richest country on the continent ._. This begs the question :_:  if our understanding of Nigeria rests on such shaky ground ,_,  what about poorer ,_,  less well -_: connected ,_,  and more closed off countries For example ,_,  what about EritreaNo dataTrying to get any data about Eritrea can be a thankless task ._. 
Access to information is very limited and the authoritarian regime's relationship with any media apart from those run by its own information ministry is strained at best ._. The Horn of Africa nation is deeply isolated internationally and is considered to have one of the worst records in the world when it comes to civil liberties ,_,  political rights and domestic freedoms ._. Unsurprisingly ,_,  international headlines about the Red Sea state are rare ,_,  and when there is coverage ,_,  it is usually about runaways fleeing the nation's grip ,_,  abductions of Eritrean refugees in the Sinai Peninsula ,_,  human rights violations ,_,  or tentative predictions about how long the regime can last ._. With virtually no data to work with ,_,  it unsurprising that analysts also tend to shy away from the country ._. 
In continent -_: wide studies ,_,  Eritrea is often coloured in grey to demarcate 'no data' ,_,  while even multilateral organisations such as the African Development Bank sometimes have to release reports that pretend Eritrea does not exist ._. The 2012 African Economic Outlook Report ,_,  which is probably the most comprehensive analysis of the country for several years ,_,  provides a few valuable if limited insights ._. 
But even this most complete report on record misses out some hugely important features such as population size ._. Given the difficulties in estimating Eritrea's population  -_:  existing figures range from about 3 ._. 5 million to almost double that at 6 million or more  -_:  it is perhaps wiser not to guess at all ._. 
However ,_,  the size of the population has enormous consequences for all per capita figures ._. The World Bank ,_,  for example ,_,  estimates Eritrea's income per head to be $504 ,_,  basing its calculations on population figures of just over 6 million ._. 
If Eritrea's population were in fact closer to the 3 ._. 5 million mark ,_,  that income per head figure could be as much as $864 ._. The black marketHowever ,_,  especially when it comes to Eritrea ,_,  even reliable figures can only tell us so much ._. 
For instance ,_,  the country's black market for currency exchange significantly complicates things ._. The Eritrean currency has been pegged at 15 Nakfa to $1 since 2005 ._. 
Due to high inflation over many years ,_,  the currency has lost value ,_,  but the government keeps it fixed in an attempt to tackle external debt ._. This has contributed to the blossoming of a parallel and illegal internal market for currency exchange ._. 
Those caught exchanging currency on the black market can be imprisoned for up to 18 months ,_,  but the entire economy depends on such illegal exchanges ._. In late 2012 ,_,  the rates in this illicit market offered three times the amount of Nakfa per dollar compared to official rates ._. 
And in March 2013 ,_,  this already massive gap widened as the Eritrean government overvalued the national currency even more ,_,  fixing 10 Nakfa to $1 ._. One important implication of this when examining Eritrea's national economy is that using the official exchange rate is likely to hugely overestimate the real level of economic development ._. 
Using the rates found on the burgeoning black market would suggest the country is significantly poorer than if using the government's rates ._. Going a step further into the real detail of Eritrea's economy ,_,  unofficial sources report that most households in the capital Asmara receive an average of $350 per month in undeclared remittances from relatives abroad ._. There are two particularly well -_: known mechanisms through which these clandestine transfers takes place :_:  alongside shipments of contraband goods from Sudan ,_,  and when relatives from abroad visit ._. These transfers are likely to be hugely significant for Eritrea's economy ._. 
After all ,_,  a wage in the formal sector will at best leave you with 1500 -_: 2500 Nakfa per month ._. According to official rates ,_,  that comes to $150 -_: 250 ,_,  but in reality it is worth considerably less and is barely enough to survive ._. For most families in Asmara ,_,  therefore ,_,  remittances are crucial and often constitute the majority  -_:  sometimes as much as 90%  -_:  of their overall income ._. 
Counterintuitively perhaps ,_,  Eritrea's alarming brain drain ends up significantly stimulating its economy ._. However ,_,  not all families in Eritrea are so lucky ._. 
A pattern of regional migration has occurred within the country in which those that have no relatives abroad are destined to a rural life as subsistence farmers cultivating mostly barren land ,_,  while those with close ties to family outside the country can maintain a life in the capital ._. A shot in the darkAfter Nigeria's GDP was rebased earlier this week ,_,  nothing concrete changed ._. 
Nigerians didn't suddenly have more cash in their wallets ,_,  the unemployed were still unemployed ,_,  and the many malaises in the national economy went nowhere ._. However ,_,  in the medium term ,_,  the updated figures could have a considerable impact ,_,  especially as foreign investors look at the country in a different ,_,  far more rosy light ._. After all ,_,  statistics and economic analyses affect policies ._. 
Reliable figures can be crucial in helping actors  -_:  whether governments ,_,  individuals ,_,  corporations or multilateral organisations  -_:  make the right decisions ,_,  while unreliable ones can do the very opposite ._. When it comes to many countries ,_,  not least Eritrea ,_,  a great deal of caution needs to be taken before attempting any kind of shot in the dark ._. Jostein Hauge is doing a PhD at the University of Cambridge ,_,  researching economic growth and industrialisation in sub -_: Saharan Africa ._. 
He previously worked in Eritrea for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the European Commission ._. 
Gimba Kakanda's debut poetry collection Safari Pants was published in 2010 ._. 
His reputation as a poet ,_,  activist and columnist is on the rise and in this interview with Sunday Trust he shows glimpses ._. When did you first start writing ,_,  what made you feel the need to express yourself in this wayI may say writing was the influence of my father ._. 
But ,_,  on realising now that I was not his only child ,_,  my previous theory that access to his books and study was the reason for my burning quest to write ,_,  is no longer valid ._. 
Though access to books could be an explanation for such talent ,_,  certain mental and physical experiences could be responsible for the making of a writer ._. 
As a child ,_,  I was a bookworm ._. 
In fact ,_,  I had a memorable spat with my mother when she discovered that I was becoming too obsessed with her husband's books ._. 
First ,_,  my father was sick and away for medication ,_,  and she was worried that he won't be pleased that I raided his study in his absence ._. 
Second ,_,  there was a superstition among our people ,_,  a sort of myth that may be out of sheer lack of access to the psychiatrists ,_,  that those who read may likely go mad ._. 
And there were easy references in those days ,_,  people who reportedly went mad in their pursuits of academic scholarship ._. 
I began to write ,_,  initially ,_,  to imitate all the things I've read ,_,  and there was this ignorance that embarrasses me till date :_:  I mistook the poems I read for song lyrics ._. 
Seriously ,_,  I have no exact memory of when I began to write ,_,  but it's definitely in those magical years of my beautiful innocence and naivet� ._. Do you see your work as a hybrid kind of textI'm a product of my history ,_,  a product of all I've read and experienced ,_,  so I don't think I actually set out to write in a particular way ,_,  with peculiar nuances ,_,  or to break away from a tradition which I've not even mastered ._. 
I only imitated the masters I've read and they too were products of their histories ._. 
Every honest writer began with a curiosity and then imitation ._. 
And what are the makeup of this hybrid you're talking about In this internet age ,_,  with its flurry of indefinite texts ,_,  it's no longer easy to accurately label a writer's influence ,_,  form and even perfectly highlight his inspirations ._. How do you think African -_: American poetry is most egregiously undervalued or misnamedEvery protest literature is often stylistically half -_: done; it's a tutorial in the sense that its obsession with themes is a reason the writers are rarely experimental ._. 
The writers are just eager to be heard ,_,  to be listened to ,_,  to teach and to have their oppressors listed in the black book of sane humanity ._. 
So ,_,  if we want to judge the poetry of African -_: Americans especially in their early years ,_,  we must recognise the surreal atmospheres in which they existed ,_,  struggling to be human in a world that had unfairly stripped them of their humanities ._. 
No ,_,  a racially abused Langston Hughes may be a joke if he had attempted to dare the KKK in poems written in the style of the avant -_: garde ._. 
Like E ._. 
E ._. 
Cummings ._. 
So ,_,  back to your question ,_,  the less experimentation in the poetry of Black Americans in those years was understandably conditional ._. 
The modern African -_: American poets are not as socially and politically and even economically challenged ,_,  which is why they're as cerebrally experimental and creatively outlandish as their non -_: black counterparts in and outside America ._. Has your idea of what poetry is changed since you began writing poemsThe first piece I confidently called a poem was written to mourn my beloved mother in 2002 ._. 
So ,_,  like the African -_: Americans discussed above ,_,  I was similarly challenged ,_,  artistically deficient because the intent was to express in the most meaningful possible way the depth of my emotion and significance of the subject ._. 
So ,_,  yes ,_,  artistically every writer changes ._. 
In my own case ,_,  the philosophy was aptly expressed by the French playwright ,_,  Moli�re ,_,  thus :_:  Writing is like prostitution ._. 
First you do it for love ,_,  and then for a few close friends ,_,  and then for money ._. 
I embarked on this exciting literary adventure as an interpreter of my private experiences to keep my sanity in check ,_,  and then ,_,  when I was certain that it's becoming an art for the people ,_,  I wrote purposely to amuse a few friends ._. 
Now I write because writing is me ,_,  and whatever is me is expected to take care of my bills ._. 
So ,_,  yes ,_,  I endorse Moli�re's thesis ._. How do you get in the mental place where you find this deeper interior and writeAs a Nigerian living in Nigeria ,_,  you don't need any unusual kick to reflect ,_,  and write ,_,  on tragic happenings ._. 
Deeply ._. 
We are perfect portraits of the word tragedy in the ways we do things that defy explanations ._. 
We kill in the name of religion ._. 
We kill in the name of ethnicity ._. 
We kill in the name of regional patriotism ._. 
And these days ,_,  the spate of killing has become so rampant ,_,  I fear that our empathy is already becoming numb ._. 
The inspirations for my public commentaries as a columnist are never forced ,_,  I only need to remember ._. 
It's only my private events that are continuously dynamic ,_,  sensitive to the good and the bad I encounter in this unpredictable adventure called Life ._. Do you have a writing group or community of writers you share your work with Who are theyActually ,_,  I don't ._. 
In fact ,_,  I renounced my membership of a writers' community when I realised that it's just a pack of hopelessly inconsequential writers who have already forgotten the objective of that once internationally recognised body ._. 
Two years after I made that infamous decision ,_,  I'm yet to regret it ,_,  especially in considering how it now engages in petty internal politics ,_,  so much so that even the government of the day does not even recognise or honour its existence ,_,  yet they've been volunteering to be its sycophants ._. 
A writers' community is supposed to be the intellectual powerhouse of the nation; that none got a slot to participate in the on -_: going National Conference ,_,  which is meant to decide the future of this country ,_,  is an uppercase shame ._. 
On whether I share my works with fellow writers ,_,  yes ._. 
I'm lucky to have some of Nigeria's finest writers as dependable literary cronies ._. 
I'm talking about literary activist Adebiyi Olusolape ,_,  novelist Richard Ali and columnist Oris Aigbokhaevbolo ._. 
These three ,_,  I tell you ,_,  are incomparably ,_,  and dare I say extremely ,_,  brilliant ._. 
They're just one sentiment short of being geniuses ._. 
Another unfortunate helper was my ex -_: girlfriend ,_,  Sehar ,_,  with whom I was polishing my forthcoming novel before our breakup ._. 
It had to be her not only because she's a flawless editor ,_,  but being an Indian ,_,  I relied on her for endless criticisms of vaguely understood depictions ._. 
Because she's irreplaceable ,_,  and because I didn't expect the split ,_,  my novel is undergoing a needed textual operation now and ,_,  if I get those literary surgeons right ,_,  the book may end up coming in two parts ,_,  two sequenced novels ._. 
Any writer who has no private editor is professionally unready for the art !_. Do you think the poet has a specific role to play in human affairs in this century If so ,_,  what is itI have once averred that poetry is the mathematics of arts ,_,  that poetry is to arts what mathematics is to science ._. 
This is accurate because poetry sharpens a person's intellectual acuity and depth of imagination ._. 
Poetry encourages creative and even critical thinking ,_,  and if you agree with me that Nigeria is a nation where critical thinking has been in exile ,_,  you may understand the need for revived poetry tradition ._. How would you describe your internet presence and the state of poetry on social mediaI'm actually more known in the cyberspace today as a newspaper columnist ,_,  because I maintain a widely syndicated Friday column for a national daily ._. 
I slowed down on my obsession with poetry because ,_,  as Moli�re observed ,_,  I've reached that point in my life as an artist when I no longer write to please just my chums ._. 
I must disappoint you ,_,  the criticism tradition in cyberspace ,_,  especially on the social media ,_,  is unorganised ,_,  barely reliable ._. 
It's a frightening chaos !_. 
Being polarised by cliquey -_: minded promoters ,_,  it lacks the form ,_,  method and even dignity of the parallel being championed offline by genuinely erudite scholars at the academia ._. To what degree have you been published and to what degree has that helped or hindered your development as a poetI've only published a single collection of poems ,_,  Safari Pants ,_,  which was well -_: received among fellow poets and critics ._. 
That was in 2010 ._. 
I have not published any book since then ,_,  partly because I was busy working on my book ._. 
Actually it was out of utter disappointment in the hassles of publishing ,_,  especially marketing ,_,  in Nigeria ._. 
I burnt my energy in self -_: promoting my book ._. 
Today I don't find that really dignifying ._. 
So ,_,  I'm taking a break to work on a genre of literature for which a decent publishing contract is obtainable ._. 
I hope to publish my poems when I reach a certain height ,_,  and by this I mean visibility as an artist ,_,  in my devotion to literature ._. What do you see as the biggest opportunity facing a poet today ,_,  as compared to 50 years agoThe Internet is the only noticeable opportunity not available 50 years ago ._. 
Aside from that ,_,  poetry has actually lost its grace as an art of the skilfully imaginative ,_,  and now the rate at which doggerels are being produced is enough to let out my unexpressed observation ,_,  a confession ,_,  that poetry is dead !_. What do you see as the biggest challenge to a poet todayThe biggest challenge facing poets today is the temptation to condescend ,_,  to write deliberately substandard poems just to please an audience that ,_,  having gone too far in appreciation of outright abused forms of poetry ,_,  has now adopted Spoken Word as the ultimate standard ._. Name the 3 poems you are most proud of writing ,_,  the ones that you personally cannot forgetTough ,_,  very tough ._. 
Perhaps because all the poems in my debut and only collection ,_,  Safari Pants ,_,  were inspired by memorable experiences and events ,_,  it's difficult to select just three ._. 
So ,_,  for this ,_,  I'll say all the poems in my collection ._. Do you also write short stories Which do you find yourself drawn to the most oftenAside from my essays ,_,  I'm yet to publish a work of fiction of any length ._. 
I've been writing and editing and rewriting ,_,  searching for a particular genius I'm yet to possess ._. 
You see ,_,  if every writer takes his or her time to pursue his genius in the closet ,_,  before taking to the literary street to announce that she/he has arrived ,_,  there may be few rejection slips ._. 
We're too much in a hurry to be seen ,_,  to be famous ._. Some poets are also active in other creative areas ,_,  what are some of your favourite non -_: poetry or literary activitiesWriting is all I do best ._. 
Blabbing about any other engagement may be an empty boast ._. They say that to see the world with complete honesty one should look to comedians ,_,  artists and poets ,_,  what do you think emerges naturally from your workI'm not particularly good at self -_: assessment as that may be seen as an unforgivable form of masturbation ,_,  which is why I'm very happy that you didn't begin this interview with a very uncomfortable question like ,_,  Can you tell us about yourself To say I'm this and that does not always sit well with me ._. 
This ,_,  in a literary clime ,_,  should be the job of critics and reviewers ._. 
There are many things I think I am ,_,  but that may not be exactly so on a closer shot ._. Do you have one poem that you almost did not post due to it being so very personal Did you post it after all If so ,_,  please tell us about it ._. Sighs ._. 
All the poems in Safari Pants ,_,  my debut collection ,_,  were written while at certain crossroads in my life ,_,  and having survived those trials ,_,  the whole poems now make me blush ._. 
They're reminders of things I wish I never documented ._. All poets have several words that come up over and over again ,_,  words or sentences that they just can't help but use in their work ._. 
What are three of your absolute favourite wordsWow ._. 
Have I been conscious of such No ._.  If I've been given enough time for this interview I may have gone to reread all I've written to be sure of my most frequently used words ._. 
But ,_,  offhand ,_,  I'm not sure ._. Haha !_. 
And now ,_,  that's a stereotype I'll like to deconstruct ._. 
Some poets are eccentric just as some lawyers are ,_,  just as some doctors are ._. 
Or let me ask ,_,  Charly Boy is eccentric ,_,  is a poet Patrick Obahiagbon is eccentric ,_,  is a poet Denrele is eccentric ,_,  is he also a poet On which statistics are such labels based and justified It's also like saying writers are fond of women ,_,  but the most incurable womanisers among my friends are even non -_: writers ._. 
Generally ,_,  every artist tends to exhibit some notice me attitudes ,_,  perhaps of desperation ,_,  in bids to be relevant ._. 
Some artists exhibit such outrageous lifestyle as covers for their apparent lack or deficiency of talent ._. 
To some ,_,  it's a mere identity ._. 
Lady Gaga ,_,  for instance ,_,  was not the best pop star while she was in the brightest klieg -_: lights ,_,  but she dominated more talented contemporaries not because she sings better ,_,  but for her notice me dramatisations of imagined devilry ._. 
It's the same with some poets ,_,  it's the same with some painters ,_,  cartoonists and even professional journalists ._. 
This is why you'd see some people parading themselves and very loudly ,_,  as a writer whereas all we have ever contributed to literature are the mosaic of Adire and Kampala clothes they have been rocking to events just to be seen as dissenter ,_,  artist ,_,  different ,_,  and even genius  -_:  yet we have never ever seen their books ._. 
So ,_,  unless it's proven beyond doubts that I'm actually eccentric ,_,  and if ending an interview with poetic sentences are proofs of eccentricities ,_,  I'll rather be a dissident in the prison of stereotypes ._. 
Haha ._. 
Thank you ._. 
Just as the opening session of the national conference was dominated by the controversial issue of voting principle ,_,  the second week of the debate on the president's speech saw some ex -_: military leaders who are delegates clashing with politicians over the role of the military in the foisting of the widely criticised Nigerian constitution ._. 
Issues concerning the restructuring of the country and its governance engaged the delegates ,_,  while discussions were also centred on resource management and the question of insecurity in the land ._. Blame Game Just as the opening session of the national conference was dominated by the controversial issue of voting principle ,_,  the second week of the debate on the president's speech saw some ex -_: military leaders who are delegates clashing with politicians over the role of the military in the foisting of the widely criticised Nigerian constitution ._. 
Issues concerning the restructuring of the country and its governance engaged the delegates ,_,  while discussions were also centred on resource management and the question of insecurity in the land ._. 
The former military helmsmen and the politicians traded words on who should be held culpable for the weaknesses inherent in the 1999 Constitution ._. 
For a moment ,_,  the debate shifted to the issue of sponsorship of military coups in Nigeria ._. 
Some of the delegates engaged in accusations and counter accusation over who the real sponsors of the coups that brought the military into governance were ._. 
The first shot was fired by the former Minister of Defence and ex -_: Chief of Army Staff ,_,  General Alani Akinrinade ,_,  who insisted that the military had no apology to offer for their role in governance ._. 
He accused the Nigerian elite of aiding the military in their adventures into governance and subsequent drafting of the constitution that they were now condemning ._. 
All the constitutions that were drawn up at the Dodan Barracks or Aso Rock were drawn up by you ,_,  the elite ,_,  not the military ,_,  Akinrinade alleged ._. 
But on Wednesday ,_,  the former governor of Ogun State ,_,  Olusegun Osoba ,_,  voiced his disagreement with the General's views on the role of the political elite in the coming of the military juntas ._. 
He anchored his opinion on the fact that only two coups were executed against the civilian government ,_,  the rest were military against the military and this may have been sponsored by the military or its contractors ,_,  but definitely not the politicians ._. 
But General Paul Omu from Delta State countered Osoba ,_,  saying ,_,  All military coups are instigated by politicians and civilians before they are consummated while most wars are hatched by civilians long before it is fought ._. 
I also like to add that all wars that are fought by soldiers are started by politicians and civilians ._. 
General Akinrinade made a statement a few days ago and people tried to shout him down ._. 
In military regimes ,_,  civilians are 90 per cent participants in the running of the affairs of government ._. 
In drafting the 1999 Constitution ,_,  we did not have any military man as at that time who was a judge advocate or who was even a magistrate or a draftsman who could do legal drafting ._. Restructuring The blame game was put aside ,_,  so that delegates could confront the real deficiencies of the constitution ._. 
Omu said what the president wanted from his inaugural speech was simply the remodeling of the constitution ._. 
According to Omu ,_,  the federal government is very heavy and needs unbundling and something has to be done to help the government unbundle itself ._. 
But Senator Femi Okouromu tried to return to the criticism of the military for the ills of the country when he said ,_,  All these vices of today are the cumulative legacies of the misguided policies of successive military rulers and their civilian collaborators since 1966 ,_,  starting from the truncation of federalism ,_,  through the sectionally skewed creation of multiplicity of states beyond the initially justifiable and balanced 12 states of Gowon ,_,  to the introduction of the so -_: called presidential system of government ,_,  which now enables a one -_: man ruler in our states to personalise all state resources and loot the treasury as he pleases with impunity ._. 
The founder and leader of Nigeria Advance Party ,_,  Tunji Braitwaite ,_,  in his contribution said the country was not operating true federalism ._. 
According to him ,_,  I cannot say that we have a proper federal system ._. 
I think government should stop giving recognition to all the former military men who came to power through coup ._. 
For instance ,_,  the so called National Council of States ,_,  I will want it to be scraped or that all those who took over government through unconstitutional means should have no business at the Council of States meeting ._. 
On the issue of restructuring of the country ,_,  Braithwaite said he would rather demand a reconfiguration of the country ,_,  saying that those leaders insisting that the country is an indivisible entity are lying over the issue ._. 
While one is not advocating secession ,_,  the majority of the people would like to run their lives in their own way by their own culture and their own system ,_,  he said ._. 
Braithwaite suggested the restructuring of the country into 10 regional units along the clusters of language and cultural linkages ._. 
The president of Aka Ikenga ,_,  Chief Goddy Uwazurike ,_,  said Nigeria ,_,  had some fundamental problems crying for amelioration and ,_,  therefore recommend fiscal federalism ,_,  and rotation of the presidency and governorship positions ._. 
Uwazurike ,_,  whose group acts as the intellectual arm of the apex Igbo socio -_:  cultural body ,_,  the Ohaneze ,_,  insisted on the need for equality of the zones ,_,  stating that no zone should be more than other zones in the number of states ._. 
He also called for true federalism ,_,  devolution of the powers and local government autonomy ._. 
Similarly ,_,  former Minister of Police Affairs Adamu Maina Waziri ,_,  who is a delegate from Yobe State ,_,  said to attain greatness Nigeria must embrace true federalism ._. 
However ,_,  Waziri explained that true federalism can only be observed in Nigeria when Nigerians understand themselves and their inherent differences ._. 
Quoting a discussion he claimed took place between late Nnamdi Azikiwe and Sarduana of Sokoto ,_,  Ahmadu Bello ,_,  Waziri said ,_,  When Zik told the Sarduana of Sokoto that both North and South should forget their differences ,_,  the Sarduana responded that there is no way North and South can forget their difference ,_,  but that they can only understand their differences through true federalism ._. 
The conference witnessed one of its most elevating speeches when the president of Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria NPAN ,_,  Nduka Obaigbena ,_,  joined the debate to advocate the recreation of the middle class and many more of the Aliko Dangotes in the nation's economy ._. 
Obaigbena ,_,  while reaffirming his believe in Nigeria ,_,  said ,_,  I have heard many people talk about how great Malaysia is ,_,  how great Brazil is ,_,  if you want to be a Malaysian please go there ._. 
In Nigeria we are a proud people we are proud nationalities contributing to world affairs ._. 
And our people represent some of the best of humanity and we do not recognise ourselves ._. 
The other day ,_,  Wole Soyinka got the Nobel Prize for literature ,_,  he is being followed ._. 
Today there is the Chimamnda Adiches ._. 
The other day apple computers bought its applications from a Nigerian innovator ,_,  a few weeks ago ,_,  a Nigerian company ,_,  Oando ,_,  was able to raise 1 ._. 5 billion dollars in the global market ._. 
We are making strides ._. 
Aliko Dangote is building factories in Nigeria and he was named the richest black man in the world ._. 
We cannot turn down Nigeria ,_,  I am proud because in Nigeria you can be all you want to be ._. 
However ,_,  we may have challenges; we will deal with the challenges ._. 
Life is as hellish in Maiduguri as it is in the southern part of Chicago ,_,  every country has challenges ._. 
We will deal with those challenges ,_,  that's why we are here ._. 
The biggest challenge of our 100 years could be the civil war; I remember in those war days ,_,  my dad ,_,  a civil servant ,_,  drove me out of Mid -_: west when the Biafrans arrived ,_,  We have to figure out how we can rebuild our middle class and in rebuilding our middle class; we have to fight extreme poverty ._. 
The World Bank chief the other day named Nigeria as one of the four countries with the highest rate of poverty ._. 
Yes ,_,  people are making progress ,_,  but poverty goes with corruption ,_,  unemployment goes with insecurity ._. 
All these go to one issue ,_,  we are managing our resources inefficiently ._. 
Why is it inefficient We should revisit the structure of our government and see how we have applied our resources ._. 
We should go to the legislative list and see if we even need a concurrent list because anything on the concurrent list always has to go to the federal ._. 
So we have to deal with the structure of country and we have to build the structure of our country for the next 100 years ._. 
Obaigbena's speech was followed by that of former Senate President Ken Nnamani ,_,  who said the present constitution was faulty and ,_,  therefore ,_,  needed reconstruction ._. 
Nnamani condemned the do or die politics ,_,  saying one of the ways to avoid such is ensuring that there is rotational presidency with a six -_: year tenure enshrined in the constitution ._. 
According to Nnamani ,_,  introducing rotational presidency among the six geopolitical zones with six -_: year tenure will serve to instill stability in the polity ._. 
He also called for the restructuring of the political system through the devolution of powers from the centres to the states ,_,  explaining that the federal government has no business in the management of issues like the drivers' license and the prison service ,_,  as they are the duty of the state ,_,  as well as ._. 
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Ghali Na'Abba said fixing the problems confronting Nigeria should start from addressing the leadership challenges facing the country ._. 
He said unless the process of choosing leaders was addressed ,_,  the essence of the conference would be defeated ._. 
Na'Abba advocated improved internal democracy within the political parties ._. 
The former speaker accused the state governors of distorting the emergence of leaders and their successors in their respective states ,_,  saying ,_,  In some cases ,_,  they bring their aides and servants to succeed them ._. 
The governors are by their actions eroding democratic tendencies ._. 
In the circumstances ,_,  there is no way there can be good leaders ,_,  as the governors in the process of eroding the democratic tendencies and short circuiting the processes ,_,  bring their children and personal aides to succeed them ._. Resource Control ,_,  Onshore/ Offshore Dichotomy Signs of what to expect at the committee stage of the national conference ,_,  especially on revenue and resource control ,_,  emerged at the plenary session when the debate on the speech of the president shifted attention to the issues of resource control and onshore/offshore dichotomy ._. 
The Lamido of Adamawa ,_,  Barkindo Aliyu Mustapha ,_,  first stirred the controversy when he advocated a 100 per cent resource control but added that those calling for a total control of their resources should be willing to pay land rent and taxes to the federal government ._. 
He said ,_,  I have observed that some people have started jumping the gun by commenting on issues like resource control ,_,  resource ownership ,_,  etc ._.  In this case ,_,  let me also jump the gun to say that states which don't have oil should allow the states which have oil to take a 100 percent oil revenue and states which don't have oil should take land resource ,_,  that means ownership of land should revert to those states and anybody who wants to use the land or the structures in the land must pay rents to those states or the traditional owners of the land ,_,  for example ,_,  the FCT ._. 
In countering the Lamido ,_,  the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives Chibudom Nwuche asked ,_,  Is that really an issue I feel that is his personal opinion and even if it is 100 per cent ,_,  the federal government will still tax to provide common services ._. 
There should be room for government to tax to provide common services like foreign affairs ,_,  common currency and FRSC ._. 
You cannot subsume this under 100 per cent ._. 
Although ,_,  it could be a good concept but you must allow the federal government the right to tax ._. 
The leader of the South -_: east delegation to the national conference ,_,  General Ike Nwachukwu ,_,  who described himself as a true Nigeria because of his parentage and marriage ,_,  stated that the essence of the conference was to ensure consensus and negotiation ._. 
He called for devolution of power to ensure true fiscal federalism ,_,  asking the delegates to set aside petty prejudices and move the country forward ._. 
He also defended his primary constituency ,_,  the military ,_,  refuting a position by a delegate that there is tribalism within the military ._. 
He said that the military remained the only united institution ,_,  saying ,_,  There is no tribalism in the military ._. 
Former governor of old Anambra State ,_,  Senator Jim Nwobodo ,_,  said Nigeria was the only country that practised the presidential system like the U ._. S ._.  ,_,  explaining that the merits of the system outweigh its disadvantages ._. 
Nwobodo said ,_,  Religion is not an issue in the country ._. 
It is only a creation of the few selfish elite ._. 
I want us to start acting like true and one Nigeria from here ._. 
The country is not cursed but blessed ._. 
On the issue of structure ,_,  he said he aligned himself with the position expressed by Nwachukwu and Nnamani on the need for restructuring of the federation ._. 
He said the youth should be used to promote development in the country ._. 
Former Minister of Health ,_,  Professor ABC Nwosu ,_,  in his contribution urged the delegates to focus on the faults of the constitution to see how they can be improved ,_,  stating that key among the issues is devolution of powers ._. 
I want to quickly align myself to the position calling for resource control ._. 
The reason for the do or die syndrome in the polity is because of the takeover of control of resources from the states by the central government ,_,  which has also given rise to amorphous agency known as the NNPC with the attendant corruption ._. 
But it was a delegate representing the Arewa Conservative Forum ,_,  Alhaji Ibrahim Mai Sule ,_,  that reignited the debate on the onshore/offshore dichotomy ._. 
Sule said it was in the interest of the country to go back to the off shore  -_:  on shore dichotomy principle ._. 
He explained that it was enshrined in the 1963 Constitution ,_,  but removed in the 1999 Constitution ,_,  asking the conference to ensure that it is reintroduced in the new constitution that would be formulated ._. 
Another delegate ,_,  Mr ._. 
Suleiman Bello ,_,  from Sokoto State ,_,  who said he had the mandate of the people of the state to ask for the re -_: introduction of the onshore/offshore dichotomy ,_,  defended his position by saying it would engender the return for true federalism ._. 
According to Bello ,_,  Sokoto State is pushing for the sustenance of the current federal structure as well as the need to devolve powers from the federal government to the states ._. 
But a delegate from Akwa Ibom State ,_,  Udo Mbana ,_,  countered both delegates from the North ,_,  citing the International Law of the Sea ,_,  article 187 and the Continental Shelf laws ,_,  which gave the oil within 200 metres of the sea to the coastal states ._. 
Mbana also argued that in line with section 43 of the 1999 Constitution ,_,  reintroduction of the onshore/offshore dichotomy was against the spirit of true federalism ,_,  asking ,_,  Does it mean when a part of a state is submerged by water ,_,  does it mean that the submerged portion is no longer part of the stateLegality of the Conference In the course of the discussions ,_,  the issue of legality of the national conference and its outcome also came up amid controversy ._. 
There was a sharp disagreement between Professor Awwal Yadudu and Mr ._. 
Femi Falana on the constitutionality of the national conference ._. 
Both Falana and Yadudu disagreed on whether the conference had the final powers to formulate a new constitution ._. 
In his contribution on the constitutionality of the national conference ,_,  Yadudu said ,_,  I think many in this conference will agree to participate if they are to submit themselves to an election ._. 
Without election we cannot claim to reconstruct Nigeria and I join all those who said that we should not usurp the function of the National Assembly ._. 
Somebody has argued that even the National Assembly ,_,  as it is presently constituted ,_,  lack the credibility to legislate on a new constitution or undertake the reconstruction of the federation ._. 
This is based on the account of the flawed electoral system that brought them ._. 
But Falana ,_,  who represents the conference in court in attempts to decide its legality ,_,  said Yadudu was only expressing a political opinion that he was entitled to ._. 
He said that in terms of legitimacy ,_,  the relevance of the conference will be decided by the Nigerian people ,_,  depending on the profundity of the resolutions that will emerge from there ._. 
He said ,_,  Going by history ,_,  I think the statement made by Yadudu is factually incorrect and even legally erroneous ._. 
Since 1967 ,_,  the country has had one constitutional amendment or the other; it has never been set up by law ._. Arrest of Journalist by SSS The national conference was not spared the drama of harassment of media men by security operatives ._. 
Following a story that was published in Daily Sun over alleged exchange of blows between an operative of the Department of State Service DSS and a policeman at the venue of the ongoing national conference ,_,  its reporter ,_,  Mr ._. 
Iheanacho Nwosu ,_,  was detained by the officers of the DSS ._. 
But for the intervention of conference leadership and delegates ,_,  journalists covering the conference would have staged a boycott of coverage of the conference ._. 
Nwosu ,_,  one of the accredited journalists covering proceedings at the conference ,_,  was picked by DSS operatives about 2pm on Wednesday ._. 
He was taken to their office within the National Judicial Institute NJI ,_,  venue of the conference and detained for over 30 minutes ._. 
He was eventually released after some journalists besieged the area where he was being detained ._. 
The operatives said they were embarrassed by the report after being queried by their superiors and the presidency over the ugly incident ,_,  which occurred on Tuesday ._. 
The action of the DSS operatives was condemned by delegates ._. 
One of the delegates ,_,  Niyi Akintola ,_,  who raised a point of order when plenary resumed after their break warned that in a democratic dispensation ,_,  it was wrong for security operatives to infringe on the rights of a journalist who was carrying out his responsibilities ._. 
The deputy chairman of the conference ,_,  Professor Bolaji Adeyemi ,_,  warned security agencies to respect the rights of people who were carrying out their legitimate duties ._. 
For Olufunke Ogeah ,_,  the CEO of Pace Gifts ,_,  growing up in England was fun ._. 
However ,_,  this Biochemist and Education/Career Consultant for the youth had her fun in England cut short by her parents who had to trick her back to Nigeria because they knew the step could devastate her ._. 
Olufunke suddenly found herself in a Lagos -_: bound ship ._. 
She was in tears and miserable through out the two weeks journey to Lagos ._. 
Well ,_,  she had to quickly face the reality of living in Lagos; Olufunke settled down quickly and enjoyed all that Lagos offered ._. 
After graduating ,_,  she worked in various organisations including the University College Hospital ,_,  London ,_,  The Royal London Hospital ,_,  Whitechapel and The Royal Free Hospital ,_,  Hampstead ,_,  London as a Biomedical Scientist ._. 
In 1996 ,_,  Olufunke set up 'Pace Gifts' ,_,  a branding ,_,  creative design ,_,  promotional and corporate gift company ._. 
Her love for teaching children and young persons led her to set up Camp@ctivity ._. 
She also runs 'Pace Consults' ,_,  an education ,_,  career and employment consultancy and The 'Votive Ball Initiative' ,_,  involved in preparing young persons for leadership roles ._. 
This boisterous lady shares some of the high and low points of growing up in London and Lagos; and some intimate secrets with Yemi Adebowale and Chibuzor OliYou grew up in London ._. 
What was it like ,_,  growing up in this cityGrowing up is unforgettable and was great fun ._. 
It gave me the platform to be who I really am today ._. 
I was born in London and the fourth child of six children ._. 
My immediate older brother Ayo and I lived with my parents Mr ._.  and Mrs ._. 
Stepen Taiwo Koya who were schooling and working during the week and sometimes at the weekend ,_,  in London ._. 
We were dropped off with different nannies and collected for the weekend every three weeks ._. 
I lived from the age of one year with one ,_,  Mrs ._. 
Turner fondly called Nanny Turner and her family in Sittingbourne ,_,  Kent ._. 
She was loving and swamped me with books from such a very early age and I became an avid reader by the age of three ._. I still have memories of returning to Nigeria on a ship with my mother Ayo and my junior sister Bola in 1965 ._. 
We were all seasick throughout the two week journey but I was particularly very tearful and miserable because I was tricked away and separated from my 'Nanny Turner' ._. We were reunited with my dad and united with Tunde and Yemisi ,_,  my older siblings for the first time ._. 
My youngest sister ,_,  Subomi ,_,  was born years after ._. While growing up ,_,  we were a close knit family ,_,  doing things together ._. 
We were brought up looking out for each other ._. 
We had prayers every morning ._. 
We had our meals together ,_,  went to school together ,_,  attended church together every Sunday and played together ,_,  regardless of the many fights ,_,  we all indulged in ._. 
Every weekend ,_,  we visited the Bar Beach or the Federal Palace Hotel ,_,  for lunch rendezvous ,_,  with other relations ,_,  unfailingly ._. As we all grew older ,_,  when separated during school term as boarders ,_,  we all looked forward to our reunion during holidays ._. 
I looked out greatly for Bola and Subomi like a mother hen ._. Tell us about your parents; who influenced you most between the two of them What were the lessons you learnt from them while growing upWhile growing up in Lagos ,_,  my Dad ,_,  an Accountant ,_,  worked at Dunlop for many years and eventually became a Dunlop goods distributor ,_,  having his own company ._. 
My Mum ,_,  a Hairdresser and Beautician worked for two salons and eventually started her own hair and beauty salon and became one of the top two salons in Lagos and top five in Nigeria ._. My Dad was my Mathematics teacher throughout my primary school and my life skills teacher ._. 
He was patient and fun ._. 
Being an inquisitive child ,_,  during our conversations ,_,  he would explain ongoing happenings in Nigeria and other topics to me ._. 
He listened to me and corrected my wrong notions or doings ,_,  in an explanatory way ._. 
He was my confidence builder ._. 
He disciplined me when required ,_,  but not too often ._. 
He liked and taught me do -_: it -_: yourself house appliance ,_,  set up skills ._. 
He taught me independent and critical thinking skills ._. 
We would both read through all the volumes of Encyclopedia books he bought for the whole family ,_,  back then and discuss various topics ._. At fifteen years ,_,  he told me not to marry anyone who didn't have the same values with me ._. 
The emphasis was on 'values' and not 'money ._. ' I never forgot that advice ._. My Mum ,_,  was still is loving ,_,  very prayerful and a disciplinarian ._. 
Our prayers ,_,  studies and domestic chores ,_,  had to be carried out ._. 
She was my moral and etiquette instructor ._. 
She taught me decency skills; loving myself and my body and not letting anyone tell or treat me otherwise ,_,  especially the opposite sex ._. 
Every detail about our appearance had to be perfect ,_,  whether it was make -_: up or hair style or the way my sister's and I walked or spoke ._. 
She birthed fashion sense in me ._. 
My Mum taught me how to cook ,_,  clean and tidy up from a very early age ._. 
By twelve ,_,  I was cooking for the family ._. 
She made us memorize Psalms 23 ,_,  91 and 121 and recite it to her every morning during prayers ._. 
My Mum prepared me for independent life and marriage from teenage -_: hood ._. 
She taught me to be hardworking ,_,  diligent and responsible ._. She emphasized the fact that every woman must be financially proactive and independent and that any woman who didn't have a decent means of making an income was as good as a dead woman ._. 
I learnt different but pertinent skills from my parents ._. 
My Dad was my mental confidence builder ,_,  while my Mum was my spiritual and character builder ._. Tell me about your husband When and how did you meet himMy husband ,_,  Mr ._. 
Chike Christopher Ogeah is a Psychologist ,_,  Lawyer and presently the Commissioner for Information in Delta State ._. 
He is my soulmate and best friend ._. 
He is an intelligent ,_,  resourceful ,_,  loving ,_,  loyal ,_,  kind and considerate man ._. 
We met on our first week of admission into the University of Lagos September 1980 ._. 
He got admitted as a direct entry student and I got admitted as a preliminary year student ._. 
He came with a friend ,_,  Duro ,_,  to take out my best friend ,_,  Rola ,_,  on a pre -_: arranged date or so I thought at the time ._. 
Rola insisted on my coming with her ._. 
I grudgingly rode in their car ,_,  to a food and drink place called 'black market' on campus ._. 
Chike tried unsuccessfully to open conversation with me that night but met my exhibition of anti -_: social behaviour and monosyllabic answers ._. He wasn't deterred and kept coming back ._. 
I eventually realised he was quite interesting to talk with after about two weeks but played 'hard to get' because of my upbringing ._. 
I thank God for this ._. 
The fear of my mother ,_,  then ,_,  even as an undergraduate ,_,  was the beginning of wisdom ._. 
I eventually officially started dating him eight months after and married him ten years later ._. So far ,_,  how has marriage beenMarriage has been absolute bliss to the glory of God ._. 
We started and built our home together ,_,  from scratch ,_,  through trust in God and each other's abilities ._. 
Our love and respect for each other ,_,  the act of responsibility ,_,  hardwork and diligence ,_,  regardless of the numerous challenges we faced also helped ._. 
We have been blessed with three wonderful children ,_,  Uche ,_,  Uzoma and Chike and brilliant careers ._. How long have you been married and what is the secret behind the success of your marriageWe've been married for twenty -_: three beautiful years to God's glory ._. 
Twenty four years by this June ._. 
The secret behind the success of our marriage is love for God ,_,  trust in God as well as love and respect for and belief in each other ._. 
Chike and I are best friends first ,_,  before lovers and have always been ._. 
We know each other so well ,_,  even in our mannerisms and thoughts ._. 
We are soul mates ._. What are your greatest recollections while in schoolI attended Grange School for three years and hated every minute of it because I was bullied and experienced racism ._. 
This was strange to me ,_,  especially coming from England and living for four years with an English family ._. 
I only realised I was a 'black child' when I attended Grange School ._. I was moved to Maryland Convent Primary School ,_,  Ikeja and finished my primary education there ._. 
I enjoyed and blossomed in this institution ,_,  both academically and socially ._. 
It was a convent school ,_,  run by Catholic missionaries who deciphered and enhanced hidden talents in every child and taught us in an atmosphere of excellent learning and calm ._. 
I was given a double promotion because of my academic prowess ._. 
My best friend and greatest academic rival was a young Sri Lankan girl called 'Ruby ._. ' She always scored higher in every Mathematics test ._. 
If I scored 99% ,_,  she would score 100% ._. 
If she came first ,_,  I came second ._. 
I tried so hard to beat her in Mathematics ,_,  in vain ._. 
I became the Mathematics champion when she left the school; it was a bittersweet relief ._. I also remember my misery brought about by a boy called 'Muyiwa ._. ' I will spare his identity by not stating his surname ._. 
In Primary Five special Primary six ,_,  he seized my chocolate milk drink and snack everyday ,_,  bullied me and made me fall unknowingly to the ground ,_,  by shifting my chair backwards ,_,  after standing up to greet our class teacher ,_,  to my humiliation ._. 
He sat next to me and I was petrified of him and didn't breathe a word to any of my parents ._. 
I was later smacked and told off by my mother ,_,  for being such a 'weakling' ,_,  for my classmate ,_,  when she mistakenly found out ._. 
I had to make a quick decision to stop both the bullying in school and admonishment at home ._. 
On the D -_: day ,_,  I resisted Muyiwa's bullying and refused to give him my milk and snack ._. 
He tried to bully me and shouted at me on the playground in the presence of other children ._. 
I remembered my mother's admonishment and warned him to back off or he'll be sorry ._. 
He was shocked out of his wits ._. 
After my resistance a few times ,_,  he walked off and that was the birth of my tongue unlock ,_,  boldness and absolute freedom from the bullying menace ,_,  from then ,_,  till this day ._. 
I became a defender of the bullied ._. I attended Reagan Memorial Secondary School ,_,  Yaba ,_,  Lagos ,_,  for my secondary education Ordinary Level and Queen's College ,_,  Yaba ,_,  Lagos for Advanced Level ._. 
Reagan ,_,  being another missionary school with a Christian worship ethos ,_,  impacted greatly on my life ,_,  in terms of the daily chapel attendance ,_,  singing of hymns and Bible reading ._. I made good friends here and had excellent teachers from different races ._. 
I received a well -_: rounded education academically ,_,  spiritually ,_,  morally and recreationally that prepared me for life ._. 
I am an alumnus of the University of Lagos ,_,  where I studied Biochemistry ._. Tell us about your first jobI worked for one year as a Youth Corper at African Petroleum ,_,  Lagos ._. 
I had a brief stint in the Chemical Laboratory ,_,  analysing petroleum products for three months in the plant in Ijora and finished off in the Administration department ,_,  at the head office on Broad Street ,_,  Lagos ._. 
I found it a bit boring ._. What are some of the challenges you have faced so far in lifeI have faced and overcome various challenges to the glory of God ._. 
My greatest challenge was when my husband was mis -_: diagnosed with a health challenge for almost a year in Lagos and had to relocate abroad for true diagnosis and treatment ._. 
This was a trying period for our family and I became very prayerful ,_,  asking for God's direction and instruction ,_,  for my husband's total healing ._. 
Our children were very young and this was spiritually ,_,  mentally and physically tasking for me ._. 
God showed himself strong in our lives and I thank God for Chike's total recovery ._. What is your greatest fear in lifeNot fulfilling all God's will for my life as a wife ,_,  mother in my ministry and career ._. What qualities attract you to people and what puts you off about people Confident ,_,  truthful ,_,  loyal ,_,  hardworking ,_,  consistent ,_,  diligent and responsible people with integrity are the qualities that I find attractive in people ._. 
Dishonest ,_,  lazy ,_,  indecent and selfish people are a turn -_: off for me ._. Would you say that you're fulfilled in your career ,_,  marriage ,_,  and other aspects of your lifeFulfillment is a feeling of happiness and satisfaction and can also be described as the completion of something ._. 
Fulfillment to me is a continuous process ,_,  especially in my career ,_,  marriage ,_,  as a homemaker and my ministry ._. 
I am happy and very satisfied so far and still working for more improvement on each aspect ._. Are there still things you want to achieveI still have a few ideas I'm working on ._. How did your youth development and empowerment programme start What prompted you to start itI realised my passion for youth development and empowerment at all levels ,_,  from childhood to adulthood during my National Youth Service Year and was confirmed while working as a Biomedical Scientist abroad ._. 
I am very happy whenever I am in the company of children or young people ._. 
I automatically engage them mentally on academics and institution choices ,_,  current affairs ,_,  future career choices ,_,  reasons for their options ,_,  their wellbeing and many other relevant matters ._. I was very much involved in my children's school activities both academically and recreationally in England ._. 
I enjoyed volunteering for school trips and at 'class reading' sessions ._. 
I was on the Parents Teachers board; was a Junior and Teenage Church teacher for ten years and also helped advice children of friends and relations ,_,  on education matters ,_,  on a voluntary basis ._. My love for teaching and counseling children and young persons endeared me to the Mentoring and Counseling profession ._. I noticed the emphasis on an academic -_: only focus ,_,  in most primary and secondary schools in Nigeria ._. 
Children need a well -_: rounded education ,_,  incorporating both academics and recreational activities ._. 
In 2003 ,_,  I set up Camp@ctivity ,_,  a recreational and social development day camp ,_,  during holidays ,_,  for children aged between five and sixteen years ,_,  in Abuja ._. 
Here ,_,  children were exposed to various recreational activities and games and taught etiquette and social skills ._. The effect was astonishing as the children who attended ,_,  broadened their horizons better and developed improved mental ,_,  physical and social skills ._. I also observed that Nigeria was such a child and youth -_: unfriendly nation and hardly noticed ,_,  let alone ,_,  celebrated her youth ._. 
This was very disturbing to me ,_,  as Nigerian adults ,_,  regardless of their antecedents ,_,  were celebrated everywhere in the print and electronic media ._. 
One becomes used to the people thrown in one's face and they become role models for most of our youth ._. 
The Nigerian youth under thirty -_: five years ,_,  make up about 70% of our population and need to be celebrated ,_,  encouraged and prepared for their future role as leaders ,_,  in the next five to ten years ,_,  whether we adults like it or not ._. 
Integrity is key to building leaders and I have noticed a lack of this virtue ,_,  as well as pristine values ,_,  such as hardwork ,_,  diligence and responsibility ._. 
The message of integrity and hardwork ,_,  being rewarding and most importantly ,_,  lasting ,_,  needs to be emphasized ._. I was also worried about the unemployment rate ,_,  especially after the mandatory Youth Service programme ,_,  among University graduates in Nigeria and those returning home ,_,  from the Diaspora ._. 
I was worried that all the education ,_,  exposure and higher institution experience ,_,  achieved by all these young people ,_,  will be wasted ._. 
Most also lacked work experience and possessed untapped entrepreneurial skills ._. 
I prayed about my concern and in 2010 ,_,  Pace Consults Company ,_,  featuring the Votive Ball Initiative ,_,  was born ._. 
Pace Consults is an education ,_,  career and employment consultancy ,_,  involved in the development ,_,  enlightenment ,_,  and enhancement of necessary skill and etiquette requirements of office and administrative roles for young adults ,_,  as interns ,_,  studying within Nigeria and in the Diaspora ,_,  in preparation for life after University ._. Student and graduate placements with partnering Nigerian companies are encouraged ._. 
These essential skills prepare them early enough ._. 
In return ,_,  they add value to the company ,_,  which may be enhanced by the fact that they need little or no training ,_,  after graduation ._. 
The Votive Ball Initiative VBI is the sensitization and nurturing of young persons in Upper Sixth form ,_,  University undergraduates and graduates in Nigeria or the Diaspora on the most suitable career ,_,  employment and/or entrepreneurship path ,_,  to pursue ,_,  before the age of 30 years ._. 
It's an opportunity to celebrate our youth in preparation for leadership politically or in different vocations ._. The VBI Slogan is ,_,  Responsible Youths ,_,  Make Responsible Adults and Responsible Leaders ._. 
The young adults are sensitized ,_,  enlightened ,_,  nurtured and encouraged to network and brainstorm for wealth creation strategies ,_,  participation in governance and leadership development methods ._. 
Issues that will hopefully build a corrupt -_: free and improved Nigeria; create awareness and understanding of their social responsibility towards the disadvantaged and vulnerable in the Nigerian society and Africa ,_,  at large ,_,  are discussed ._. 
They are encouraged to adopt the 'power dressing' ,_,  attitude and prepare for that leadership role ._. 
Proven leaders of integrity in different industries are invited to speak ,_,  encourage and network with these young people ._. 
It is interactive and for once ,_,  it is all about our young people and appreciating as well as encouraging them to be what they want to be and not be cowered by any adult or institution ._. 
The Votive Ball ,_,  has been successfully hosted for four years and holds on the last Friday in December ,_,  every year ,_,  with an appropriate trending theme ._. What is your favorite foodAmala ,_,  ewedu and palm oil stew with different meat types or fish ._. What is your favorite colourPeach
Minna � There is one place in Niger State synonymous with pottery making and that is Tatiko village ,_,  where all the women folk and children are Potters ,_,  a handcraft which has become a primary source of livelihood for them ._. Pottery business has helped greatly in reducing the level of poverty in the village where clusters of potters under the tree fashion out pots ._. 
They are easily noticed along the only road in the village ,_,  therefore leaving no one visiting the village for the first time in doubt of the predominant business in the village ._. Tatiko is also the village where married women do not rely on their spouses but are able to fend for themselves ,_,  considering the fact that every grown -_: up girl in the community is a potential potter ._. Mama Amina Suleiman has been in the business of pottery for over 40 years and said she would not have known how life could be without the craft because it has been the only business that has kept her moving ._. She explained that pottery business does not require capital to start but only the knowledge of what is being needed to start production ,_,  hence the secret to sustaining the business through generations in the village ._. She told Weekly Trust that there are three different types of clay needed for pottery -_: making ,_,  namely ,_,  Azun ,_,  Red Laka and White Laka ,_,  which are the basic materials ._. 
Also ,_,  all the classes of clay are dug from the ground ._. Azun clay is sticky but soft ,_,  like cement ,_,  whereas the other two types of Laka are the components that must be mixed with Azun to produce a more sticky mixture capable of giving a high quality end product ,_,  it was learnt ._. When three head -_: pans full of raw materials that can produce an average of five pots are dug from the ground ,_,  they are deposited in a specially excavated space within the compound and allowed to be soaked in three buckets of water for a period of about seven to eight hours ._. While It takes one an average of six to nine hours to be able to gather the required quantity of all the types of clay needed for the molding of pots ,_,  the raw materials remain soaked while covered with a polythene bag ._. Mama intimated that they are covered because the soaked clay must remain free from any other foreign object or dirty material ,_,  otherwise the pot will not be smooth and will have a lot of dents and thus naturally would break easily ._. 
At this point the raw material must have been properly soaked and ready for pounding ,_,  though not with mortar but by using the pestle to pound the material on a clean flat stone of average size for about three hours ._. After these processes are completed ,_,  the real art of pottery begins ._. 
The Potter will start the building of her pot from the base by making use of the base of the mortar to produce the desired base ,_,  depending on the type needed ._. 
The molded base of the pot will be transferred from the base of the mortar to what is known as Atu ,_,  a pot with a wider opening at the top ._. As the new pot becomes well positioned on the Atu ,_,  it enables the potter mold her pot with ease while bending over the pot ._. 
In this ,_,  the older Potters like Mama Amina exhibit extra dexterity at spinning while the building of the pot progresses ._. 
This makes Atu very essential in the building of a pot because it helps give it the right shape ._. Again ,_,  for any potter to produce a pot that shines and glitters ,_,  the use of egba ,_,  a red pebble dug from the ground must be sought ,_,  pounded and sieved before mixing to beautify the pot ,_,  thereby attracting potential customers ._. When the pots are ready for burning ,_,  the potters will look for adequate pieces of fire wood ,_,  depending on the number of pots to be burnt ._. 
They would then be carefully arranged on the fire wood platform and covered from the top with same size and quantity of fire wood as well as some quantity of hay for sealing up any available opening before setting the pots on fire ._. Ensuring that any opening ,_,  no matter how small is covered is done to avoid leaving an opening for air to get in so as to avoid damages ._. 
Thus ,_,  the pots are made to remain in the fire until all of them turn red signifying they are ready in a process that usually lasts for about 12 hours ._. The pots that turn black instead of red are considered to be damaged products ._. Mama further revealed that there are about 15 types of pots that are being produced in Tatiko ,_,  some out of which are ,_,  Kondo ,_,  Bapwasa ,_,  Kundo ,_,  Jesheko and Shampagwa ._. 
She added that an able -_: bodied potter can produce as many as five pots in a day ._. If the market is good ,_,  the biggest pot is sold at the cost of N3000 while a medium size goes for N 1 ,_, 200 and small size as low as N400 ,_,  she said ._. 
Apart from taking their finished goods to the weekly market in the surrounding communities ,_,  buyers also place orders for them ._. On whether they are enjoying any government assistance ,_,  she said that about 20 years ago government had installed a machine for pottery in their community but owing to poor management the project could not be sustained ._. 
I WAS one of a small minority of white Zimbabweans who had fought the fight to secure equal rights and the vote for the majority in Zimbabwe ._. 
I actually joined the political struggle in 1966 and in April 1980 I found myself sitting on the podium at Rufaro Stadium in Mbare behind the Prime Minister of India and just a few metres from the Prince of Wales and the new Prime Minister of Zimbabwe ._. 
I was there because I had made a small contribution to that moment in time ._. 
It was hugely moving to watch units of the armies that had been involved in the war of Independence ,_,  on the Parade Ground in front of us and a capacity crowd in the stands ._. Next week it will be 34 years since Zimbabwe was created and the Zanu PF Party took power ._. 
Ian Smith governed the country for 16 turbulent years ._. 
The whites had controlled the State since 1923 when Rhodesia had been granted Dominion Status; that is just 57 years ._. 
I think Zimbabwe is now old enough for us to judge how our leadership has done with the mandate they were given in 1980 ._. They took over a country with virtually no debt ,_,  a small but self -_: sufficient economy which was able to sustain a reasonable standard of living for its people ,_,  albeit in a very unequal and skewed manner ._. 
The country had received virtually no external assistance in the previous 60 years ,_,  had been at war with itself since 1964 ,_,  with a real war from 1972 and had been operating under the most severe system of United Nations Sanctions ever mounted by the world community ,_,  since 1967 ._. Mugabe took over a country with a small but honest and efficient administration ,_,  a well -_: educated minority and a people who ,_,  despite all the struggles and conflicts of the past ,_,  had the second highest standard of living in the Southern Africa after South Africa ._. At the same moment in time China emerged from its long night under Mao tse Tung  -_:  its economy was at about the same stage as that of Zimbabwe ,_,  30 per cent urban ,_,  the rural poor in a desperate state with millions dying from starvation each year ,_,  low incomes  -_:  perhaps half that of Zimbabwe and barely able to stand up in the global community ._. 
Isolated and shunned ._. 
Had we adopted the approach taken by Deng Zhao Ping in 1980 it does not matter whether the cat is black or white ,_,  does it catch mice and our economy had grown at 10 per cent per annum for 34 years ,_,  our GDP today would be sitting at over $200 billion ._. 
That is nearly half that of South Africa and Nigeria ._. 
Average incomes would be $17 ,_, 000 a year and we would be approaching developed country status ._. 
We had the potential  -_:  well educated elite ,_,  rich natural resources ,_,  good climate and soils and a large regional market ,_,  as well as open access to world markets ._. Instead we have one of the lowest incomes per capita in the world ,_,  all our social indicators are negative in regional terms infant and maternal mortalities etc and right now we are unable to pay our Civil Service in any kind of decent way ._. 
Our public administration is viewed as one of the most corrupt in the world and is bloated and inefficient ._. 
If we forget what we might have become with different policies to guide our society and just examine what we have done with the resources we did control through the past 34 years then we see an equally dismal story ._. In the first 20 years of our Independence we borrowed over $10 billion from the International Community and the multilateral financial institutions ._. 
We had an open door to very soft loans and by 2000 we had become a heavily indebted Country ._. 
But our record was much worse than that  -_:  I estimate that by 2000 ,_,  we were systematically taking out of our economy a third of GDP in various forms of corruption  -_:  this amounted to billions of dollars ._. Price and exchange controls were used to fleece the private sector and transfer billions of dollars of revenue and income from the private sector to the State ._. 
Inflation from 2000 onwards did the rest and by 2008 ,_,  all savings accumulated from 1896 ,_,  were wiped out ._. 
All Banks and other financial institutions were virtually bankrupt by 2008 and despite inflows of 30 to 40 per cent of GDP from remittances and foreign aid ,_,  the country was unable to feed itself or pay for the most basic services ._. 
The productive sector had shrunk to 30 per cent of what it had been in 1980 ._. 
Zimbabwe was in all economic respects a Failed State ._. 
South Africa ,_,  concerned about the effect that the collapse in Zimbabwe was having on their own society ,_,  moved to try and stop the deterioration in our society and economy ._. 
The result after two years of tough negotiations was the GNU in 2009 ._. 
That brought some sanity and relief with the economy bouncing back strongly from 2009 to 2012 ,_,  only to grind to a halt again in 2013 ._. 
The election results of July 2013 put the whole economy into reverse and by the end of the year revenues to the State were in decline and the banking sector was once again in crisis and unable to pay back its depositors ._. This situation has not improved and the economic situation in the country is again driving the reform and change agenda ._. 
If we do nothing to restore confidence in the State and to engage the International Community and unlock our economic potential very soon ,_,  we are going to be in big trouble by the end of May 2014 ._. Everyone knows that ,_,  but they do not know what to do and the people who have the power and the responsibility are basically incapable of doing the job ._. 
As we have been so often in the past ,_,  we are again in crisis and it is difficult to see how we can get ourselves out of the hole we have dug for ourselves ._. 
Radical measures are needed and it's urgent ._. 
Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State says the question of his party ,_,  All Progressive Congress APC ,_,  zoning the presidency in the 2015 general elections does not arise as the party has no provision for it ._. 
The governor also ,_,  in this interview ,_,  speaks on his running battle with teachers over qualification ,_,  his efforts to address infrastructural deficit in Edo and the National Conference ,_,  among other issues ._. 
Excerpts :_: The last time we heard you ,_,  you said you would never rest until all those responsible for the murder of Comrade Oyerinde Olaitan ,_,  your Principal Secretary ,_,  including the senior police officers allegedly shielding them ,_,  are brought to justice ._. 
What is the situation now ,_,  about one year laterThe last time I spoke on this was at the House of Reps ,_,  almost a year ago ._. 
I understand the House of Reps has released their report in which they advised the police and SSS to harness their findings and hand over the findings to the Edo State Director of Public Prosecution ._. 
That was the last I heard on the issue ._. 
I said everything you attributed to me ,_,  but I also have to recognize that there are things that are beyond me ._. They say may God give you the patience to bear what you cannot change ._. 
I don't have a police force ._. 
I have pushed the matter to the best of my ability ._. 
I have no new card to play ._. 
At this point ._. 
I hand the matter over to God ._. 
I can't do much more than I have done ,_,  but it is a heavy burden in my heart which I have to live with ._. The burning issue right now in Edo State is your effort to reform the educators ._. 
You have rebuilt schools but the people who make good education possible  -_:  the teachers  -_:  you have been having running battles with them over the need to identify the qualified ones among them through competency tests ._. 
Even though the problem is there all over the country ,_,  can you describe the peculiar situation in Edo StateWe have abandoned the idea of competency test for what we now call assessment test ._. 
The basic difference is that we want to assess the teachers in our employment to find out what is the level of their competence ._. 
That way we will be able to establish the level of assistance they require ._. 
For instance ,_,  a man who has a National Certificate of Education NCE but can't teach will be put in the hands of experts to determine the kind of training he requires to make up for his deficiency ._. If he has the knowledge but does not know how to impart the skill ,_,  an appropriate training can be designed ._. 
On the other hand ,_,  if we find that someone was not supposed to be a teacher at all; he is not even educated but somehow ,_,  due to corrupt practices ,_,  either through monetary inducement or political manipulations by successive governments and they were dumped on the system ,_,  such that their weaknesses cannot be cured through training and retraining ,_,  we will decide what to do with them ._. If they cannot be redeployed to other areas where they can be useful ,_,  then they have to give way to others who have what it takes ._. 
We want to understand the nature of the problem besetting education in Edo State ,_,  that is why we call it assessment ._. 
We can help teachers to be upgraded through in -_: service training and refresher courses ._. We need a lot of investment in education because that is the most important infrastructure ._. 
Infrastructure like roads ,_,  hospitals ,_,  electricity ,_,  water  -_:  those are conventional infrastructure that people can see ._. 
The most important infrastructure is human capital ._. 
And the foundation is primary and secondary education ._. I think that is the logic behind compulsory basic education; that every child ,_,  irrespective of his economic circumstances ,_,  should have quality basic education ._. 
If you get the buildings ,_,  the furniture and other things right but the teacher is not competent ,_,  then all that investment will be wasted ._. As I walk round the state ,_,  I often come across young pupils going or coming from school ,_,  most times in company of their parents ._. 
I look at the uniform and realise that it does not belong to one of the government schools ._. 
Some of the m are attending these mushroom private schools ._. 
Some of the schools operate from uncompleted buildings ,_,  no playgrounds ,_,  no sporting ,_,  recreational facilities ._. Then I ask the kid ,_,  why do you like to go to that school' Or sometimes I ask ,_,  'have you seen the government schools ,_,  the red roof schools' They say 'yes' ._. 
'So why are you not attending there' 'My mummy or my daddy said no I should attend this one' ._. 
A couple of times I have had to interview their parents ._. 
They tell me they are happy with the way we have rebuilt the public schools but they are not sure of the teachers ._. Across the country ,_,  everybody recognizes the crisis in the education sector ._. 
It is easy to see the dilapidated school buildings ._. 
What is not easy to see is the quality of the teaching staff ._. 
The result is that every year West African Examinations Council WAEC and other examination bodies announce 70 per cent failure ._. 
And we just move on ._. We are producing children who do not have what it takes to be employable ,_,  or go into the university or polytechnic or even acquire technical education ._. 
You now have educated people who cannot read and write ._. To underscore the problem ,_,  I came across a woman who ,_,  in the course verifying her credentials ,_,  could not read an affidavit ._. 
Instead of I solemnly declare ,_,  she said 1 Solomon ._. 
Instead of Judicial Province ,_,  she said :_:  Onitsha Prophet ._. Judicial starts with J ,_,  yet she was confusing Judicial with Onitsha ._. 
Province is Prophet ._. 
We asked yet another teacher :_:  'how many local governments are there in Edo State ,_,  list some of them' She said :_:  UNIBEN ._. 
UNIBEN is a local government !_. 
I mean ,_,  I don't want to talk about it ._. 
We saw things like these in the process of checking credentials ,_,  and we realised that the problem goes beyond ghost teachers ,_,  or teachers refusing rural postings ,_,  but that there are people parading as teachers who are not ._. We have too many quacks masquerading as teachers ._. 
And the moment I realised this ,_,  it was only natural that I had to find courage to deal with this human element which makes all the difference ._. 
I started meeting with the Nigerian Union of Teachers NUT ,_,  civil society organizations ,_,  we had town hall meetings ._. 
In all these meetings ,_,  civil society ,_,  human rights organizations ,_,  royal fathers ,_,  community leaders ,_,  market women all said yes ,_,  teachers must do this test ._. The more the teachers are hesitant ,_,  the more members of the public are wondering :_:  'why are you refusing to do this' Governance has deteriorated in Nigeria ,_,  and everybody has tried to find his own private solution ._. 
There is no way society can make progress when those who should find solutions to problems are finding solutions to their own personal problems ._. 
Even in the education sector ,_,  if you are rich ,_,  you take your children to US ,_,  UK ,_,  even Ghana ._. If you are poor ,_,  you look for a private school set up in a three -_: bedroom flat ,_,  and if you are too poor ,_,  you are trapped in your poverty ._. 
Everybody should find the courage to confront the problem of bad governance ._. 
Some of our people come to me and say :_:  'you should take it easy with these people because politically they are very sensitive' ._. 
What can be more sensitive than compromising the future of our children You cannot be in government without driving change ._. If our electorate were sensitive ,_,  by the time WEAC results are out and a particular state records 70% failure ,_,  the party in power will never rule again in a long time ._. 
Two weeks ago ,_,  I was in London ,_,  and the debate was that the performance of children in British schools in Mathematics had declined ._. 
The British government was looking in the direction of encouraging Chinese to come and teach Mathematics in British schools ._. Nobody needs to be in government office if he does not have the liver to deal with the problems threatening the future of our country ._. 
My fear for Nigeria is not just the number of unemployed people but the fact that 90% of these people are unemployable ._. 
As our economy gets bigger ,_,  many big industries will be coming up ,_,  but do we have the skilled manpower to fill them So ,_,  I am very passionate about this and I have no choice but to push it to conclusion and damn the consequences ._. Some weeks ago when the assessment test was held ,_,  it was reported that only about 70 teachers were accredited as the rest refused to turn up ._. 
Why do you think teachers are shying away from an exercise aimed at assisting them to get better in their chosen professionThose who know they are not supposed to be addressed as teachers will do everything to block it ._. 
Many fear that they will not pass ._. 
It is not about pass or fail but to see how we can help those who need help ._. 
Many of them turned up but the union officials prevented them from going in to do the test ._. 
There were scuffles in various locations ,_,  and to avoid violence the security agents decided to manage the situation ._. Another thing was this black market injunction which was issued by the President of the Industrial Court ._. 
I use my words carefully :_:  a black market injunction purportedly issued by Justice Adejumo ._. 
Because the court is a creation of the law ,_,  it cannot do violence to the law ._. 
The NUT ,_,  I understand ,_,  had applied for injunction at Akure Division of the court which covers Edo State ._. The judge ,_,  in his wisdom ,_,  asked that the government be placed on notice and fixed a date for hearing ,_,  only for Justice Adejumo ,_,  in Abuja ,_,  in another division of the same court ,_,  to issue another injunction restricting Edo State government from assessing its teachers ._. 
It is so ridiculous ._. 
This purported court order was never served on us ,_,  but I heard that NUT officials photocopied the injunction and were circulating it ._. We have written a petition to the National Judicial Council NJC ._. 
Justice Adejumo cannot turn the Industrial Court to his own instrument that he can use according to his own whims and caprices ._. 
We will see to the end of it ._. 
I have a duty to the Edo child ,_,  to the Edo people ._. 
The responsibility of government is to protect the interest of the public ,_,  particularly when it is clear that if certain things are not done the collective interests of our people will be compromised ._. The bane of our society is that people look at what is politicially convenient ,_,  but I believe in the dictum that a politician looks at the next election but a statesman looks at the next generation ._. What strategies are you employing to overcome the infrastructural deficit of Edo StateWe adopted a programme to open up the state to develop the rural areas and pursue urban renewal ._. 
Lee Kuan Yew says from the airport you make a statement ._. 
I remember when we started to do the Airport Road ,_,  the PDP said it was not viable ,_,  as we would destroy people's homes ._. 
Even a section of the Oba's palace was at the risk of being demolished ._. 
We had to do a couple of things which every governor should do :_:  find courage to remove illegal structures ._. The real challenge was in finding the funds but I have since realised that it is not how much you have but how you manage the little that you have ._. 
Across the three senatorial districts we built roads ,_,  hospitals and connected many areas with modern amenities ._. The PDP in Edo State appears to have reunited its factions and are now saying they will retrieve the state from APC come next election ._. 
What is your reactionPerhaps they think they want to rule a conquered nation ._. 
They underestimate the capacity of the people to resist what they do not want ._. 
I have taken risks to serve this country ._. 
If people want to manipulate themselves into power against the wishes of Edo people ,_,  we will fight; there is no doubt about that ._. 
I know ,_,  as things are today ,_,  PDP cannot win election in Edo State ._. If they are saying they will will use federal instruments to criminally rig elections ,_,  it remains to be seen whether they want to kill all of us or how they want to do it ._. 
For the remaining years of my life ,_,  I will stand on my fight to fight for truth and justice ,_,  as for free and fair elections ,_,  not only in Edo State but the nation at large ._. 
Edo people have accepted the principle of one man one vote ._. 
We launched it here ,_,  and even the President has keyed into it ._. The federal agencies are not PDP agencies ._. 
The uniform of the armed forces are for Nigerians ,_,  not for a political party ._. 
The country is greater than any political party ._. 
I want to tell the old men who use such terms that even though they introduced rigging they should repent because if they die in sin hell will be their portion ._. Does APC believe in zoning of offices like the presidency ,_,  governorship and others If the answer is yes ,_,  then what is the difference between APC and PDPAs far as I know ,_,  there is no provision for zoning in the APC constitution ._. 
And ,_,  therefore ,_,  it means that there is no zoning ._. But it is already widely speculated that the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2015 election will come from the NorthThe way to find out is to look at the APC constitution and see whether there is provision for zoning ._. 
It is not about what the people say or speculate ._. 
In the PDP ,_,  it is in their constitution ._. 
In the APC constitution ,_,  there is nothing like that ._. 
Number two ,_,  the organs where a decision is taken is during a convention where rules are made ,_,  amended or approved ,_,  or at the National Executive Council where major decisions are taken ._. 
To the best of my knowledge ,_,  at no meeting of the organs of the APC have we ever discussed zoning let alone adopting it ._. I know you are not an enthusiast of the ongoing National Conference ,_,  but can you suggest how it can help to reduce the cost of governance in the countryIn Edo State we did not have to do do a state conference in order to be able to increase capital vote or put more money in order to carry out projects ._. 
Nations do not need National Conference in order to restructure expenditure ._. 
When I got to Edo State ,_,  80% of our annual expenditure was for recurrent vote leaving 20% for capital ._. 
Even the quality of the capital vote was a problem ._. 
We decided from day one that we were going to revise it to 60/40 ratio ,_,  60 capital and 40% recurrent ._. I did not need to convene a conference of Edo ethnic nationalities to reduce the cost of governance ,_,  so I do not believe a conference is required to achieve that purpose ._. 
Cost of governance cannot be addressed by a conference ._. 
I am surprised that you think it can ._. 
Cost of governance is not in the rules ._. 
It is in the habit ._. 
It does not require a serious research to establish what is already in the public domain ,_,  namely ,_,  that what is required to maintain a senator the president of the US does not earn it ._. So it is not even the presidential system that is responsible for the high cost of governance in our democracy ._. 
There was this report a couple of years ago which showed that some members of the British parliament made some double claims ,_,  some claimed ten thousand pounds for accommodation and other small expenditures ,_,  and for the British media and public this was a scandal ._. And I remember the Prime Minister ,_,  David Cameron ,_,  saying that any of the members involved would lose their seats ,_,  and they did ._. 
Here we are ,_,  we public office holders have suites in the first class of British Airways ,_,  Air France ,_,  Lufthansa ,_,  Emirates and Qatar Airways ._. 
How we structure our budget is not a function of the style of our government ._. 
This goes into the heart of what we call good governance ._. Is it a party or government of the day that makes this decision Given the number of Ministries ,_,  Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government ,_,  more than 500 of them ,_,  what can a regime really do to pare down the recurrent wage bill unless the constitution devolves power and reduces the size of governmentNo ,_,  no ,_,  no ._.  that is the blackmail element ._. 
The recurrent expenditure is not synonymous with salaries and wages paid to workers who work ._. 
If you analyse the content of recurrent expenditure carefully you will be shocked that wages are not the major problem ._. 
I know for a fact that when we went for conferences ,_,  the Nigerian delegation was and still is the largest ._. And yet when you get to the committee levels ,_,  the Nigerians are not present ._. 
They are all at the various shopping malls ._. 
That was where I learnt one interesting thing about foreign travels ,_,  and why it is a major source of self -_: help in the public service ._. 
If a minister says he is travelling for a conference of three weeks he collects the estacode for three weeks ,_,  he collects the estacode for three weeks ,_,  spends five days and comes back ._. He doesn't need to retire the daily travel allowance he collects ._. 
It is not uncommon to find a man whose salary is N100 ,_, 000 a month ,_,  his estacode is $600 a day ._. 
One day estacode can pay his salary for one month ._. 
If he manages to corner two weeks trip he has earned over a year salary ._. 
It is all part of the recurrent expenditure ._. 
There are all kinds of wastages in the system ._. That's why the most booming industry in Nigeria is seminars and workshops ,_,  and the new thing the public service does is to organise these seminars and workshops through consultants ._. 
Consultancy is the best way to defraud a government because there is no price on the shelf ._. 
It is a willing buyer and a willing seller ._. 
The simple gadget these days is an ipad and a small projector for powerpoint presentation and you can just pick up a million dollars ,_,  two million dollars consultancy ._. 
Wastages in the system go way beyond salaries and wages ._. 
Three well -_: worn parties in Nigeria ,_,  the ACN ,_,  CPC and a wing of the APGA had a makeover ,_,  refashioning themselves as the APC All Progressives Congress ._. 
But the question remains :_:  what exactly is progressive about this marriage Is it not like changing NEPA to PHCN with no improvement in electricityRegressive allianceRather than being a progressive party ,_,  the APC is regressive ._. 
Indeed ,_,  it is a cruel joke to describe it as progressive ._. 
A party led by a former military dictator and a civilian dictator cannot be progressive ._. 
Can any right -_: thinking person actually mistake Buharifor a progressive Would a progressive truncate a democratic government Would a progressive muzzle the press Would aprogressive arrest and jail people without trial Would a progressive call for rioting and bloodletting if he loses an election Certainly not !_. Whatever Buhari might be ,_,  he is not progressive ._. 
Instead ,_,  he is a dyed -_: in -_: the -_: wool antediluvian politician ._. 
At 71 ,_,  he belongs to the old school of Nigerian leaders that see the country in black and white ,_,  North and South ,_,  Muslim and Christian ._. 
Not once ,_,  in all his years in the public eye ,_,  has he uttered an original idea ._. 
Yes ,_,  he has been head -_: of -_: state before ,_,  but it was by force of arms ._. 
Nevertheless ,_,  there is no indication whatsoever that Buhari has any understanding of Economics ._. 
He has never enunciated any kind of economic policy ._. 
As a matter of fact ,_,  he has hardly enunciated any policy whatsoever; beyond making platitudinous statements that he will wipe out insecurity in the country ._. On his part ,_,  Buhari's partner ,_,  Bola Tinubu ,_,  is anything but progressive ._. 
There is nothing progressive about a man who chooses ACN candidates capriciously in his bedroom ,_,  installs his wife as Senator for Lagos State ,_,  and foists his daughter on hapless market -_: women as the Iyaloja of Lagos State ._. 
The biggest indictment of Tinubu as a non -_: progressive is the difference between what he achieved as two -_: term governor Lagos State and what his successor Babatunde Fashola's has achieved ._. 
Undoubtedly ,_,  Fashola has put Tinubu to shame ._. Corruption allianceSometimes in Nigeria to be progressive is regarded as meaning to be against corruption ._. 
Can the APC be said to be an anti -_: corruption party The answer is a capital No !_.  If ,_,  as many people seem to be insisting ,_,  Buhari is sworn against corruption ,_,  then the big question is what is he doing with all the PDP thieves and crooks that are now supposedly crossing the carpet to the APC Even more important ,_,  what he is doing with Bola Tinubu Nobody would accuse Tinubu of being an apostle of anti -_: corruption ._. 
Certainly ,_,  he is not the second -_: coming of Tunde Idiagbon ._. Former EFCC Chairman ,_,  Nuhu Ribadu once described Tinubu as a looter of public funds of international dimensions ._. 
Tinubu was investigated for operating illegally nothing less than 16 foreign bank accounts while serving as Lagos State governor ._. 
His educational credentials are notoriously bogus ._. 
He falsely claimed to have attended a non -_: existent school ,_,  St ._.  Paul's School ,_,  Aroloya; as well as my alma mater ,_,  Government College Ibadan ._. 
He also claimed he attended the University of Chicago ,_,  when he obviously did not ._. Anti -_: democratic partyThe partners in the APC alliance are hostages of their past ._. 
At their marriage ceremony ,_,  they declared their resolve :_:  to form a political party committed to the principles of internal democracy ._. 
Only the gullible and those suffering from amnesia will believe this ._. The ACN is unapologetically anti -_: democratic ._. 
Its leader ,_,  Bola Tinubu ,_,  does not have the word democratic in his dictionary ._. 
Tinubu lost the primaries for the Lagos gubernatorial candidate of the AD Alliance for Democracy in 1999 ,_,  nevertheless ,_,  he got the godfathers of the Afenifere to prevail on the winner ,_,  the late Funso Williams ,_,  to step down for him ._. Bisi Akande has been the party chairman of the ACN forever ._. 
The same goes for party spokesman ,_,  Lai Mohammed ._. 
The ACN avoids national conventions like the plague ._. 
Primaries are not held to determine its candidates for elective offices ._. 
They are selected ,_,  as opposed to elected ,_,  and then imposed on the party ._. 
Indeed ,_,  in a moment of exuberance ,_,  Akande declared that democracy has no place in the internal arrangements of the ACN ._. 
Hear him :_:  Anyone that is not comfortable with that should go and contest in another political party ._. 
Why should anyone now believe that these same dictators have suddenly turned democratic ,_,  simply because it is now convenient for them to sing a different tuneSimilarly ,_,  Buhari's democratic credentials are non -_: existent ._. 
As self -_: imposed Head of State ,_,  Buhari had no regard for human rights ._. 
Immediately he seized power ,_,  he announced that he would tamper with the press ._. 
Soon ,_,  the infamous Decree Number 4 was promulgated which made even the publication of the truth a punishable offence ._. 
Under this cover ,_,  Buhari jailed innocent journalists ,_,  including Tunde Thompson and Nduka Irabo ._. 
He abolished civil liberties ,_,  promulgated retroactive decrees enabling him to kill Nigerians through jungle justice ,_,  proscribed civil society organizations and professional groups and exercised absolute power illegally ._. Mayhem partyAPC leaders burnished their progressive credentials by threatening to throw the entire country into chaos if INEC did not register their party ._. 
Once registered ,_,  they proclaimed their unique definition of progressive by calling on their members in the national assembly to block the passage of the 2014 national budget ._. 
Presumably ,_,  this would have really made Nigeria progress even faster ._. 
The party made the grandiloquent promise to :_:  offer our beleaguered people a recipe for peace and prosperity ._. 
However ,_,  their jaundiced way of achieving this was by undermining the nation's security by asking that new service chiefs should not be confirmed in the Senate ._. Buhari's strange recipe for promoting national peace and prosperity is by ensuring that :_:  the dog and the baboon would all be soaked in blood if APC loses the 2015 election ._. 
That would really be progressive ._. 
When he lost in 2011 ,_,  his progressive supporters went on a rampage ,_,  looting and killing ._. 
Today ,_,  this APC party of peace and prosperity cannot seem to conduct simple ward congresses without violence ._. 
In Ondo State ,_,  one Bosun Adegorola was shot dead and 15 others seriously injured during the APC ward congresses in the state ._. In Ogun State ,_,  two separate APC factions held parallel congresses ,_,  leading to two different executives in all the wards in the state ._. The APC is a ticking time -_: bomb waiting to explode ._. 
It has imported the trouble -_: makers of the PDP into its ranks ,_,  and they have promptly become trouble -_: makers in the APC ._. 
They are now engaged in a battle for supremacy with the older APC members ._. 
In Kwara State ,_,  for example ,_,  older members of the APC are engaged in guerrilla warfare with PDP defector Bukola Saraki ._. 
In Kano State ,_,  daggers were drawn between former Governor ,_,  Ibrahim Shekarau ,_,  and PDP defector ,_,  Musa Kwankwaso ._. 
The upshot of this was the defection of Shekarau to the PDP ._. These fights in APC ranks are duplicated right across the country ._. 
Almost everywhere ,_,  the APC is engulfed in brushfires as theseso -_: called progressives are engaged in a free -_: for -_: all ._. 
Of course ,_,  the biggest of these ridiculously progressive fights is yet to come ._. 
When it is time to choose its presidential and gubernatorial candidates ,_,  this coalition of strange bedfellows can be expected to implode ._. Muslim partyNigeria is a secular state ._. 
The polity maintains a delicate balance between Christians ,_,  predominantly in the South; and Moslems ,_, predominantly in the North ._. 
This has led to the convention whereby if the president of Nigeria is Christian ,_,  the vice -_: president is Muslim; and vice -_: versa ._. 
The formation of political parties on religious lines is proscribed in Nigeria ._. 
Nevertheless ,_,  APC's definition of progressive is one where it is ,_,  to all intents and purposes ,_,  a Muslim party ._. All the timber and caliber of the APC ,_,  occupying the key positions of the party ,_,  are Muslims ._. 
Muhammadu Buhari ,_,  the party's leader from the North ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
So is Ahmed Bola Tinubu ,_,  the party leader from the South ._. 
Bisi Akande ,_,  the National Chairman is Muslim ._. 
Aminu Bello Masari ,_,  the Deputy National Chairman ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
Tijani Musa Tumsah ,_,  the National Secretary ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
Nasir el -_: Rufai ,_,  the Deputy National Secretary ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
Lai Mohammed ,_,  the National PublicitySecretary ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
Sadiya Umar Faruq ,_,  the National Treasurer ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
Shaibu Musa ,_,  the National Financial Secretary ,_,  is Muslim ._. Abubakar Ledo ,_,  the National Youth Leader ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
Muiz Banire ,_,  the National Legal Adviser ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
Bala Jubrin ,_,  the Deputy National Auditor ,_,  is Muslim ._. 
Sharia Ikeazor ,_,  the National Women Leader ,_,  is Muslim ._. In the multi -_: ethnic ,_,  multi -_: religion Nigeria of today ,_,  there is nothing progressive about this ._. 
As a matter of fact ,_,  it is downright retrogressive ._. 
There is no single Christian holding a national office in the APC ._. 
Christians are relegated to the zonal offices ._. 
Forexample ,_,  Tom Ikimi is the National Vice -_: Chairman ,_,  South -_: South; while Otumba Niyi Adebayo is National Vice -_: Chairman ,_,  South -_: West ._. Muslim/Muslim ticketWhen Buhari conducted his progressive coup d'�tat in 1983 ,_,  overthrowing an elected democratic government to become head of state ,_,  his deputy ,_,  Tunde Idiagbon was also a Muslim ._. 
Worse still ,_,  both of them were Fulani given the fact that Idiagbon's mother was Fulani ._. 
This fake progressive agenda is yet again in the offing ._. 
The party is testing the water and is already in crisis because of the determination to field Buhari as presidential candidate and Tinubu as Vice -_: Presidential candidate ._. This kite of a Muslim/Muslim ticket will not fly in the Nigeria of today ._. 
People argue that it worked in 1993 ,_,  when a Muslim/Muslim Abiola/Kingibe ticket prevailed ._. 
However ,_,  2015 is not 1993 and Buhari is not Abiola ._. 
Abiola was educated in Christian schools and he endeared himself to virtually all strands of Nigerian society with his generosity ._. 
Buhari ,_,  on the other hand ,_,  is known to be a rabid Muslim who has uttered many anti -_: Christian statements in the past until it now becomes necessary to seek Christian votes in the quest for political power ._. The mere notion of a Muslim/Muslim ticket is already tearing the makeshift fabric of the APC apart ._. 
Should the party remain bullish in this regard ,_,  the Christian hewers of wood and drawers of water within its ranks can be expected to declare :_:  To your tents O Israel !_. 
Already ,_,  turncoats like Femi Fani -_: Kayode are already making plans to ditch the new -_: fangled party over this very issue ._. 
The naira traded flat against the United States dollar yesterday as dealers said lenders sold dollars on the interbank market to improve liquidity and shore up the weakening local currency ._. The naira had initially weakened to N161 ._. 30 in mid -_: day trade before some lenders started to sell the greenback on behalf of offshore clients participating in the bond market ,_,  Reuters said ._. In addition ,_,  the local unit of Addax sold $10 million ._. 
The move helped the naira recover to close flat at N161 ._. 05 ,_,  compared to last Friday's close of N161 ._. We don't expect any major move in the naira this week as demand slows and offshore dollar flows into the market ,_,  one dealer said ,_,  noting that the unit could trade around N160 -_: N161 ._. 50 throughout the week ._. The naira has hovered around N160 ._. 90 -_: N161 over the past week with renewed interest from offshore investors in Nigeria's debt ._. Also ,_,  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation sold large amounts of dollars to increase liquidity ._. Meanwhile ,_,  Brent crude oil rose more $1 ._. 50 yesterday as Western powers considered tougher sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine ,_,  while U ._. S ._.  crude rose modestly after positive retail sales data signaled a rebound in the American economy ._. According to Reuters ,_,  several European Union foreign ministers threatened Moscow with new sanctions and France's foreign minister said the group could hold an emergency summit next week if there is no breakthrough in talks involving Russia ,_,  Ukraine and the United States that are scheduled for Thursday ._. 
Brent prices rose by as much as $1 ._. 79 after the Pentagon announced a Russian fighter aircraft made repeated low -_: altitude ,_,  close -_: range passes near a US ship in the Black Sea over the weekend ._. US retail sales logged their biggest gain in March ,_,  the latest sign the economy is accelerating after its weather -_: induced winter slumber ,_,  lending support to US crude oil prices ._. Brent's premium over US crude oil narrowed on Friday to $3 ._. 28 ,_,  its tightest point since September 20 ,_,  causing sell -_: off pressure in US crude ,_,  analysts said ._. 
The spread was last trading at $4 ._. 76 ._. Investors awaited fresh economic growth data from China ,_,  the world's second -_: biggest oil consumer ._. In a Reuters' poll ,_,  economists forecast that growth slowed to 7 ._. 3 percent in the first quarter from 7 ._. 7 percent in the final quarter of 2013 ._. 
This would be the slowest pace of growth in five years and near the minimum needed to ensure stable employment
The police on Tuesday arraigned four security guards in a Wuse Zone 2 Senior Magistrates' Court Abuja ,_,  for negligent conduct ._. The accused persons are Emmanuel Essien ,_,  32; Tarfa Gade ,_,  37; Hamza Adamu ,_,  27 ,_,  and Emmanuel Udofia ,_,  33 ,_,  all attached as guards to Brains and Braces Ltd ,_,  Djibouti Crescent ,_,  Wuse 2 ,_,  Abuja ._. The prosecutor ,_,  Cpl Francis Tanko ,_,  told the court that on April 6 ,_,  Mr Boluwati Adetayo ,_,  Marketing Manager of the company ,_,  reported the accused at the Wuse Zone 3 Police Station ._. He said that Adetayo had reported that on same day ,_,  the accused persons connived and negligently abandoned their duty post ,_,  allowing armed robbers to invade the premises ._. According to Tanko ,_,  at about 5 a ._. m ._.  ,_,  the armed robbers who were six in number ,_,  broke into the company's office and stole a TV and a DVD player valued at N169 ,_, 000 ._. Tanko informed the court that the robbers also stole a black Hilux Vehicle with Registration number YAB 637 JK which had since been recovered from them ._. He said that the offence was contrary to sections 79 and 196 of the Penal Code ._. If found guilty ,_,  they are liable to six months imprisonment or with fine or both ._. The accused pleaded not guilty to the offences ._. The Judge ,_,  Mrs Binta Dogonyaro ,_,  granted them bail for N100 ,_, 000 each with one reasonable surety each must reside within the court's jurisdiction ._. She said that the sureties must swear to an affidavit of means and deposit their passport photographs to the court's registry ._. Dogonyaro adjourned the case until May 20 ,_,  for hearing ._. 
I AM one of a small minority of white Zimbabweans who fought to secure equal rights and the vote for the majority in Zimbabwe ._. I joined the liberation struggle in 1966 and in April 1980 I found myself sitting on the podium at Rufaro Stadium in Mbare behind the Prime Minister of India Indira Ghandi and just a few metres from the Prince of Wales Charles and the new prime minister of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe ._. I was there because I had made a small contribution to that moment in time ._. It was hugely moving to watch units of the armies that had been involved in the war of Independence on the parade ground in front of us and a capacity crowd in the stands ._. Tomorrow it will be 34 years since Zimbabwe was created and the Zanu PF party took power from the white settler colonial regime ._. Ian Smith governed the country for 16 turbulent years ._. The whites had controlled the state since 1923 when Rhodesia now Zimbabwe was granted Dominion Status; that is just 57 years ._. I think Zimbabwe is now old enough for us to judge how our leadership has done with the mandate they secured in 1980 ._. They took over a country with virtually no debt ,_,  a small but self -_: sufficient economy which was able to sustain a reasonable standard of living for its people ,_,  albeit in a very unequal and skewed manner in favour of the white minority ._. The country had received virtually no external assistance in the previous 60 years ,_,  had been at war with itself since 1964 ,_,  with a real war from 1972 and had been operating under the most severe system of United Nations sanctions ever mounted by the world community since 1967 ._. Mugabe took over a country with a small but honest and efficient administration ,_,  a well -_: educated minority and a people who ,_,  despite all the struggles and conflicts of the past ,_,  had the second highest standard of living in southern Africa after South Africa ._. At the same moment ,_,  in time China emerged from its long night under Mao Tse Tung  -_:  -_:  its economy was at about the same stage as that of Zimbabwe ,_,  3% urban ,_,  the rural poor in a desperate state with millions dying from starvation each year ,_,  low incomes  -_:  -_:  perhaps half that of Zimbabwe and barely able to stand up in the global community ._. 
Isolated and shunned ._. Had we adopted the approach taken by Deng Zhao Ping in 1980 it does not matter whether the cat is black or white ,_,  does it catch mice and our economy had grown at 10% per annum for 34 years ,_,  our GDP today would be sitting at over US$200 billion ._. 
That is nearly half that of South Africa and Nigeria ._. Average incomes would be US$17 000 a year and we would be approaching developed country status ._. 
We had the potential  -_:  -_:  well educated elite ,_,  rich natural resources ,_,  good climate and soils and a large regional market ,_,  as well as open access to world markets ._. Instead ,_,  we have one of the lowest incomes per capita in the world ,_,  all our social indicators are negative in regional terms infant and maternal mortalities ,_,  etc and right now we are unable to pay our civil service decently ._. Our public administration is viewed as one of the most corrupt in the world and is bloated and inefficient ._. If we forget what we might have become with different policies to guide our society and just examine what we have done with the resources we did control through the past 34 years ,_,  then we see an equally dismal story ._. In the first 20 years of our Independence we borrowed over US$10 billion from the international community and multilateral financial institutions ._. We had an open door to very soft loans and by 2000 we had become a heavily indebted country ._. But our record was much worse than that  -_:  -_:  I estimate that by 2000 ,_,  we were systematically taking out of our economy a third of GDP in various forms of corruption  -_:  -_:  this amounted to billions of US dollars ._. Price and exchange controls were used to fleece the private sector and transfer billions of dollars of revenue and income from the private sector to the state ._. 
Inflation from 2000 onwards did the rest and by 2008 ,_,  all savings accumulated from 1896 had been wiped out ._. All banks and other financial institutions were virtually bankrupt by 2008 and despite inflows of 30 -_: 40% of GDP from remittances and foreign aid ,_,  the country was unable to feed itself or pay for the most basic services ._. The productive sector had shrunk to 30% of what it was in 1980 ._. 
Zimbabwe was in all economic respects a failed state ._. South Africa ,_,  concerned about the effect that the collapse in Zimbabwe was having on its own society ,_,  moved to try and stop the deterioration in our society and economy ._. The result after two years of tough negotiations was the Government of National Unity in 2009 following Zimbabwe's sham presidential run -_: off of June 2008 ._. That brought some sanity and relief with the economy bouncing back strongly from 2009 to 2012 ,_,  only to grind to a halt again in 2013 ._. The election results of July 2013 put the whole economy into reverse and by the end of the year ,_,  revenues to the state were in decline and the banking sector was once again in crisis and unable to honour obligations to depositors ._. This situation has not improved and the country's economic situation is again driving the reform and change agenda ._. 
If we do nothing to restore confidence in the state and engage the international community to unlock our economic potential urgently ,_,  we are going to be in big trouble by the end of May ._. Everyone knows this ,_,  but the people who have the power and the responsibility are basically incapable of doing the job ._. 
As we have been so often in the past ,_,  we are again in crisis and it is difficult to see how we can get ourselves out of the deep hole we have dug for ourselves ._. 
Radical measures are urgently needed ._. We were all so hopeful that this year we would have something to celebrate other than empty memories of past liberation war achievements and sacrifice ._. The reality is that we have nothing to celebrate ._. 
We have failed our people and for all those who had so much hope for Zimbabwe ,_,  it is a sad day ._. The BBC is showing a short clip of Mugabe speaking about Zimbabwe's natural resources and saying that we will never again allow foreigners to control our land and our minerals ,_,  and then being saluted by securocrats ._. That sums it up for his regime ,_,  empty rhetoric and pride ._. 
He needs to be reminded that his cat does not catch mice ,_,  never did and will not do so in the future ._. It is time to change the cat; it might be the only way forward ._. Cross is the MDC -_: T MP for Bulawayo South and writes in his personal capacity ._. 
Abuja � Peace remains a common denominator for the growth and development of any Country in the world ._. As global investments eludes Middle East and Asia ,_,  Africa remains the only option ._. 
Nigeria is the most populous black nation in the world with abundant mineral resources which make her an irresistible market for global investors ._. 
The threats that disrupts the peaceful co -_: existence of the an amalgamated nation of hundred years with over 170 ,_, 000 million citizens are been propagated by extreme vices from sea pirates in the south ,_,  kidnappers in the east ,_,  cybercrime in the west and boko haram in the north ._. Only one state has recorded a high level of sanity and peaceful co -_: existences and that is Akwa Ibom State ._. 
This gives a more compelling reason for the Peace Ambassador Agency to honour the first lady of the State  -_:  Chief Mrs ._.

The Fidelity SME Forum is a weekly radio programme organised by Fidelity Bank Plc to educate ,_,  inform ,_,  advise and inspire budding entrepreneurs in Nigeria with knowledge and expertise that will enable them build sustainable businesses ._. 
The interactive radio programme features experts and entrepreneurs as guests weekly to share their success stories ._. 
In this interview ,_,  the President/Chief Executive Officer ,_,  Beloxxi Industries Limited ,_,  Mr ._. 
Obi Ezeude highlighted the requirements to be a successful business ownerWhat is your business about We manufacture cream crackers called beloxxi cream crackers ._. 
That's basically what we do ._. How did you start The company was founded in 1994 as a trading company and i started importing business from Malaysia under another brand ._. 
But eventually that brand became very popular in Nigeria and eventually the then president of the country ,_,  president Olusegun Obasanjo banned importation ._. With that ban ,_,  did you now shift your focus to local production Yes ._. 
But before the ban ,_,  I was really tired of importing ,_,  but you know a lot of people will be discouraging you from local production ._. 
They say it is not profitable ,_,  its very difficult and you cant match cost and quality ._. 
But when the ban came ,_,  it was really an impetus for one to get into manufacturing and really do something creative and sustainable in the economy ._. Does your product match what you were getting in Malaysia in terms of quality What I am doing now is really far better than what I was getting in Malaysia in terms of quality ._. How did you achieve that My recipe was designed in Italy and I perfected it in South Africa ._. 
I wasn't interested in making a local product; I was only interested in making international products in Nigeria ._. 
There is really no shortcut to it ._. 
If you really want to do something ,_,  you just have to do it very well ._. 
I export to Ghana ,_,  Sierra Leone and Angola ._. 
It's the same story of quality and superiority everywhere ._. How did you ensure that amidst the challenges ,_,  you remained competitive with the international brand There's really no problem in terms of cost in Nigeria ._. 
I don't know why people exaggerate the problem of cost in this country ._. 
The labour in Nigeria is very cheap ._. 
In terms of power that people talk about ,_,  we generate our own power ._. 
There's a technology out there called by -_: fuel firing ._. 
You can use 70 per cent neutral gas ,_,  three per cent diesel and generate your own power ._. 
It is almost 55 per cent cheaper than PHCN ._. 
So what is the story aboutAt end of the day ,_,  if we don't sit down and tackle our problems ,_,  it will never end ._. 
If we like ,_,  we can talk about the problem from now to a million years ,_,  but if we don't take a concrete step to tackle it ,_,  then it will still be there and our people will still be unemployed ._. Our problem when you talk about manufacturing in Nigeria is what I would like to refer as self defeatism ._. 
China has shown the whole world that you can actually develop your own economy by creating a manufacturing sector and a very strong one at that ._. 
If you create that with your large population ,_,  and a lot of them gain employment ,_,  then you create savings automatically ._. 
And from the saving ,_,  banks will have funds to lend out to people that want to make investment ._. 
At the end of the day ,_,  the economy will grow on its own ._. 
So that basically is the way we see it as entrepreneurs ._. Where is your company today ,_,  in terms of production In 2005 when we started in Ikeja ,_,  we had 325 workers and it was just a single line ._. 
By the time we built our Agbara factory ,_,  we expanded to more than 800 workers and that was with just two lines ._. 
Today ,_,  we have three huge lines with 1 ,_, 611 workers producing over 22 ,_, 000 metric tons of biscuits ._. 
We produced about 15 million cartons in a year ._. In 2010 when the president came to commission our factory in Agbara ,_,  I did make it categorically clear to him that the success of our business should not be measured by the terms of turnover  ,_,  rather it should be measured by the number of young Nigerians we've been able to give jobs ._. Every member of staff of the company was a first timer in every job they've ever done ._. 
Our factory workers are fresh graduate from secondary school ._. 
We don't employ professional factory workers ._. 
We train them and make them understand that factory work is not a profession ._. 
So they must make irreversible commitment to go to school ._. 
All the graduates we have are all fresh graduates ._. 
They've never worked anywhere ._. 
So that's basically what we try to do ._. In my speech that day ,_,  I told the president that I didn't invite him because I was the most connected Nigerian ,_,  rather he accepted to come and see what young Nigerians have been able to achieve despite the obstacles and impediments ._. 
It should be a lesson for the rest of the country ,_,  because if you look at the population that is most endangered in terms of unemployment ,_,  it is mostly those between 15 and 30 years ._. How did the idea of company come to you Basically ,_,  after my training in business school ,_,  I came back in Nigeria and spent some time analysing the economy ._. 
Anywhere you have large population of young people ,_,  pastry business globally tend to do very well ._. 
So I carried out studies of what was happening in the market ._. 
So we went to markets ,_,  did a little bit of analysis ,_,  saw all the imported European biscuits ._. 
So what I did was to contact some of my friends in Asia ._. 
Everybody was importing from London and Europe and I know that the labour cost in Europe is very high ,_,  and so there prices will be very expensive ._. 
And then ,_,  the crackers biscuit they were doing was actually the old design called fermented crackers ._. So I decided to look towards Asia where they make a unique but different kind of crackers ._. 
So I decided to introduce that into Nigeria and that was a strategic move that was really a game changer ._. What have been your challenges The greatest challenge we have ,_,  believe it or not ,_,  is access to long -_: term funding ._. 
In manufacturing ,_,  if one has long -_: term funding ,_,  then they can generate their own power and also create the infrastructure that they need to start ._. 
The greatest problem is not the infrastructure itself ,_,  but the availability of long -_: term funding in the economy ,_,  that will enable entrepreneurs to create this infrastructure ._. Did you show a track record of your dealing as a company while trying to access funds from the banks Yes ,_,  but sometimes I don't understand what most people mean by track records ._. 
As an entrepreneur ,_,  you have to first of all have a good idea and you have to be able to convince people that things are going to work ._. 
If you have all the track records in this world and you don't have a good idea or even sound convincing ,_,  then nobody will be able to give you money ._. How did you raise your first capital It was just the money I saved a bit ,_,  then the others I got from my relations and my father ._. 
The beautiful thing was that it was in the days of Gen ._. 
Ibrahim Babangida where you have to bid ._. 
In those days ,_,  most people were buying money in black market but people like us as small entrepreneurs didn't have much to even buy at a higher rate ._. 
So we decided to queue up and bid ._. It was good in the sense that with little naira ,_,  you get more dollar if you bid ,_,  so I opted to bid ._. 
By the time the goods came into Nigeria ,_,  they had blocked the wharf for those people that were doing black market ._. 
So what happened was that the whole market dried up ._. How can you describe your experience with fresh graduates that you employ Nigerian graduates are very brilliant ._. 
I don't even believe that the school has anything to do with this because you are talking about the mindset of the individual and the character of the person ._. 
What we also do in the company is that we don't hire people that we know ._. All our adverts are open and we don't put our company name ,_,  so that I won't start getting calls from people telling me to employ their kids or relations ._. 
Everybody in the company got there on merit and when they get there on merit ,_,  we try to sit down as colleagues and not like the servant -_: master scenery ._. 
FORMAL sector unemployment is very high ,_,  companies are closing down ,_,  the economy is teetering on the brink ,_,  we don't have a national currency and corruption is running riot in high offices ._. 
That is the state of Zimbabwe on Independence Day ._. Are we independent From what To do what What is there to celebrate on Independence day Thirty -_: four years on ,_,  are we in any way different from the rest of Africa or are we the worst of the lot In short ,_,  is there hope for ordinary Zimbabweans What mark would those who paid the ultimate price to liberate this country give us for what we have becomeLet me state plainly that corruption and general mismanagement in Government -_: linked enterprises and local authorities have done a lot to discredit the image of our liberation war heroes ._. 
This is quite separate from deliberate distortions and misinformation about the motives for the land reform and economic empowerment programmes which seek to directly benefit the poor ._. Beyond the short -_: term ,_,  I should proudly say we have tried to be different and more inclusive economically ._. The general narrative about Africa is that the continent has regressed since the advent of independence ._. 
It is not unusual to hear some disillusioned Zimbabweans shouting that we were better off under Smith ._. 
GDP figures are always readily available to buttress these often misleading claims ._. 
Sadly ,_,  a majority of those who revel in this researched nostalgia have no clue of whose welfare is covered under those glowing GDP figures ._. 
They can't explain why it would then have been necessary for someone with a university degree to opt to go to war than simply get a job ,_,  buy a house in the suburbs ,_,  buy a car and marry ._. All said ,_,  these protest messages reflect our current lived reality :_:  the impatience to enjoy ,_,  the self -_: indulgence about what we don't own or produce ,_,  the love for the transient ,_,  lack of appreciation for the spirit of sacrifice for the greater good and our search for the elusive glamour of Hollywood as gleaned through the flat screen ._. It reflects the life of greedy and ostentatious opulence we see around us ,_,  much of it unaccounted for ._. Yet it is arguable that as Africans we have generally been like apologetic about our independence ,_,  often treating it as if it were a gift ,_,  more an accident of history than a call of destiny ._. 
We have refused to make a clean break with colonialism ,_,  imperialism and its capitalist tentacles which make it nearly impossible for an independent African state to act as such :_:  standards ,_,  norms and best practice are established for us ,_,  so that anything different is sinful deviance ._. 
We have to toe the line ._. The result has been predictable since Ghana's independence in 1957 ._. 
We all repeat the same development formula and expect a different result ._. 
We remain forever beholden to the mother country on how things should be done ,_,  even where it's clear it's not working ._. We are a rich continent with the poorest people on earth ._. 
Our resources are not ours ,_,  our economic policies are not ours ,_,  what we produce in our mines and fields is not ours; we are only good as employees of companies owned by sons and daughters of the former colonial power ._. 
We can't manage ourselves ,_,  hence the need always for international best practice ,_,  international protocols and conventions to be adhered to; instruments drafted by Europeans to address specific ,_,  immediate ,_,  practical circumstances but are being hawked as universal truths for adoption ._. 
We have to be told who and how to define our own heroes even ._. To a certain degree ,_,  Zimbabwe has dared to be different  -_:  -_:  being able to assert its independence against mighty odds ,_,  although still unsure and not curious enough to know what we are worth ._. 
We have bucked the trend ,_,  the given ,_,  the accepted  -_:  -_:  development models which measure national progress and prosperity only in terms of GDP growth rather than the overall income distribution and the well -_: being of people ._. 
Zimbabwe decided to throw away the whiteman's independence jewel which shorn in Harare and Bulawayo's CBDs and lush commercial farmers ,_,  and has opted to have a majority of its people as direct creators and owners of an envisioned new jewel ._. 
Thousands of our people didn't go to war to return to be mere labourers in a free Zimbabwe !_. Zimbabwe's historic break came with the land reform programme ._. 
That on its own should be a source of immense pride ,_,  having been the motive force for the liberation war ._. And that decision courted swift retribution ._. 
It was unprecedented and likely to set a bad example ._. 
It had to be punished as a warning ,_,  never mind that the bitterness came cloaked in the garb of human rights ,_,  rule of law and property rights and the penalty as targeted sanctions ._. 
Indigenisation just rubs it in ._. We would be supremely naive to lower our guard yet ._. 
The masters of this colour -_: coded universe don't forgive and never forget ._. 
Never mind that our sins are of their own invention :_:  that we can't own even that which is God -_: given within the geographical boundaries which colonialism demarcated for us ._. Beyond the idea of taking back land ,_,  Zimbabwe's other break was the madness of the methodology ._. 
Many attempts at land reform in most countries have foundered on this ._. Zimbabwe decided the best methodology was one which won the war ,_,  after losing patience with the willing seller ,_,  willing buyer approach which made it almost impossible for our people to ever get the best arable land ._. What is needed now is to raise productivity so that we are food self -_: sufficient ._. 
It might take time; our farmers still require massive hand -_: holding by Government ._. 
Rome was not build in a day ._. Reports indicate that we are backward by way of mechanisation ._. 
About 30 000 tractors are needed and we currently have less than half of that ._. 
People are always short on seed ,_,  fertiliser ,_,  irrigation and chemicals ._. 
Those who abuse Government assistance must be severely punished ,_,  including losing the farms ._. 
It's part of the war ._. The main source of bitterness among our people is lack of employment opportunities ,_,  poor service delivery in water and electricity ._. 
Resources have been a key limiting factor in the implementation of Zim Asset although it is downright malicious for anybody to expect a Government policy which requires resource mobilisation to start manifesting results just eight months after adoption ._. 
But then people lose faith when they see rampant corruption going unpunished while they are told their plight has to do with sanctions ._. 
Why should sanctions affect only the poorest in societyGovernment's community share ownership schemes are an initiative which is beginning to be appreciated where the policy is being implemented like the Zimplats' Mondoro -_: Ngezi -_: Chegutu -_: Zvimba ._. 
There will always be sceptics ,_,  cynics and political naysayers as was the case with the land reform ._. 
The cynicism is justified when the share ownership schemes are launched with fanfare by the president only to be followed by endless controversy such as the Zimunya -_: Marange share ownership project ._. People have reason to suspect that somebody is eating on their behalf without their authority ._. 
Communities must benefit directly from their natural resources ._. In the urban areas ,_,  capitalism's lost decade has yielded a lot of opportunities for enterprising and resourceful retrenchees ,_,  most of whom have set up shop in most high density suburbs producing a variety of furniture items ,_,  some of which is sold in major shops in town ._. 
They are the core of SMEs where reputedly about $7 ,_, 4 billion is in circulation ._. 
Reports indicate that there are 2 ,_, 8 million small businesses in the informal sector employing about 5 ,_, 7 million people ._. I think it is ,_,  however ,_,  premature for Government to start thinking about taxation ._. 
These little industries are the future and need to be nurtured ,_,  given support and appropriate infrastructure to grow ._. 
Their owners need to be organised and trained in marketing and managerial skills to leapfrog them into the formal sector ._. 
They need time to grow ,_,  improve their products ._. 
Government should help them find markets ._. I don't believe individually there is more tax to be made there than what is siphoned from the formal sector through corruption ._. While our bookish economists are full of admiration for the size of the South African and Nigerian economies ,_,  just like they were of Rhodesia's enclave economy ,_,  what is obfuscated are the staggering levels of poverty ._. 
Whose economy are we admiring when black South Africans don't own the resources which fuel that economy and don't benefit from it Can we read anything from the rolling strikes which have crippled the gold and platinum minesWhat's the import of Nigeria's economy overtaking South Africa's if 112 million Nigerians out of a population of 168 million live in squalor Are we not better with a broader economy where rural and A1 farmers make more money per tobacco selling season than some urban employees earn in a yearThe economic models which post -_: colonial Africa has pursued have the hallmark of structural adjustment programmes without the IMF and have all failed to alleviate poverty ._. No doubt we have huge blotches in the quality of education ,_,  health ,_,  housing delivery and there is massive urban decay in infrastructure consistent with unplanned post -_: independence migration and increased traffic ._. 
However ,_,  for me the biggest failure is our inability to forge a shared vision ,_,  to end unnecessary political polarisation which has served to create a negative sentiment of political instability and a high country risk for would -_: be investors ._. 
The opposition has been totally anti -_: people on this ,_,  opposing every pro -_: poor policy just to get western financial backing ._. As Zimbabwe celebrates 34 years of Independence ,_,  we need to ask ourselves whether the current wave of corruption cases spurred on by a spirit of heartless gluttony are consistent and consonant with the selfless sacrifices for which so many lost their youthful lives ._. 
While Government has embarked on a number of policies to improve the welfare of ordinary Zimbabweans ,_,  is this the best we could have done Do our actions ,_,  individually and as a collective ,_,  do honour or discredit the virtues which inspired the liberation struggle for this countryCan we justify to our departed heroes why we can't enjoy the pride of having a national currencyThis is a time for reflection ,_,  soul -_: searching and personal introspection ._. 
There is a Shona saying; nyadzi dzino kunda rufu ,_,  but it looks like Zimbabwe is the only country where that saying doesn't apply ._. 
Thieves ,_,  murderers ,_,  rapists ,_,  crooks and the corrupt can be exposed and still refuse to die ._. Politicians can sell off their birthright for political power and still relevant ._. We dared to be different about our independence; we need virtues which go with that trajectory ._. 
FORMAL sector unemployment is very high ,_,  companies are closing down ,_,  the economy is teetering on the brink ,_,  we don't have a national currency and corruption is running riot in high offices ._.

There is a Shona saying; nyadzi dzino kunda rufu ,_,  but it looks like Zimbabwe is the only country where that saying doesn't apply ._. 
Thieves ,_,  murderers ,_,  rapists ,_,  crooks and the corrupt can be exposed and still refuse to die ._. 
Politicians can sell off their birthright for political power and still relevant ._. We dared to be different about our independence; we need virtues which go with that trajectory ._. 
Today we suspend our Epistles to Confab Delegates to turn to something hot off the press  -_:  Africa Report No ._.  216 from the Brussels ,_,  Belgium -_: based International Crisis Group ,_,  ICG Thursday April 3 ,_,  2014 ,_,  the Group released its Curbing Violence in Nigeria II :_:  The Boko Haram Insurgency ._. 
The 62 -_: page report ,_,  issued from its headquarters in Brussels and simultaneously from its Africa Regional Offices in Abuja ,_,  Dakar and Nairobi ,_,  contains a detailed Executive Summary and some far -_: reaching Recommendations to the Nigerian Government ._. 
Excerpts of the Summary and Recommendations are the only two sections this Column can accommodate because of space constraints ._. 
The Column is grateful to Brother Aminu Inuwa Muhammad for the alert on the report ._. 
For the full report ,_,  go to ICG's website or email Brother Aminu ._. There are two reasons why this Report is considered important :_:  one ,_,  since the ICG is considered a relative neutral party in this crisis ,_,  it may be expected to be unbiased in its observations even though ,_,  like any other organisation ,_,  it may have its own interests; and two ,_,  it may happen that ,_,  because of our limitations ,_,  the governments Federal and Northern States and agencies security and military that are addressed by the Report's Recommendations may not notice the report or act on it in good time ,_,  it may be worthy to draw their attention ._. EXCERPTS FROM ICG'S EXECUTIVE SUMMARY :_:  Boko Haram's four -_: year -_: old insurgency has pitted neighbour against neighbour ,_,  cost more than 4 ,_, 000 lives ,_,  displaced close to half a million ,_,  destroyed hundreds of schools and government buildings and devastated an already ravaged economy in the North East ,_,  one of Nigeria's poorest regions ._. 
It overstretches federal security services ,_,  with no end in sight ,_,  spills over to other parts of the north and risks reaching Niger and Cameroon ,_,  weak countries poorly equipped to combat a radical Islamist armed group tapping into real governance ,_,  corruption ,_,  impunity and underdevelopment grievances shared by most people in the region ._. Boko Haram is both a serious challenge and manifestation of more profound threats to Nigeria's security ._. 
Unless the federal and state governments ,_,  and the region ,_,  develop and implement comprehensive plans to tackle not only insecurity but also the injustices that drive much of the troubles ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  or groups like it ,_,  will continue to destabilise large parts of the country ._. 
Yet ,_,  the government's response is largely military ,_,  and political will to do more than that appears entirely lacking ._. Most Nigerians are poorer today than they were at independence in 1960 ,_,  victims of the resource curse and rampant ,_,  entrenched corruption ._. 
Agriculture ,_,  once the economy's mainstay is struggling ._. 
In many parts of the country ,_,  the government is unable to provide security ,_,  good roads ,_,  water ,_,  health ,_,  reliable power and education ._. 
The situation is particularly dire in the far north ._. 
Frustration and alienation drive many to join self -_: help ethnic ,_,  religious ,_,  community or civic groups ,_,  some of which are hostile to the state ._. It is in this environment that the group called Boko Haram usually translated loosely as Western education is forbidden by outsiders emerged ._. 
It is an Islamic sect that believes corrupt ,_,  false Muslims control northern Nigeria ._. 
The group and fellow travellers want to remedy this by establishing an Islamic state in the north with strict adherence to Sharia Islamic law ._. In May 2013 ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan declared an emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa states and deployed additional troops that with the help of vigilantes drove Boko Haram from most cities and towns ._. 
He also established a committee to negotiate a settlement with its leadership ,_,  with little success ._. 
On 18 March 2014 ,_,  National Security Advisor Mohammed Sambo Dasuki announced a soft approach to addressing the root causes of terrorism ,_,  but it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented ._. The movement ,_,  never very hierarchical ,_,  is more dispersed than ever ,_,  with many leaders in the Adamawa mountains ,_,  Cameroon ,_,  and Niger ._. 
Its isolated leader ,_,  the violent Abubakar Shekau ,_,  probably has little daily control over cells ,_,  and it is fragmenting into factions ,_,  including the relatively sophisticated Ansaru ,_,  which focuses more on foreign targets ._. 
Able to move fairly freely ,_,  these groups are unlikely ever to be completely suppressed ,_,  unless the government wins local hearts and minds by implementing fundamental political reforms to address bad governance ,_,  corruption and underdevelopment ._. 
Insecurity in much of the north may also worsen political violence and undermine the credibility of the 2015 elections ,_,  further damaging government legitimacy ._. ICG'S RECOMMENDATIONS :_:  To ensure greater human security in northern Nigeria ,_,  better protection from Boko Haram attacks and a more law -_: abiding ,_,  better resourced ,_,  professional security service; and to switch from a mainly military approach to the challenge from Boko Haram ,_,  and radicalism in general ,_,  to one more attuned to root causes :_:  -_: To Nigeria's Federal Government :_:  Discontinue heavy -_: handed military and police methods that risk pushing yet more restless ,_,  jobless and frustrated youths into violence and extremism; Begin to address impunity and a main Boko Haram demand by completing prosecution of the police officers alleged to have extra -_: judicially executed Mohammed Yusuf; and investigate and prosecute crimes allegedly committed by the security services ,_,  government officials state and federal and Boko Haram members; Recognise that unless issues of bad governance and systemic corruption are addressed vigorously and transparently ,_,  all other measures will be nothing but stop -_: gaps; Free up the necessary national resources to address sustained economic hardship ,_,  rising inequality and social frustration by expanding and strengthening the anti -_: corruption agencies ,_,  and ensure they work effectively at state and local levels ,_,  free of political manipulation; Begin to tackle the root causes of growing radical Islamic and ethnic militancy by fully developing and implementing a Far North Development Commission ,_,  similar to the Niger Delta Development Commission ,_,  with a mandate that includes coordinating anti -_: desertification campaigns ,_,  developing large -_: scale irrigation ,_,  agriculture ,_,  power and road projects and promoting small businesses that could create jobs for youths; and do so in a transparent ,_,  consultative and accountable manner; Take steps to change the climate of secrecy and fear around radical Islam by encouraging greater public discussion on the causes of and ways to address radicalism; Accredit senior ambassadors and defence attach�s to all neighbouring countries and meet with them frequently to review the domestic and transnational security situations ._. To state governments in the north :_:  Work with northern political ,_,  traditional and religious elites to disarm ,_,  de -_: radicalise and re -_: integrate Islamist militants; Reform the Qur'anic educational system by introducing a dual curriculum as in Kano and paying teachers' salaries so as to relieve pupils of the need to beg for their upkeep; Use the Northern Governors' Forum to set high standards of transparent and accountable state governance ._. To Nigeria's international and regional partners :_:  Continue to build bi -_:  and multinational security ties and networks in the region; Intensify mixed patrols at Nigeria's borders to curtail the movement of armed groups and criminals; Share and exchange intelligence information on a more regular basis; Support programs at all levels of government that address poverty ,_,  youth unemployment and women's lack of empowerment; Encourage and support the federal government to genuinely implement a national policy of zero tolerance for corruption; Encourage the federal government to work with northern political ,_,  traditional and religious elites toward a political solution to the Boko Haram problem ._. 
Officials in Italy say suspected Boko Haram gunmen have kidnapped two Italian priests and a Canadian nun in northern Cameroon ._. Authorities say the abduction happened during the night between Friday and Saturday near the Nigerian border ._. Kidnappings of Westerners have become common in the remote and sparsely populated region ,_,  where borders between countries are porous ._. The priests abducted overnight were identified as Giampaolo Marta and Gianantonio Allegri from the Vicenza diocese in northeastern Italy ._. The identity of the nun was not immediately clear ._. 
Abuja � Presentation by the Borno -_: Yobe People's Forum at the World Press Conference on the Crises in the North East Held on 31st March 2014 at Barcelona Hotel ,_,  AbujaIntroductionWe welcome you to this World Press Conference called by the Borno -_: Yobe People's Forum ,_,  a non -_: partisan and non -_: religious association of concerned citizens from Borno and Yobe States ._. 
The Forum is compelled by the continuous upsurge in the insurgency in the north -_: east to call this press conference ._. ____________________________________________________________________ Borno -_: Yobe Elders Allege Complicity of Security Agencies in Boko Haram Attacks ____________________________________________________________________In the last one month ,_,  Kawuri ,_,  Konduga ,_,  Izge ,_,  Bama ,_,  Michika ,_,  Buni Yadi ,_,  Mafa ,_,  Mainok ,_,  Jakana ,_,  Auno ,_,  Shuwa ,_,  Madagali ,_,  Malari ,_,  Wajonkoro ,_,  Ajigin ,_,  Benishiekh ,_,  Gamboru ,_,  Kalabalge ,_,  have been attacked with heavy civilian casualties ._. 
In the Giwa military Barracks attack ,_,  there has been a loss of over one thousand lives as stated in the current Amnesty international report ._. 
Rather than abate ,_,  the insurgency has not only continued to escalate but has become more daring ._. The continuous bloodletting has led to the loss of over 17 ,_, 000 lives ._. 
Official statistics released by the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA ,_,  revealed that over three million people have been displaced by the insurgency and terrorists attacks in the affected states of Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa in the first three months of 2014 alone :_:  Borno 1 ,_, 304 ,_, 393; Adamawa 1 ,_, 086 ,_, 126 and Yobe 771 ,_, 368 ._. Most of the victims are women ,_,  children and the elderly ._. 
These developments underscore the urgent need for the Government ,_,  the International Community ,_,  as well as all Nigerians to arrest the brewing humanitarian crises in the area ._. It is to be noted that while the various incidents have been given wide publicity ,_,  the real human sufferings remain unknown and under -_: reported ._. For the past 2 -_: 3 years ,_,  farmers in the affected areas could not access their farms ._. 
This coupled with the deliberate scorched earth tactics employed by the insurgents ,_,  the lack of food ,_,  water ,_,  electricity ,_,  shelter and inability to pursue any kind of gainful employment have resulted in the systemic destruction of the economies of the affected areas and the psyche of the people ._. It is encouraging that in recent weeks the entire nation has risen in unison in condemning the senseless killings and wanton destruction of lives and properties ._. 
It is equally encouraging that Government is reviewing its approach in handling the insurgency ._. ObservationsAs widely reported in the media ,_,  both indigenes and non -_: indigenes ,_,  Muslims and Christians ,_,  mosques and churches ,_,  men ,_,  women and children ,_,  as well as security personnel have NOT been immune to the violent bloodletting ,_,  arson and wanton destruction of lives and property ._. 
All these are happening despite the existence of a two -_: term state of emergency in the area ._. The alleged involvement of foreign nationals ,_,  specifically the arrest of Cameroonian nationals that led to the discovery of a cache of arms as well as gunmen who are not indigenous to the area of the insurgency have given rise to a lot of unhealthy speculations and conspiracy theories about the crisis as being stoked by yet to be known persons/forces ._. The dropping of arms ,_,  ammunitions and attackers by helicopters as reported in the media and as discussed on the floor of the Senate under -_: score the urgent need for government to investigate and un -_: mask the sponsors of terror and bring them to justice ._. While the Defense HQ in Abuja has acknowledged these shocking allegations and said investigations were on -_: going ,_,  it is important that the issue is concluded with utmost urgency and the outcome made public to restore people's confidence ._. It is perplexing that despite a subsisting two -_: term state of emergency in the area and restoration of telecommunication services ,_,  distress calls from the people to the security agencies remain unanswered for up to eight hours as reported in the case of Bama attack and as revealed by the Shehu and also by teachers of the Federal Government College Buni Yadi where the lives of 59 young students were cut short ,_,  among several others ._. It is no secret that today people in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States and indeed most parts of the Country are confused by the lack of prompt response to cry for help during attacks ._. It is very worrisome that as the insurgency in the North East is escalating ,_,  the once relatively peaceful states of Katsina ,_,  Benue and Kebbi are experiencing serious killings and social dislocations ._. 
It is the considered opinion of the Forum that unless government takes urgent steps to arrest the situation ,_,  the whole of the North may be engulfed in a serious security crises ._. 
The possible repercussions of not taking action to arrest the situation are best imagined ._. Questions Needing Urgent AnswersThe Borno -_: Yobe People's Forum is seeking urgent answers to the following questions :_: 1 ._. 
Who authorized the withdrawal of security personnel from the Federal Government College ,_,  Buni Yadi hours before the attack that claimed the lives of 59 innocent children2 ._. 
Why were security reports from the communities on impending attacks ignored or not promptly responded to3 ._. 
How were the insurgents able to attack the Maiduguri Air -_: force Base and de -_: mobilize as well as burn planes and other military installations despite the existing state of emergency and curfew in the town4 ._. 
Are the authorities unaware of helicopters dropping arms and ammunition ,_,  food and medical supplies to areas well -_: known to be strong holds of the insurgents5 ._. 
How could 20 to 30 Toyota Hilux vehicles move in a convoy freely with a subsisting curfew and still go undetected6 ._. 
How did a little band of rag -_: tag misguided youths metamorphose into a well kitted ,_,  well armed killing machine moving freely in convoy of vehicles and supported by helicopters ._. 7 ._. 
How did the Shilka Tank ,_,  a multipurpose self -_: propelled anti -_: aircraft artillery weapon positioned to secure Giwa barracks fail to function resulting in heavy loss of lives ,_,  both civilian and military as widely reported in the media8 ._. 
Why was the Late General Mohammed Shuwa ,_,  a civil war hero ,_,  killed despite the presence of a military detachment in front of his home9 ._. 
What is the status of persons abducted by the insurgents in various places in the North East10 ._. 
Who are the instigators of online media campaigns of calumny stirring ethno -_: religious intolerance in the country11 ._. 
Are we dealing with fifth columnists in this crises12 ._. 
Why have the various reports on the crises not been implemented by the Government What happened to the 2009 Report of the NSA ,_,  CDS ,_,  IGP and CDI ,_,  the Ambassador Usman Gaji Galtimari and the Barrister Tanimu Turaki Presidential Committee ReportsEnough is enough !_. 
Enough of the bloodshed ,_,  enough of the destruction ,_,  enough of the dislocations and upheavals ,_,  enough of insecurity ,_,  enough of unanswered questions ._. Recommendations :_: The Borno -_: Yobe People's Forum recommends as follows :_: 1 ._. 
In line with section 142b of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which states that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government ,_,  the Federal Government should comprehensively address the security and welfare of citizens in the affected areas ._. 
Government must do everything possible to arrest the senseless destruction of lives and properties ._. 2 ._. 
The current state of emergency which expires on the 19th of April ,_,  2014 should not be extended because it did not serve the purpose for which it was invoked ._. 
This will enable the state governments to use their meager resources for the re -_: construction of the states as well as the rehabilitation and reintegration of our people ._. 3 ._. 
Government should un -_: mask the sponsors of the Boko Haram insurgents and any other groups and persons that are involved in the insurgency in the North East ._. 
As has been previously recommended by the Northern Elders Forum ,_,  Government should probe the genesis of the crises with particular regards to those who master minded ,_,  encouraged or financed it ._. 
The full wrath of the law should be brought to bear on those found guilty ._. 4 ._. 
Government should thoroughly investigate human rights abuses including alleged extra judicial killings ,_,  maiming ,_,  tortures ,_,  rapes and abductions that may have been committed during the insurgency from 2009 to date ._. 5 ._. 
Government should expedite the trial of the security agents that were implicated in the extra judicial killings of Mohammed Yusuf and others which precipitated the crises and has been used to justify the insurgency ._. 6 ._. 
Government should secure all borders ,_,  especially our borders with Cameroon ,_,  Chad and Niger ,_,  to arrest the influx of mercenaries ,_,  arms and ammunitions into Nigeria ._. 7 ._. 
Government should investigate the violation of the Nigerian airspace in which helicopters were alleged to be dropping arms in Birnin Gwari ,_,  Benue as well as the North East ._. 8 ._. 
The Federal and State Governments in the affected areas should re -_: strategize and secure all schools and colleges in the area ._. 
There must be a deliberate effort to keep our children in school ._. 
To do otherwise will not only exacerbate the educational backwardness of the states but may not augur well for the future of our children and country ._. 9 ._. 
The two billion Naira budgeted for the North East Initiative is grossly inadequate ._. 
Government should establish a special intervention fund for the re -_: construction and re -_: habilitation of the zone as well as re -_: integration of the people affected by the crises ._. 10 ._. 
We urge the International community ,_,  the United Nations ,_,  International Non -_: Governmental Organizations NGOs ,_,  bi -_: lateral and multi -_: lateral agencies ,_,  Civil Society Organizations and people of means to join in the task of re -_: building the States affected by the insurgency and by giving succor to the over three million people affected by the crises ._. 11 ._. 
Government should repatriate Nigerian refugees in Chad ,_,  Niger ,_,  and Cameroun and take immediate measures to rehabilitate ,_,  reintegrate and compensate them ._. 12 ._. 
Government should provide safe corridors to access the affected States to deliver relief from both local and international sources ._. 13 ._. 
We urge both the Federal and State Governments to provide well equipped and adequately staffed Medical Centers to cater for the large number of casualties ._. 
These should also include Trauma Centers to treat physical trauma as well as counseling victims for psychological trauma ._. 14 ._. 
We urge the Federal Government to implement the recommendations of the Ambassador Usman Gaji Galtimari and Barrister Tanimu Turaki Presidential Committees ,_,  and to revisit the 2009 Report of the NSA ,_,  CDS ,_,  IGP and CDI ._. 
It is the considered view of many commentators that ,_,  had the latter Report been implemented ,_,  the insurgency would have been largely contained ._. The Forum wishes to seize this opportunity to appeal to members of Boko Haram to sheath their swords and dialogue with the authorities to find long lasting solutions to whatever grievances they may have ._. In conclusion ,_,  the Borno -_: Yobe People's Forum wishes to place on record its gratitude and appreciation to the Nigerian security agencies and the Civilian JTF who have put their lives on the line ,_,  in serving the nation ._. 
We also wish to place on record our appreciation to the international community ,_,  Civil Society Organizations ,_,  Women groups ,_,  the Media both national and international and all well meaning Nigerians for their concern and quest for a just resolution to the crises ._. Last but not the least ,_,  the Forum wishes to place on record its appreciation to the Governors of Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States for courageously and stoically standing with our people despite the hydra headed challenges including their personal safety and security ._. Ladies and gentlemen of the press ,_,  we thank you for attending this press conference and urge you to remain undeterred in the quest for the truth and in resolving the crises in the North East ._. Thank you ._. 
Members of the deadly Boko Haram sect have killed seven travelers along the Maiduguri -_: Biu ._. 
The outlawed sect was alleged to have laid siege on the road on Saturday when its members killed seven persons ,_,  forcing many motorists to avoid the Maiduguri -_: Biu highway and some other major highways leading into the troubled town ._. It was gathered that after the sect killed the unsuspecting travelers ,_,  they also stormed Gwargube ,_,  an adjoining village to the road where they were alleged to have summoned the villagers and threatened them to cooperate or be killed ._. 
Some developments in the continuing saga of uncontained terror visited on Nigeria by the Boko Haram terrorists are becoming frightening ._. 
They indeed need to be carefully evaluated as their implication may call for a better apprehension of our predicament ,_,  and thus the ordering of a more adequate responsibility in our conduct ._. One has often wondered ,_,  to begin with ,_,  how correct is the term insurgency ,_,  as applied to the situation in the Northern parts of the country ._. 
My dictionary identifies that description more with riot ,_,  uprising or a situation which involves an upheaval among the people of an area within one another ._. It becomes a civil war when it implicates the entire populace while ,_,  on the other hand ,_,  it is war ,_,  plain and simple ,_,  if it is an attack inflicted by other elements though comprising some of the natives themselves ._. The latter is what seems to be happening ,_,  although it might have taken off originally among the natives of a certain section of the country ._. 
But there is a lot of evidence that the motivating spirit and personalities are foreign to this country ._. For one thing ,_,  it is most unlikely that the enormous amount of money required for the arms and the funds demanded by the logistics ,_,  are generated within Nigeria ._. 
The source of these expenses should have been on the front burner in the efforts to combat this evil force right from the beginning as it was suggested by many people on many occasions ,_,  but the idea did not appear to catch the fancy of those in charge of the investigations immediately ,_,  or it should not have taken so long before we hear anything positive in that direction ._. It is all the same disturbing ,_,  very disturbing ,_,  to learn that some strongholds of the Boko Haram are being refurbished with supplies by helicopter ._. 
It is a deposition that is mind boggling ._. 
In fact ,_,  one might have credited such a statement to a deranged person had it not been made by personalities that could never be associated with a lunatic proposition ._. The leader of the group is no other than a former Chief of Air Staff ,_,  Air Vice Marshall AI -_: Amin Dagash Retd ._. 
The revelation was made at a press conference in Abuja early this week ,_,  at which were also present a former Minister of Finance ,_, Mallam Adamu Ciroma; a former Secretary to the Federal Government ,_,  Ambassador Babagana Kingibe;Shetima Mustapha ,_,  an elder statesman ,_,  and other political figures and opinion makers in Bornu and Yobe States ._. 
They were grouped under the identity of the Political Elders Forum from the two States which are both in the centre of the Boko Haram storm ._. 
But they were not just belching out hot air because ,_,  as very knowledgeable and directly affected citizens ,_,  they asked a few worrying questions ,_,  like :_: ltem :_: How were the insurgents able to attack the Maiduguri Air Force Base and demobilise as well as burn planes and other military installations despite existing state of emergency and curfew existing in the townItem :_:  How could 20 to 30 Toyota Hillux vehicles move in a convoy freely with subsisting curfew and still go undetectedItem :_:  How did a little band of rag -_: tag misguided youths metamorphose into a well -_: kitted ,_,  well -_: armed killing machine ,_,  moving freely in convoys of vehicles and supported by helicoptersItem :_:  How did the Shilka Tank ,_, a multi -_: purpose ,_,  self -_: propelled anti -_: aircraft artillery weapon positioned to secure Giwa Barracks ,_, fail to function ,_, resulting in heavy loss of lives of both civilian and military as widely reported in the mediaItem :_: Are the authorities unaware of helicopters dropping arms and ammunition ,_,  food and medical supplies to area well known to be stronghold of the insurgentsItem :_:  Are we dealing with fifth columnists in this crisisWell ,_,  what can we say Major -_: General Chris Olukolade ,_,  the Defence spokesman ,_,  has warned -_:  -_: threatened -_:  -_: to make anyone pay dearly for making statements that are considered untoward to the military war effort ._. 
None of the rhetorical questions above could be said to be complimentary to the total effort against the Boko Haram ._. 
But the calibre of the speakers promptly dismisse any misgivings about their motives ._. 
They are genuinely patriotic ,_,  more so since they are in the heat of the situation ._. 
If this is war ,_,  not a mere insurrection as we have frequently pointed out on this page ,_,  have we really got our act togetherOther aspects of this crisis indeed give cause for anxiety with regard to its conduct ,_,  and that is without prejudice to our appreciation of the gallantry and bravery of the armed forces ._. 
There appears to be lack of direction in support of what is a single purpose ,_,  that is ,_,  the eradication of the Boko Haram menace ._. 
In relation to this ,_,  we may ask ,_,  should the President of our nation be engaging openly in a nauseating blame game with State Governors over who is responsible for the mess we are inIt is time we stopped searching for a peg on which to hang the dilemma of the predicament in which we have found ourselves ._. 
It would be a time -_: consuming and profitless enterprise ._. 
The cause may have sociological or economic roots ,_,  as many have suggested ._. 
It may be because of our evident neglect of planning a good future for our youth ._. 
It may be all of that and more ,_,  or a combination of other factors ._. 
But the question now is how do we put this horror behind us without creating others in its placeA good approach would be to dismiss distractions ._. 
Okay ,_,  I know it has been said before ,_,  but it will bear repeating ._. 
Nothing will be said here from now on about the staging of the preposterous show titled ,_,  The National Conference ._. It would be merely adding to the preposterousness of the mirthless comedy ._. 
Now that so many of our eminent men and women are already on the gravy train ,_,  we shall just have to wait until the bread wagon rolls to a stop ._. 
In the meantime ,_,  it may be very difficult not to ask some of these questions ._. 
And here is the last one for now :_:  Is the issue of the Boko Haram considered inimical to the unity and progress of the nation enough to for it to be an item on the agenda of the National Conferencedis na we kontryThe discovery was made in Soka off the Lagos -_: lbadan Expressway ._. 
An enclave of unmitigated dreadfulness established for the sole purpose of slaughtering human beings and dismembering the cadavers for sale ,_,  had apparently been functioning there for an appreciable period ._. The unfortunate victims were kidnapped ,_,  sometimes cruelly tortured and then ruthlessly disposed of ,_,  while the hapless relatives pined for their return in vain ._. 
Investigation ,_,  to employ a new cliche in the market ,_,  is on -_: going ._. When one has recovered from the shock of the story ,_,  and that takes a while ,_,  the truth then gradually sets in :_: we are in Nigeria ._. Look ,_,  a newly -_: married man cannot operate his little fan because there was no electricity supply ,_,  like the rest us ,_,  in his house ._. 
However ,_,  he has a generator ,_,  like many of us these days ._. 
But fuel is hard to find except on the black ._. 
How for do So he gets five litres for one hundred -_: and -_: twenty naira per litre and goes home to his honey ._. 
They put on the generator ,_,  switch on the fan and everything is fine  -_:  -_:  except that the gen is in an enclosure at the back of the house and the fumes have no means of escaping ._. Neither does the young man who sleeps on into the arms of untimely death with his pregnant wife and a younger relation ._. 
In Port Harcourt where it happened ,_,  they will tell you ,_,  That na Naija ,_, fara !_. 
Soko ,_,  an off -_: shoot of Nigeria's busiest highway ,_,  on the outskirts of one of Africa's largest cities ,_,  is the scene of one of the most barbaric human butchery imaginable ._. 
That is Nigeria for you ._. And what would anyone want with the dismembered parts of a human corpse As if you did not know ._. 
Affluence ,_,  of course !_. 
Juju or black magic that is reputed to be capable of procuring immense wealth ,_,  and business or other forms of successes in a variety of endeavours ._. 
Don't ask me if it works ._. 
Just look around Soka and you would know that you are in the middle of a booming factory of skulls ,_,  and limbs ,_,  and genitals -_:  -_: the dismembered carcases tell it all ._. If it did not work ,_,  there would not be so much patronage ._. 
There should therefore be no high hopes for finding out more about this inhuman criminal enterprise since investigations find progress a challenging ordeal in the face of affluence and influence ._. 
May God rest the souls of all who have been banished from life through this route ._. 
Who knows how many others remain undiscovered ._. 
This is our country ,_,  Nigeria ._. Timeout ._. 
Penultimate Friday ,_,  the Federal Government inaugurated a new board for the Nigeria National Merit Awards ,_,  NNMA ,_,  with Professor Francis Idachaba as Chairman ._. 
The Board is saddled with the responsiblity of ensuring that the right people are nominated and honoured by the Goodluck Jonathan administration which pursues promotion of merit ,_,  hardwork and intellectuallism in the nation's quest for sustainable development ._. Established in 1979 ,_,  the primary objective of NNMA according to Act 59 of 1979 was to confer the Nigerian National Order of Merit ,_, NNOM ,_,  on Nigerians who through intellectual and academic attainments have contributed to national and global developments in the fields of science ,_,  technology ,_,  medicine ,_,  humanities ,_,  arts and other fields of human endeavours ._. 
At least ,_,  that was what the Secretary to the Federal Governnment said during the inauguration ._. 
It therefore means that Nigerians cannot buy this great honour and there would not be short -_: cuts and easy ways in the dispensation of the awards ._. Nigeria as a copycat might have copied this from other countries which bestow similar honours on their citizens ._. 
Nigerian National Merit Awards might have been fashioned after Britain's Member of the Order of British Empire ,_,  MBE which recognises distinguished service to the arts and sciences ,_,  public services outside the Civil Service and work with charitable and welfare organisations of all kinds ._. 
In Britain ,_,  like I stated sometime in this column ,_,  the MBE is perceived as the humblest of honours unlike in Nigeria where our National Honours could become something that people lobby for and use for settlement of political associates ,_,  cronies ,_,  and sychophants ._. 
These days ,_,  National Awards which ought to be awards of distinction could be bought by political cronies and those that merit it could also be dropped for political reasons ._. 
The depth of character unswayed by material attraction and superficial rewards which should be the most considered could become the least considered ._. 
Persons of low pedigree ,_,  political jobbers and crooks could be nominated for what ought to be a mark of distinction ._. 
This should be watched out for so that in future ,_,  only the visionary ,_,  the courageous and patriots should get nominated and honoured ._. 
That way ,_,  this national embarrassment of turning down such awards by people in the mold of Gani Fawehinmi ,_,  Prof Chinua Achebe and Prof ._.  Wole Soyinka would be avoided ._. 
We should build up to the point that credible Nigerians should no longer reject national honours because such awards appear to be going to every Tom ,_,  Dick and Harry ._. Typically ,_,  many would give anything to have such honours bestowed on them but the NNMA board should avoid a situation akin to what played out during the centenary awards where Nigerians raised their voices at awards given to perceived undeserving individuals ._. We keep making the mistake of not drawing a line between national awards and presidential awards as both seem to be used interchangeably ._. 
Presidential awards should be awarded by a president to his friends ,_,  praise -_: singers and political allies while national awards in the mold of NNMA belong to the nation and are given on its behalf ,_,  by the President ,_,  using the guidelines and criteria set by law ._. According to the books ,_,  every nation has a system of recognising and rewarding the outstanding feats and achievements of its citizens ._. 
Such recognition and rewards place on record ,_,  public appreciation for the contributions of those citizens who have distinguished themselves in their services to the nation ._. 
These are also instruments for motivating the wider citizenry to strive for greater heights and to contribute more actively towards promoting the nation's intellectual ,_,  creative and societal value systems ._. The Nigerian Government ,_,  over the years ,_,  instituted several categories of honours and awards that are conferred on Nigerians who have distinguished themselves in various fields of endeavour ._. 
A few weeks ago ,_,  Centenary Awards were given to many ._. 
The Nigerian National Merit Awards should therefore honour Nigerians from all walks of life who have rendered special and outstanding services in their various callings ,_,  to the benefit and progress of the nation ._. 
The Act establishing NNMA empowers the President of the Federal Republic to make provisions for the award of honours and decorations ._. Nominees are usually invited from different professional bodies and the final decision on the awards is however largely left to the discretion of the President ,_,  and the only criterion should be meritorious and distinguished service ._. But this selection process has been bastardized over the years ._. 
Undeserving elements have been nominated by some of these bodies for the awards and many of such nominees have been rewarded ._. Last year ,_,  during the National Honours Awards ,_,  many personalities from Nollywood ,_,  the Nigeria film industry ,_, were given awards for their excellent performances that gave the country positive projection beyond our national borders ._. 
Actors like Olu Jacobs ,_,  Kanayo ._. 
O ._. 
Kanayo ,_,  Chinedu Ikedieze ,_,  Patience Ozokwor and others were given well -_: deserved awards that could hardly be questioned ._. 
But there are awards given to some people that do not deserve to be there in the first place ._. 
Such people believably have not made any significant contributions to national development to warrant being given any recognition at all ,_,  let alone the nation's treasured awards ._. 
When incompetent personages make the list ,_,  and in some cases bag the awards ,_,  the meaning of the national award is devalued ._. In the past ,_,  some security personnel were given national awards and many Nigerians questioned the justification for such ,_,  especially since Nigeria came under the siege of Boko Haram insurgents who have taken some parts of the North hostage ._. Everything appears wrong with it to these Nigerians ._. 
There have also in the past been situations in which some of the top level recipients of certain awards were arraigned for corruption and some even jailed for looting public funds entrusted in their custody ._. 
Whose role models are such holders of national awards Are recipients of national awards or honours not supposed to serve as role models in the societyOne should not therefore wonder why the national awards in recent times have attracted serious criticisms especially on the account of the personality of individuals that were honoured and why many eminent Nigerians who were nominated repeatedly rejected same ._. For instance ,_,  renowned Nigerian literary icon ,_,  the late Professor Chinua Achebe rejected the offer of national honour by the Nigerian government citing then the chaos in his own state ,_,  Anambra where he said a small clique of renegades ,_,  openly boasting of connections in high places ,_,  seemed determined to turn his homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom ._. 
He flayed the brazenness of this clique and the silence ,_,  if not connivance ,_,  of the Presidency ._. 
That was 2004 ._. In 2008 ,_,  human rights lawyer ,_,  Chief Gani Fawehinmi SAN ,_,  rejected the national award conferred on him saying a government that covertly and overtly encourages corruption has no honour in its arsenal of power to dispense honour ._. 
Fawehinmi rejected the honour because of what he described as government's lacklustre fight against corruption and said there was no hope in sight for the decadent socio -_: economic situation affecting the people in the country ,_,  emphasizing that Nigeria was not in the atmosphere for national awards ._. A member of the House of Representatives ,_,  Femi Gbajabiamila in 2011 also rejected a national award for similar reasons ,_,  citing misgovernance and the proliferation of names of men of questionable integrity and people who cannot be said to have merited the honours as part of the reasons for turning down the award ._. Nigeria can do without such embarrassment from her citizens in future and the next NNMA is the time to get it right ._. 
Sixteen years ago when Joseph ,_,  now 39 ,_,  graduated from the University with second class upper ,_,  he looked very promising even with his charming skills and the business acumen he had acquired during his undergraduate years in the university ._. He had to pay his fees from the menial jobs he did every time during academic break ,_,  ready to explore the world of opportunities available ._. President Jonathan and Emeka Nwogu ,_,  Minister of Labour and Productivity ._.  while at the the background job seekers scramble for few job opportunities ._. He didn't wait a bit in search for job ._. 
Rather ,_,  he started a business with the little resources he could gather ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  five years after ,_,  his business efforts became moribund after fire razed the building where his business was situated ._. 
He lost everything he had laboured for ._. 
He was hopeful ,_,  dusted his credentials and joined millions of job seekers in search of employment ._. After a couple of years when none was forthcoming ,_,  he applied for employment in the Nigeria Immigration Service ._. 
Sadly ,_,  he could not live to tell his own story as he died few hours after he wriggled himself out of the venue as a result of the stampede that killed 18 others ._. With the story of the Ph ._. D holders applying as drivers in Dangote companies still fresh in our memories and now the death of 20 vibrant youths as a result of a stampede that occurred during the Nigeria Immigration Service ,_,  NIS ,_,  employment saga ,_,  it shows that all the measures to check the scourge of unemployment have defied all logic by successive governments ._. The percentage of labour force that is without job is alarming while the army of the underemployed and unemployed youths are frightening ._. 
Authorities have put the figures of the unemployed at 23 per cent representing about 20 ._. 3 million Nigerians who are currently jobless ._. The matter is compounded daily as more higher institutions churn out fresh graduates to add to the already saturated labour market ._. Except for the bourgeoisie ,_,  there is no Nigerian household that does not have at least one unemployed university or polytechnic graduate still searching for job ._. 
A few of those who responded to questions on this issue indicated that unemployment has frustrated a number of youths and graduates into finding other means of survival no matter how menial ._. Adedoyin ,_,  a Masters degree student ,_,  University of Lagos finds himself operating the popular Okada in Lagos ._. 
He said :_:  I am a graduate of Geography ,_,  from Bayero University ,_,  Kano ,_,  and after my Youth service ,_,  I could get any job ._. 
I tried to help myself by taking up a teaching job in one of the private schools ,_,  but even as the salary was meagre ,_,  the payment was irregular ._. 
I found out that operating okada as business is a lot better ._. 
Seven months after starting the okada business ,_,  I was able to enroll for my Masters degree at UNILAG ._. Adedoyin maintained that the recent ban on the Okada is now taking its toll on him as he had to join other job seekers to get a job ._. 
He lamented the way employment consultancy companies take advantage of the unemployment situation to extort money from helpless unemployed Nigerians ._. There are many employment consultancy companies that I have paid a lot of money to thinking they will help ._. 
But it had never worked ._. The absence of social security and paucity of basic amenities have not helped matters either ._. 
Quite a number of industries have closed shop in Nigeria since the last five years ._. Adedayo Oyebanji ,_,  an employer of labour in Lagos said the inability of government to fix electricity in the last ten years has resulted to many companies closing shops and raised the level of unemployment ._. 
So many companies ,_,  conglomerates ,_,  have relocated to neighbouring countries with smaller markets and potentials but with friendlier business environments and they are doing well there ._. Go to Ghana ,_,  some of the industries that relocated from Nigeria to Ghana are doing well ._. 
These days ,_,  the high cost of doing business is enough compelling reason for their relocation ._. 
There are very bad roads ,_,  poor electricity supply ,_,  multiple taxation ,_,  among others ,_,  Oyebanji said ._. On the argument that government is not an employer of labour; that the duty of government is to create the enabling environment that would help the private sector create jobs ,_,  Oyebanji said that even in its duty of creating the right environment for the private sector to flourish ,_,  governments at all levels have failed ._. 
He cited the incessant power outage ,_,  the threatening security situation ,_,  corruption in high places as well as unfriendly policies of the CBN ._. On the increasing trend of disinterest by job seekers in highly labour -_: intensive works such as agriculture ,_,  factory work or creative business ideas in preference for white collar jobs ,_,  Oyebanji said these are some of the reasons for remaining in the labour market for a long time ,_,  adding that there is no clear cut direction by the leaders and politicians since many of them engage in ostentatious living to spite and oppress those who don't have ._. This according to him is one of the reasons for the get -_: rich -_: quick syndrome by the younger generation who apart from not getting the desired job ,_,  search for other means to survive ._. 
This to a large extent had given rise to the menace of the Yahoo boys ,_,  Blackberry boys ,_,  Area boys ,_,  Boko Haram and other ethnic militia groups in the country ._. 
Many of these graduates may eventually be recruited into the rank of oil theft syndicates ,_,  armed robbers ,_,  kidnappers ,_,  militants and insurgents ,_,  while their female counterparts may end up as prostitutes ._. The security challenges in the country caused by incessant attacks by insurgents in the North and kidnapping in the South are part of the numerous causes of unemployment in the country ._. 
To reduce unemployment in the country ,_,  the individuals concerned ,_,  the private sector and governments at all levels must put in place creative measures to stem the tide ._. If the argument that the present generation have wasted a lot of time searching for jobs to better their lives and with the increase in the level of unemployment ,_,  the youths of today who will be parents in their mid life years may have been severely wounded by this problem ._. Under this condition ,_,  it is doubtful how they can propel the needed wheel of development ._. 
If young people are provided with employment opportunities ,_,  they can become productive assets and take their part in mainstream society offering the best of their skills and talents ._. 
The last notable Christian -_: Christian ticket was Awolowo -_: Umeadi in 1979 and the last notable Muslim -_: Muslim ticket was Abiola -_: Kingibe in 1993 ._. 
You can figure out the rest ._. 
But let the optimists know that reality always trounces wishful hope in political contests ._. 
Chief Femi Fani -_: Kayode's advice that we get real must be directed where it truly belongs  -_:  to the leadership of the APC -_:  Chief Kayode Samuel ,_,  Facebook ,_,  29th March 2014 ._. I thank my brother Kayode Samuel for his contribution and I shall take his advice and direct my counsel to the leadership of the APC and to the Nigerian people in general ._. 
That is the purpose of this essay and so important is the subject matter under consideration that I would urge as many as possible to find the time to read it from the beginning to the end ._. Chief Akin Osuntokun ,_,  the Bashorun of Oke -_: Mesi ,_,  the former Special Advisor to President Olusegun Obasanjo and the highly celebrated columnist for Thisday Newspaper is one of my closest brothers and friends even though we tend to disagree on virtually everything ._. 
He is a very complex and interesting person who has a penchant for speaking the bitter truth ._. 
He is blunt to a fault and brutally frank and he manages to give as good as he gets in any argument ._. I respect him immensely for a number of reasons ,_,  one of them being his unquestionable loyalty to his friends regardless of their circumstances ,_,  political views and party affiliation ._. 
Simply put ,_,  he is capable of maintaining a good relationship even with those that he disagrees with politically ._. 
I say this because most of Akin's friends like Mallam Nuhu Ribadu ,_,  Alhaji Kashim Imam ,_,  Mallam Uba Sani ,_,  yours truly and a host of others have left the PDP yet we still meet virtually every other night as a group and slug out politics and current issues ._. Even though Akin is invariably the lone voice in a hostile sea at such meetings ,_,  he always holds his own and stands his ground in a most admirable and spirited manner even when things get rather heated up ._. 
His loyalty to and support for President Goodluck Jonathan and his administration is second to none and I have often wondered how difficult things would have been for us if Akin and his likes were the ones speaking for this government ._. 
He is an intellectual par excellence and one of the most under -_: utilized assets that the PDP has in its armoury ._. 
Yet I often marvel about how well he stomachs the attacks and intellectual ripostes that he suffers from those of us that are no longer in his political party but that have the rare privilege of still being in the inner circle of his friends ._. That is what makes Akin special ._. 
That ,_,  together with the fact that more than any other person that I know ,_,  he can tell his friends the bitter truth about themselves and point out their mistakes ._. 
You can count on him for that ._. 
And the strangest and most uncanny thing is that nine times out of ten he has been proved right ._. Today I shall take a cue from my brother Akin and tell a few bitter home truths to my own friends and political associates in the APC ._. 
Whether this will break or enhance our friendship and association remains to be seen ._. 
I hope that it does not have any negative consequences for our relationship but if it does I have absolutely no regrets ._. 
After all the greatest gift and virtue that a true friend and brother can offer is truth and wise counsel ._. 
That is what real friends are supposed to do even when that truth and counsel is unpleasant and painful to hear ._. The subject of my counsel is the suggestion by some that our party the APC should consider fielding a Muslim/Muslim ticket in the 2015 Presidential election ._. 
Even though the party leadership itself has not expressed such an intention and even though the matter still remains in the realms of speculation ,_,  as someone recently pointed out ,_,  I can confirm to you that quite a number of people within the party are discussing it privately and are actually considering it ._. 
As a matter of fact some are openly advocating and canvassing the idea ._. 
Whether we like to admit it or not this is the subject of heated discussions in many party circles today with some party leaders being for it while others are against it ._. Consequently the party would do well to issue a statement on the matter and tell us whether they are in a position to rule out such a course of action or not ._. 
If they refuse to do so the speculations will simply continue and ,_,  like an insidious cancer ,_,  the matter will eat away at the very soul of the party and eventually squander its fortunes ._. 
It is in order to avoid this and for that very reason that I deem it fit ,_,  wise and appropriate to make my views on the matter known to the world ,_,  regardless of what the consequences of doing so may be for me ._. 
The outcome of this exercise and the reaction to my counsel will determine whether I am indeed in the right political party or not ._. Let me start by stating loudly and clearly that I have nothing against Muslims ._. 
As a matter of fact ,_,  I am very proud of the fact that I have both Muslims and Christians in my family ._. 
So strong is the Muslim influence in my extended family from my mother's side that I ,_,  together with all my siblings have at least one Muslim name ._. 
Mine is Abdul Latif ,_,  which I am told in Arabic means servant of the All Gentle ,_,  and I am very proud of it ._. 
This is a name which my friend and brother Dr ._.  Hakeem Baba Ahmed ,_,  in an attempt to crack a joke about me and my one eighth Fulani bloodline ,_,  mischievously reduced to Boda Lati in one of his celebrated articles and I am still trying to find it in my heart to forgive him for that ._. I also have many friends from both the southwest and the north who are Muslims and who can testify to the fact that I have nothing against Islam ._. 
I am talking about people like my dear brother Senator Musiliu Obanikoro ,_,  our current Minister of State for Defence ,_,  who I not only grew up with in Lagos but who I also cut my political teeth with in 1990 when we both joined the defunct NRC and people like Governor Tanko Al Makura of Nasarawa state who formed and led the youth wing of the defunct NNC with me in 1989 ._. The reason that I have gone to great lengths to point out my strong links and family ties with the Islamic faith is simply to prove that I have nothing against Muslims and that the great faith of Islam is part and parcel of my proud and noble heritage ._. Yet despite my deep respect for and affinity with Islam and in spite of my fondness for all those that have espoused that ancient and noble Abrahamic and monotheic faith ,_,  I would be the first to say that it would be most improper and politically inexpedient for anyone to suggest the idea that any political party in Nigeria today should present a Muslim/Muslim ticket in next years Presidential election ._. I have said it privately in countless political meetings and I will say it publicly today ._. 
Please mark it -_:  the biggest mistake that my party ,_,  the APC ,_,  can make is to field a Muslim/Muslim ticket in the 2015 Presidential election ._. 
If we do that we will not only offend the Christian community but we will also loose the election woefully ._. 
This is not 1993 and whether we like it or not we must accept the fact that religion plays a major role in our politics today ._. 
This is not the ideal but it is the reality that we have to accept and live with ._. Our party must have both a Christian and a Muslim on the ticket if we want to be taken seriously in the Presidential election ._. 
I implore those that think otherwise to sit down and think this through properly ._. 
We must not present a Christian/Christian ticket as this would be insensitive to the feelings of Muslims and we must not present a Muslim/Muslim ticket ,_,  as this would be insensitive to the feelings of Christians ._. 
I for one would NEVER support a ticket that presents two members of the same faith no matter what the consequences would be ._. This country belongs to both Muslims and Christians -_:  we are all one and we must ensure that we do not hurt the feelings or the sensitivities of one another either advertently or inadvertently ._. 
As they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions ._. 
Let us be mindful of our actions ,_,  deeds and words ,_,  no matter how well intentioned they may be ,_,  and let us ensure that we do not confirm the terrible stereotyping that those that are against us are trying to label us with ._. Unlike some who only joined the political fray a few years ago ,_,  I have been in politics in this country for a total of 24 long years and during that period of time I have learnt a thing or two ._. 
The first lesson that I have learnt and which must be appreciated is the ability to distinguish between an ideal and reality ._. 
It is laudable to pursue an ideal and we must do all that we possibly can to enthrone it but it is disastrous to ignore the realities on the ground no matter how unsavoury or distasteful that reality may be ._. The ideal ,_,  which we all desire and which we all seek to enthrone ,_,  is to play the type of politics in our country which has no recourse to religion and where a man or woman's faith is entirely their own affair ._. 
Yet the reality is that to ignore the religious sensitivities and differences of the Nigerian electorate is a manifestation of ,_,  at the very best ,_,  political naivety of the highest order and ,_,  at the very worst ,_,  dangerous ,_,  self -_: depreciating and self -_: destructive ignorance ._. 
Simply put ,_,  religion SHOULD NOT be a factor in our politics but in reality it IS a factor ._. To those who say that the APC will produce a Presidential and Vice Presidential candidate that have integrity ,_,  capacity and competence and that the religious faith of those two candidates does not matter ,_,  I have only the following to say ._. 
The integrity ,_,  capacity ,_,  competence and all those other laudable qualities are virtues that can surely be found in adherents of both the Muslim and the Christian faith ._. They are not the exclusive preserve of the adherents of one faith alone ._. 
You can find Muslims that have these qualities and you can find Christians that have them as well ._. 
It therefore makes perfect sense to present one of such people from each of the two major faiths as a Presidential and Vice Presidential candidate respectively ._. This is especially so given the fact that Nigeria is a multi -_: religious ,_,  multi -_: cultural and multi -_: ethnic country which suffers from severe religious tensions and periodic sectarian violence and which has at least 80 million Christians and Muslims on both sides of the divide living side by side ._. 
We are already sitting on a keg of gunpowder and to ignore one side of the religious divide and treat them with contempt and disdain may be the trigger that causes that keg to explode ._. Presenting a Muslim/Muslim ticket for the 2015 Presidential election ticket ,_,  no matter how cleverly rationalised ,_,  defended or justified in the pursuit of an ideal or in the name of political correctness ,_,  will be a terrible insult to the 80 million Christians that are part and parcel of this country and it would result in their voting ,_,  en masse ,_,  for another party ._. 
My candid advice to those that are thinking that way and that are moving in that direction is that they should perish the thought and that they should do so very quickly ._. As far as I am aware the APC is not an affiliate of Al Qaeda and neither is it a Boko Haram party ,_,  a Janjaweed party or a Muslim Brotherhood Party ._. 
I have had cause to say so and to defend the intellectual integrity and what I consider to be the multi -_: religious and secular ethos and composition of the party on numerous occasions ._. 
And of course it is a pleasure ,_,  a duty and a privilege for me to do so simply because that is what I honestly believe and because I happen to be a secularist myself ._. 
Like millions of others from all over the world I believe that religion ought to have no place in the running of the affairs of any country ._. However that does not mean that we ought to ignore the very delicate religious balance that we have in Nigeria or that we should play havoc with it ._. 
To do so would be disastrous for the fortunes of the party and for the future of our nation ._. 
As a matter of fact we would be opening the gates of hell and we would be courting catastrophe ._. 
Anyone that doubts that should consider the ugly events that are unfolding in the Central African Republic today or that took place in the Sudan before the country broke into two ._. 
We must never allow such things to happen in Nigeria by any act of commission or omission ._. As far as I am aware ,_,  the APC is a party for both Muslims and Christians ._. 
It is a vehicle for change and not one that seeks to give the impression that Christians don't matter or that they are second -_: class citizens ._. 
If I am wrong then those that claim to know better or that believe that they own the party should please tell me ._. 
If it is a party where faith and religion has no place ,_,  as some would have us believe ,_,  then they should please let us know ._. 
We have an image problem ,_,  which we need to deal with ._. Permit me to share just one example of the factors that have sustained that image problem ._. 
We have a leading member of the party from Borno state that has been consistently accused of being the sole founder and originator of Boko Haram ._. In fairness to the individual concerned ,_,  the allegations about his personal involvement in these ugly events remain unproven yet all the same they remain serious and grave and they cannot be ignored for much longer ._. 
He must provide direct answers to these serious allegations so that ,_,  if they are all false ,_,  we can make it our business and duty to defend him ._. 
Until then ,_,  being in a political party that harbours and attracts the sympathy and support of such a person puts some of us in a very awkward position ._. If such things do not make some people uncomfortable they certainly make me very uncomfortable ._. 
This is especially so given the atrocities that Boko Haram has perpetuated against both Christians and Muslims in our country in the last three years ._. 
Whether we like it or not we must go out of our way to try to let the world know that we are not a party of Muslim fundamentalists and closet Islamists and if we choose not to bother to do so ,_,  it simply means that we are arrogant and that we have lost touch with reality ._. Mr ._. 
Fani -_: Kayode is a former Nigerian Minister of Aviation ._. 
He writes a weekly column for PREMIUM TIMES ._. 
The former presidential liaison officer to the senate and delegate to the ongoing National Conference ,_,  Kashim Ibrahim Imam ,_,  has said the solution to the problems of the country does not lie with the convocation of the national conference but by enthroning quality leadership ._. Imam who spoke in an interview with THISDAY yesterday said the conference had no legal backing and may not make significant impact in tackling the problems confronting the country ._. I had my reluctance about participating ,_,  specifically because ,_,  there is no enabling law that empowers the president ,_,  to convoke the conference in the first instance; I see it as a talk shop ,_,  my expectations are very low ,_,  and I don't see much coming out of it ,_,  he said ._. Imam said there were even much more fundamental issues confronting the nation ,_,  which had to do with bad governance and failure of leadership ._. 
God has given us the best of everything; our oil is the best ,_,  and it's only in Nigeria you find ebony growing in the wild ._. 
We have been richly endowed with every natural resource that you can think of ._. 
Our land is fertile ,_,  we have a population of about 180 million people ,_,  not only that ,_,  after He has given us everything good ,_,  God did not hit us with any natural disaster ._. 
Our problem ,_,  I believe and I am positive about it ,_,  is traced back to bad leadership ,_,  we do not have good leaders and that is what this country needs ,_,  he said ._. Imam bemoaned the security problem affecting most parts of the North -_: east ,_,  saying the people of the area have been cut off from every means of livelihood as a consequence of the Boko Haram insurgency ._. I think the situation Borno State is very tragic; what is happening in the North -_: east in general and then in the state in particular is dreadful ._. 
You are aware of the security challenges that we've been having for a while now which have escalated ._. 
In the past three years and we have now reached what I consider to be the boiling point ,_,  which has crippled almost every imaginable activity that one can think of ._. 
Be it commerce ,_,  agriculture ,_,  even just day to day living has been crippled; if you say the situation is pathetic ,_,  I'll say it's just gross understatementAt the last count ,_,  we have about three million people who are displaced ,_,  while more than 35 ,_, 000 people have been killed ._. 
These lives lost have been from both sides ,_,  innocent civilians ,_,  even school children ._. 
We've read about the 59 students that where literary slaughtered in Buni Yadi ,_,  it also includes the heavy losses on the side of the insurgents ._. The day they attacked Giwa barracks to free their members ,_,  more than one thousand lives were lost on their side ,_,  including the military as they tried to contain the situation ._. He said their strategy for containing the situation was very simple -_: going into the neighborhoods ,_,  and just pack literarily all the youths ,_,  and that would be the last that would be seen of them ._. 
We have today found ourselves in a situation that we lost an entire generation ,_,  the chaps that were killed were mostly very young boys ,_,  the most productive members of the society ,_,  usually between the ages of twenty to thirty ,_,  that has taken a heavy toll in terms of people that have lost their lives ,_,  apart from that ,_,  more than three thousand classrooms ,_,  in the affected states particularly in Bornu ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa have been raised down ,_,  three thousand buildings have been raised down ,_,  this include not just houses but churches and mosque ,_,  market ,_,  stalls ,_,  you name it ._. 
So the toll has been very heavy ._. What should take the centre stage is how do we fight corruption in Nigeria ,_,  how do we create enough jobs ,_,  and here we are 500 of us arguing on how to share the cake ,_,  I think the fundamental issue is everyone being selfish and not trying to solve the enormous challenges facing us ._. 
So my expectation towards the output of the conference is very low ._. 
I don't see any useful information coming out of it ,_,  he said ._. The former presidential aide called for the establishment of N300 billion -_: reconstruction fund in aid of the zone ._. 
He said ,_,  I am calling for the establishment of reconstruction fund of three hundred billion naira ._. 
The federal government budgeted two billion this year to confront the challenges in the northeast ._. 
I feel that it is grossly inadequate considering the fact that the same government ,_,  not too long ago budgeted the sum of two hundred million Nollywood actors ,_, 
Washington � A Nigerian soldier says he has witnessed incidents that suggest some Nigerian military commanders are working with Boko Haram ,_,  an Islamist militant group blamed for thousands of deaths since 2009 ._. In an exclusive interview with VOA's Hausa service ,_,  he described how his military unit ,_,  based in the northeastern Borno State region ,_,  was ambushed by Boko Haram fighters ._. The soldier ,_,  who did not want to be identified ,_,  said the commander of a nearby military unit ,_,  based in the town of Bama ,_,  recently sought assistance from his unit in carrying out a raid ._. The soldier said when the two military units joined up ,_,  they were given different uniforms ._. 
The Bama unit commander gave his own troops green uniforms ._. 
The soldier said his unit received tan desert camouflage uniforms ._. When the troops reached the battle area ,_,  the soldier said the commander of the better -_: equipped Bama unit suddenly withdrew his forces ,_,  leaving the remaining troops to fend for themselves against Boko Haram fighters ._. Speaking in Hausa ,_,  he said ,_,  We had only light arms and our men were being picked off one after the other ._. The soldier also said he recognized some of the Boko Haram fighters as his former military trainers in Kontagora ,_,  a town near the capital ,_,  Abuja ._. We realized that some of them were actually mercenaries from the Nigerian army ._.  hired to fight us ,_,  he said ._. This soldier and others have said that too often ,_,  commanders have pocketed money that was supposed to be used to help equip units ._. Government has no commentVOA has made repeated attempts to get reaction from the Nigerian government for this story but no officials have been willing to speak on the record ._. However ,_,  in a January 2012 speech ,_,  Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said Boko Haram members have infiltrated his government's executive ,_,  legislative and judicial sectors ,_,  as well as the police and armed forces ._. Jonathan has declared a state of emergency in three northern regions where Boko Haram is active ,_,  and launched operations to destroy the group's camps ._. 
Despite those efforts ,_,  though ,_,  large -_: scale attacks have continued ._. Soldier's account credibleAtlantic Council Africa Center Director Peter Pham said the soldier's account could have merit ._. It certainly would not surprise me that it is happening ,_,  said Pham ._. Pham said the goal should be to figure out how and why collaboration between military officers and terror groups could happen ._. What's critical is to understand ,_,  if there is this collusion ,_,  to understand whether it is a collusion born of corruption ,_,  born of desperation simply to avoid combat that would result in casualties for the men under your command ,_,  or if it is born of ideological sympathy with the insurgents ,_,  he said ._. Apart from some well -_: trained elite units ,_,  Pham said most of Nigeria's military is woefully underfunded and under -_: resourced in terms of equipment and training ._.

Hogendoorn is deputy director of the International Crisis Group's Africa program ._. 
The group recently released a detailed report about the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria ._. He said Nigeria's military disfunction is part of a broader problem of systemic corruption extending through most government sectors ._. Hogendoorn says drivers ,_,  such as bad governance and the inability of state institutions to provide basic services ,_,  help create a pool of unemployed youth ripe for radicalization ._. We argue that even were Boko Haram to be defeated ,_,  if you don't deal with those drivers ,_,  you are not going to be able to stabilize either northern Nigeria or the entire country ,_,  he said ._. Hogendoorn said in order for change to occur ,_,  the Nigerian government needs to address corruption and poor governance in a systematic and sustained way ._.

Last January ,_,  chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC ,_,  Prof Attahiru Jega ,_,  was at the head of a policy forum on plans towards the 2015 elections ._. A month ago ,_,  the majority of the country's governors from the north were at another forum focused on addressing the state of insecurity fanned by the Islamic Boko Haram insurgency in the region ._. An American think -_: tank raised indignation in Nigeria few years ago when it predicted that the country would disintegrate by 2015 ._. 
That was before the rage of crisis inspired by Boko Haram ._. The session ,_,  however ,_,  is directed at drawing assurances from policy makers in Nigeria and opposition leaders towards a common agenda that would ensure free and fair elections in 2015 ,_,  which will be acceptable to all stakeholders ._. 
Yaounde � There is frustration in northern Cameroon after two Italian priests and a nun of Canadian nationality were kidnapped and whisked off to Nigeria by suspected Boko Haram members ._. 
The government has deployed heavily armed troops to the area to investigate ._. Christians in northern Cameroon held a special Mass after three of their fellow believers were attacked 60 kilometers from the Nigerian area that serves as a base for the Islamist group Boko Haram ._. The bishop of the Cameroon diocese ,_,  Philip Stephens ,_,  said he did not understand why God's servants should be given such treatment ._. I do not understand how two priests and a sister who work for God ,_,  who work for the people ,_,  and who like the people can be kidnapped ._. 
There is no reason ,_,  no reason and I am very sad ,_,  very sad ,_,  said the bishop ._. Seminarian Ladde Pierre witnessed the kidnapping and alerted police ._. 
He said a group of armed men arrived shortly before midnight last Friday ,_,  and ransacked church buildings before seizing the priests and nun ._. He said he noticed the priests had been brutalized and their rooms ransacked ._. Pierre added that the armed men did not leave only with the clergy ._. The kidnappers ,_,  he said ,_,  wanted to take the vehicle of the Reverend Sister and when it was difficult to start it ,_,  they left with a smaller vehicle ._. The priests ,_,  who are about 50 years old ,_,  were identified as Giampaolo Marta and Gianantonio Allegre ,_,  and the nun as Gilberte Bussier ._. Father Marta had been in Cameroon for more than six years while Father Allegre had arrived around a year ago ._. 
Seventy -_: year -_: old Sister Gilberte has been in Cameroon for nearly four decades and was soon to be evacuated to her native Canada for prolonged ill health ._. The priests had been working on improving water supplies and fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS ._. Cameroon Minister of Defense Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo went to northern Cameroon and ordered investigators to determine who was responsible for the attack ._. 
The local population already blames Boko Haram which has carried out several kidnappings in the region during the past year ._. Cameroon military spokesman Colonel Didier Badjeck told VOA the attack could have been avoided if the population cooperated with the military ._. Administrative and traditional leaders must prepare the people to inform the military in case there is any threat ,_,  he said ,_,  adding that when someone hears a gun shot ,_,  it means he or she is not dead and must take precautionary measures and inform authorities ._. The abduction of the clergy members brings to 11 the number of people kidnapped in northern Cameroon since Boko Haram started its activities in Nigeria ._. The attacks came after Nigeria asked its neighbors of the Lake Chad Basin Commission to create a task force to handle terrorists ,_,  but Cameroon said it would only contribute troops when there is need ._. Last month ,_,  Cameroon's government denied press allegations its territory is being used as a training ground for rebel activities ,_,  and later announced its troops had seized a heavy consignment of arms and ammunition for Boko Haram members in north Cameroon ._. 
Ethnic and religious bigotry have stood in the way of our unity ,_,  development and peace despite the effects of the evils of prejudice in other countries ,_,  which should open our eyes ._. 
It appears our politicians ,_,  religious leaders and other opinion leaders have not learnt any lessons ._. 
God has a purpose for creating mankind into diversity and he couldn't have meant our differences to be an excuse to hate and kill one another ._. Demagoguery by politicians and religious leaders across the country has not and cannot help anybody ._. 
No country that once a fought a mutually destructive civil war like Nigeria should take peace and unity for granted ._. 
Leaders at all levels have a sense of responsibility to promote peace and love among Nigeria ._. Nobody should seek cheap popularity by promoting the message of hate among fellow Nigerians ._. 
In the words of the late U ._. S ._. 
President Richard Nixon ,_,  where peace is fragile ,_,  make it strong ,_,  where peace is temporary ,_,  make it permanent and where peace is unknown ,_,  make it welcome ._.  one cannot agree more ._. 
With this background ,_,  I wish to command the organizers of the recent Christian/Muslim Inter -_: faith Dialogue ,_,  held in Abuja with the theme :_:  Thinking Nigeria ._. 
Putting Nigeria's larger interest before our narrow interests is crucial to any efforts towards achieving lasting peace and unity ._. 
In the words of the late British Prime Minister ,_,  Sir ._. 
Winston Churchill ,_,  war is the failure of reason ._. 
Once a people fail to think and reason ,_,  they tend to move in the wrong direction ._. Nobody can put a figure on the number of innocent Nigerians killed as a result of ethnic and religious bigotries across the country ,_,  with northern Nigeria taking a notorious lead with the Boko Haram menace ,_,  the crises in Plateau and Benue States ._. 
Extremism in any form is not good for the well -_: being and progress of any society ._. 
Your own ethnicity and religion does not give you a licence to exterminate others because they are different ._. 
In the 21st century ,_,  when countries are making advances in science and technology to improve human progress ,_,  we should not devote our energies to destroying one another in the name of ethnic and religious differences ._. 
In fact ,_,  even our nascent democratic order is being threatened by the explosion of bigotry ._. Intolerance and prejudice produce seeds of hatred against others ._. 
You cannot express the love of God by the number of innocent lives you have destroyed ._. 
Every religion places a high premium on the sanctity of life ._. 
There is no excuse ,_,  whatsoever ,_,  therefore for anybody to kill innocent people without justification ._. 
In Islam ,_,  chapter 5 ,_,  verse 32 ,_,  of the Holy Quran States unambiguously that killing one innocent soul equals harming the entire humanity ._. 
Christianity does not accept the killing of the innocents either ._. 
Then why has life become so valueless Why has humanity deserted people so badly that you wonder whether the teachings of their religions mean anything to them Are Muslims and Christian zealots truly obeying the teachings of God Religion preaches love and followers of Islam and Christianity can only demonstrate the strength of their faith in practice ,_,  by showing compassion ._. 
When cruelty replaces compassion ,_,  then you wonder what becomes of the teachings of our religions about the sanctity of life ._. It is the height of irresponsibility to seek cheap popularity by encouraging and propagating the messages of animosity against others just because they are different ._. 
Leadership should not be in the hands of extremists; hate mongers won't care about how many people lose their lives to attain their goals of achieving popularity ._. 
Inter -_: faith dialogue is essential to any efforts towards reducing tension and eliminating intolerance ,_,  bigotry and prejudice ._. 
The behavior of the followers is directly proportional to the kind of messages they imbibe from their leaders ._. 
War and destruction cannot and should never be alternative to lasting peace ._. 
No progress and development can take place in a state of conflicts ,_,  which compound the social crisis of poverty ._. Constructive engagement between Muslims and Christians is necessary to bridge the communication gap between them ._. 
Inter -_: faith dialogue is an indispensable platform to nip crises in the bud ._. 
Unless we return to the true teachings of our religions ,_,  we will remain backward while other countries are making progress ._. 
Major Hamza Al -_: Mustapha ,_,  the Chief Security Officer to the late General Sani Abacha ,_,  who attended the Inter -_: faith dialogue in Abuja ,_,  deserves praise for always indentifying himself with the efforts to promote unity ,_,  peace and understanding among Nigerians ._. 
This young army Major has always reminded our youths and politicians that the north cannot achieve peace and progress if we continue on the path of mutual destruction ._. 
He always criticizes politicians ,_,  religious and community leaders that incite people instead of preaching peace and unity ._. 
Plateau State is the now the shadow of its former self because of perennial ethnic/religious crisis while the northeast is economically destroyed by insurgents ._. 
It is easier to hate than to understand and there cannot be understanding without communication ._. 
Therefore ,_,  inter -_: faith dialogues should be promoted and sustained at all levels ._.

The gunmen also set a number of houses and shops ablaze ._. After the attackers had left ,_,  members of the community embarked upon the unpleasant task of retrieving the bodies and burying them in mass graves ._. The Emir of Dansadau ,_,  Alhaji Husaini Adamu ,_,  told our reporter :_:  This is not the first time the people of the area would be facing such problem but today's attack was the worst of its kind in the history of killings in this area ._. The Emir ,_,  therefore ,_,  called on the authorities concerned to ,_,  as a matter of urgency ,_,  take immediate measures to address the problem ._. Assistant InspectorGeneral of Police AIG Zone 10 ,_,  Mamman Sule also in his remarks warned the vigilante groups to desist from holding such meetings which he described as illegal ._.

Our correspondent also learnt that seven motorists and passengers were shot dead by suspected terrorists along the MaiduguriBiu road a few metres away from Gwargube village ._. The MaiduguriBiu road has become a death trap in the past few weeks ,_,  as hardly a day passes without cases of road attacks by the terrorists ,_,  despite the presence of security operatives patrolling the road ._. A member of the vigilante youth ,_,  a ._. k ._. a Civilian JTF ,_,  who did not want his name to be mentioned ,_,  in a telephone call said :_:  A group of terrorists ,_,  yesterday ,_,  laid ambush to some motorists and passengers along the MaiduguriBiu road and killed many people before they invaded Gwargube village and solicited support from the villagers or risk deadly attacks ._.

Nigerian soldiers are B'Haram mercenaries  -_:  -_: SoldierMeanwhile ,_,  a Nigerian soldier has alleged that some military commanders were mercenaries of the Boko Haram sect ._. 
In a report published by the VOA Hausa Service ,_,  an unnamed Nigeria soldier narrated how corruption and shortchange of soldiers' funds by commanders pushed Nigerians soldiers to partner with Boko Haram against their nation ,_,  resulting in the deaths of thousands of Nigerians since 2009 ._. In an exclusive interview with the VOA's Hausa Service ,_,  the unnamed soldier described how his military unit ,_,  based in the Borno State was ambushed by Boko Haram fighters ._. The soldier said the commander of a nearby military unit ,_,  based in the town of Bama ,_,  recently sought assistance from his unit in carrying out a raid ._. He said when the two military units joined up ,_,  they were given different uniforms ._. 
The Bama unit commander gave his own troops green uniforms ._.

We realised that some of them were actually mercenaries from the Nigerian army ._.  hired to fight us ._. This soldier and others have said that too often ,_,  commanders have pocketed money that was supposed to be used to help equip units ._. The unnamed soldier is an impostor  -_:  -_: OlukoladeDenying the allegation of collaboration between some military commanders in the North -_: East and Boko Haram insurgents ,_,  the Director of Defence Information ,_,  Maj -_: Gen ._. 
Chris Olukolade ,_,  argued that a case of impersonation cannot be ruled out to create wrong impressions for the public ._. He ,_,  however ,_,  assured that the military was probing the purported confession of a soldier which alleged that some army commanders were working together with Boko Haram ._. According to Olukolade ,_,  Ordinarily ,_,  the Nigerian soldier is too disciplined to be involved in that kind of utterances on radio ._. 
Let no terrorist propagandists hide under the guise of not wanting to disclose their source to present impostors as representing Nigerian soldiers ._. We do not agree that he is our soldier; we believe very strongly that he is not our soldier ._. 
We are still studying the interview to confirm the motive ._. 
At the moment ,_,  we suspect that the intention is to create wrong impressions and cause disaffection ._. A case of impersonation cannot also be ruled out ._. 
We are taking the information seriously despite the fallacies contained in it ._. 
We do not believe he is one of our soldiers ._. 
A Nigerian soldier has said that he has witnessed several incidents that suggest that some Nigerian military commanders are working with the outlawed Boko Haram militant group blamed for thousands deaths since 2009 ._.

The officer and others have often accused the military commanders of diverting money that was supposed to be used to help equip units into their pockets ._.

The Nigerian military said on Friday that it would investigate Amnesty International's allegations of human right abuses by security operatives in the ongoing operations in the North -_: East ._. This military said this in a statement issued by Chris Olukolade ,_,  the Director of Defence Information ,_,  in Abuja ._. The report titled :_:  Nigeria :_:  More than 1 ,_, 500 killed in Armed Conflict in North -_: Eastern Nigeria in early 2014 ,_,  contains allegations of human right abuses in the north eastern part of Nigeria ._. Notwithstanding the fact that the report is not consistent with the actual situation on ground ,_,  security authorities will ensure that the allegations as it affects government forces are duly investigated ._. 'This will be with a view to taking necessary action to address any case of human right breach on the part of troops ,_,  Mr ._. 
Olukolade ,_,  a Major General ,_,  said ._. The report ,_,  he said ,_,  was a new dimension to the fact that the operation in the North -_: East was necessitated by need to address the human rights abuses perpetrated by terrorists ._. He said that in spite of the peculiar asymmetric nature of the security challenge ,_,  measures were being taken by troops to comply with tenets of human rights and rules of engagement ._. Mr ._. 
Olukolade said apart from inculcating the necessity for observance of human rights in troops ,_,  regular programmes have been conducted to review human rights situation related to the conduct of the operationsIt is in this respect that most of those apprehended in the counter -_: terrorist operations are kept in custody ._. These detention facilities have been visited by non -_: governmental organisations ,_,  including International Committee of the Red Cross and others to verify the conditions of detainees ._. This is even in the face of destruction of relevant amenities by the terrorists who have burnt down prisons ,_,  courts and government facilities in that part of the country in the course of their ceaseless attacks ,_,  he said ._. Mr ._. 
Olukolade said the allegation contained in the report ,_,  attributing gross abuses of human rights of Nigerians to both the terrorists and the security forces was confounding ._. Nigerians are once again assured that in carrying out the mandate of ridding the country of terrorism ,_,  necessary efforts will be made to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens ,_,  he said ._. In the report ,_,  Amnesty International ,_,  AI ,_,  had stated that at least 1500 people ,_,  more than half of who are civilians ,_,  have been killed in the first three months of 2014 alone following an upsurge of the conflict in the northeast of Nigeria ,_,  Amnesty International AI has said ._. In the report published on Monday ,_,  the global human rights organisation said many killed are victims of the terrorist group ,_,  Boko Haram and uncontrolled reprisals by the country's security forces ._. AI called for an independent investigation into what it said may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity ._. More than 1 ,_, 500 deaths in three months indicate an alarming deterioration in the situation ._. 
The international community cannot continue to look the other way in the face of extrajudicial executions ,_,  attacks on civilians and other crimes under international law being committed on a mass scale ._. 
Civilians are paying a heavy price as the cycle of violations and reprisals gather momentum ,_,  said Research and Advocacy Director for Africa at Amnesty International ,_,  Netsanet Belay ._. The organisation particularly mentioned the incident of March 14 when Boko Haram fighters attacked Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri to free their fighters imprisoned in the military facility ._. 
AI said the military unleashed a brutal crackdown on former detainees as they tried to flee after being freed by the gunmen ._. Relying on witness ,_,  lawyers ,_,  human rights campaigners ,_,  and hospital staff accounts from across the city ,_,  AI said soldiers as well as members of the vigilante group ,_,  Civilian JTF ,_,  rounded up unarmed former detainees and summarily executed them ._. 
It also said it is in possession of satellite images that show possible mass graves ._. The scale of atrocities carried out by Boko Haram is truly shocking creating a climate of fear and insecurity ._. 
But this cannot be used to justify the brutality of the response that is clearly being meted out by the Nigerian security forces ,_,  said Mr ._. 
Belay ._. The former detainees were in a classroom ._. 
They started screaming 'we are not Boko Haram ._. 
We are detainees !_. ' My neighbours and I saw the soldiers take the men to a place called 'no man's land ,_, ' behind the University of Maiduguri ._. 
We watched as the soldiers opened fire killing all 56 ._. 
They were killed in front of us ._. 
All of them ,_,  an unnamed witness told AI ._. Another witness at the Jiddari Polo area of the city told Amnesty International that the Civilian JTF rounded up more than 190 fleeing detainees and handed them over to the soldiers who proceeded to shoot them ._. I saw the soldiers asking the people to lie on the ground ._. 
There was a small argument between the soldiers and the civilian JTF ._. 
The soldiers made some calls and a few minutes later they started shooting the people on the ground ._. 
I counted 198 people killed at that checkpoint ,_,  the witness said ._. Following the unwillingness of the Nigerian authorities to investigate allegations of extra -_: judicial killings ,_,  AI called on Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS ,_,  the African Union and United Nations to investigate these accusations ._. The summary killing of these detainees amount to extrajudicial executions and are crimes under international law ._. 
These killings follow an entrenched pattern of deaths in custody of detainees held in relation to the situation in the northeast ,_,  said Mr ._. 
Belay ._. The international community ,_,  and in particular the African Commission on Human and People's Rights and the UN Human Rights Council ,_,  must ,_,  as a matter of urgency ,_,  ensure that a thorough ,_,  impartial and transparent investigation is conducted into these allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Nigeria ._. This is not the first time AI or other rights organisations will call for investigations into alleged extrajudicial and the indiscriminate killing of civilians by Boko Haram and the Nigerian military ._. 
Human Rights Watch and other rights groups had published detailed reports of the killings and destruction of property of those suspected of being members of Boko Haram by the military ._. 
This column is kiss -_: ing Dr ._.  Ngozi Okonjo -_: Iweala this week ._. 
It will in fact be the shortest piece I've ever offered on this platform ._. 
I know y'all got dirty minds ._. 
Don't worry ,_,  it simply means we are keeping it short and simple for Nigeria's de facto Prime Minister who has programmed herself never to get it ._. I was in fact working on a different piece when I stumbled on a Facebook update by Seyi Osiyemi ,_,  one of my 'personal people' on social media ._. 
I decided immediately that his short but powerful update was going to be my guest on this column today ._. 
If you are tired of Ngozi Okonjo -_: Iweala's data and statistical Boko Haram i ._. e ._.  her constant bombardment of the public sphere with rosy data and statistics almost always immediately contradicted by her bosses in Bretton Woods ,_,  you need to pay attention to Seyi Osiyemi below ._. 
As we say in Naija ,_,  nothing to add ._. 
Says Osiyemi :_: Until Iya Ramota ,_,  the tomato seller at Mile 12 Market ,_,  can be guaranteed uninterrupted power supply ._.  any economic statistic indicating that Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa will continue to sound like 'advanced Greek language' !_. Until Sefiu ,_,  the vulcanizer at Ajegunle ,_,  can turn on his water tap without relying on borehole ._.  any talk of Nigeria being the largest economy cannot be worth more than the paper it is written on !_.  !_. Two years ago ,_,  I relocated from one of the richest countries in the world to one of the world's poorest ._. 
However ,_,  my quality of life has remained the same ._. 
I do not own an inverter system ,_,  talkless of power generator ._. 
If at all there's a power outage ,_,  it's only for few minutes ._.   ._. yes ,_,  few minutes !_. And there's a call centre I can call to complain about bad service ._. 
In fact ,_,  I can contact the local power distribution company on social media ._. 
I have water running through the tap 24/7 ._.   ._. no boreholes ,_,  no water tanker !_.  ._.  and this is happening right in Uganda and not Oklahoma or Monaco !_. Dr ._.  Ngozi Okonjo -_: Iweala ,_,  shey you hearDazzol !_.

The incident happened in Galadima Sunday Saturday during a meeting of community leaders and representatives of vigilante groups ,_,  who were discussing ways to thwart armed robbers and cattle rustlers ,_,  he said ._. He said security forces had been deployed to the area ._. 
But survivors said more than 60 people might have died in the attack ._. 
We counted 61 bodies from the scene of the attack last night ,_,  while many people were wounded ,_,  a survivor who gave his name only as Babaginda ,_,  from neighbouring Kaduna State told AFP ._. He said he was lucky to escape with his life and implored the security forces to stem incessant attacks by Fulani rustlers on villages in the area ._. The conflict between Fulani herdsmen and local farmers over land rights ,_,  particularly in central Nigeria ,_,  has persisted for more than a decade despite a series of peace efforts across several states ._. In another incident ,_,  members of terrorist sect ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  laid siege on the Maiduguri -_: Biu highway in Borno State on Saturday ,_,  killing seven persons during the onslaught ._. The outlawed sect's siege on the road ,_,  forced many motorists to avoid the highway and other major highways leading to the Borno State capital ._. It was gathered that after the sect killed the unsuspecting travellers ,_,  they also stormed Gwargube ,_,  an adjoining village on the road ,_,  where they were alleged to have summoned the villagers and demanded that they cooperate or get killed ._. A youth vigilante in the area ,_,  who did not want his name in print ,_,  said the attackers were well armed ._. He said :_:  They stopped the vehicles and killed seven of the occupants ._. 
Many others were injured and taken to a hospital in Maiduguri ._. In Gwargube ,_,  they vowed to kill the villagers and burn their property if they cooperated with security operatives ._. 
They did not kill anyone there ,_,  he said ._. The Maiduguri -_: Biu Road has recorded several attacks in the last three years ,_,  during which scores have been killed ._. 
Beyond the chest -_: thumping by the country's leaders and watchers of the economy that Nigeria has finally displaced South Africa as the largest economy on the African continent and currently occupies the 26th position in the league of largest economies in the world ,_,  the recent rebasing of the country's gross domestic product would not ,_,  in practical terms ,_,  immediately change anything about the Nigerian economy ._. The rebased figures ,_,  which put the value of products and services manufactured in the country at $453 ._. 96 billion in 2012 and an estimated $509 ._. 97 billion or N80 ._. 22 trillion in 2013 ,_,  represents a quantum leap of about 75 ._. 58 per cent and 89 ._. 22 per cent ,_,  respectively ,_,  over the nominal GDP using the old base year of 1990 ._. The rebasing ,_,  which is coming after 24 years ,_,  meant replacing or changing the base year used for the compilation of constant price estimates from 1990 to a new and more recent base year ,_,  which in this case is 2010 ._. 
Essentially ,_,  the exercise merely reconciled the varying estimates over the years ,_,  thus providing the basis for the methodological and conceptual framework for data review and improvement ._. With the rebased estimates providing more accurate economic statistics ,_,  economic planners are better able to formulate appropriate economic policies and strategies to achieve desired development objectives in all key segments of the economy ._. Though statisticians and economic analysts may differ broadly in the assessment of the exercise ,_,  the upside of the re -_: benchmarking is that it has helped Nigeria capture the structural changes in the economy and thus provided data ,_,  which are near to the truth ._. It has also highlighted sectors hitherto under -_: reported and unaccounted for such as telecommunications ,_,  entertainment ,_,  creative industries ,_,  services and small and medium scale enterprises informal sector ,_,  thereby providing economic planners ,_,  domestic and foreign direct investors the necessary information on the Nigerian economy ._. The rebasing ,_,  according to analysts ,_,  will also bestow some sort of positive perception on the economy ,_,  since its data will now be considered more credible by multilateral institutions as well as research organisations ._. In effect ,_,  beyond providing a basis for methodological collection ,_,  treatment and dissemination of data ,_,  and highlighting areas of strength and weaknesses for policy makers to look at ,_,  the rebasing has nothing to do with the common man on the street ._. With rising unemployment ,_,  widespread poverty ,_,  widening income inequality ,_,  insecurity ,_,  poor governance and the infrastructure deficit ,_,  problems not peculiar to Nigeria alone ,_,  Nigerians would wake up this morning to realise that there's been no change in the quality of life ._. Generators would continue to hum away and emit carbon dioxide into the air; the potholes on the roads would not disappear; health care facilities would still be inadequate; the quality of education would be no different from what it was yesterday; kidnappers ,_,  Fulani herdsmen ,_,  armed robbers and Boko Haram terrorists would continue with their reign of terror; while the unemployed and beggars would continue to struggle to eke a living ._. Add to this the fact that South Africa ,_,  which Nigeria has overtaken as the continent's largest economy ,_,  boasts better infrastructure and exports goods and services to the rest of Africa and beyond ._. 
Nigeria on the other hand ,_,  is an import -_: dependent economy ,_,  with only one product that contributes to more than 70 per cent of total earnings ._. Besides ,_,  though the GDP in nominal terms increased exponentially ,_,  the country's GDP per capital ,_,  which measures the average earning capacity of the people in a country or state ,_,  only increased marginally ._. Indeed ,_,  at $2 ,_, 688 per capital ,_,  Nigeria still lags behind South Africa ,_,  Tunisia and Egypt on the continent ,_,  and was only marginally better off than South Sudan ,_,  Sudan ,_,  Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire ._. Concurring ,_,  economic analysts said the rebasing results have not changed anything significantly ,_,  because Nigeria remains underdeveloped with combined figures for manufacturing and industry still below 50 per cent at 32 per cent ,_,  respectively ._. For the Managing Director of Financial Derivatives Company ,_,  Birsmack Rewane ,_,  the exercise was a move from reality to vanity ,_,  adding that Nigerians would wake up today to read that the country's GDP is the largest in Africa without anything changing positively for them ._. Nigerians will still buy petrol at the same price ,_,  they will still have the same amount of money in their pockets ,_,  electricity is not going to improve on Monday morning ._. 
So the exercise is a journey from reality to vanity ,_,  he said ,_,  pointing out that GDP measures output only and not revenue ._. The Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Minister of Finance ,_,  Dr ._.  Ngozi Okonjo -_: Iweala ,_,  admitted as much while speaking at the press conference on the rebasing exercise in Abuja ._. 
She said the rebased figures do not necessarily mean that production has gone up in the economy ,_,  adding that what the exercise has done is to improve the national data ._. Also ,_,  in an interview yesterday with Arise TV ,_,  a sister company of THISDAY Newspapers ,_,  the minister warned that Nigerians should not get carried away by the numbers ,_,  as the country continues to face the same challenges before the rebased figures were announced ._. She said :_:  Nigeria still faces a lot of challenges :_:  That of unemployment for our youths ,_,  infrastructure and we need to strengthen governance ,_,  so all these must still be addressed ._. Nonetheless ,_,  the rebased figures clearly indicate that the structure of the Nigerian economy has changed significantly ,_,  leading to a decline in the share of agriculture sector and a rise in the share of services in the nominal GDP ,_,  indicating a stronger diversification in the economy than earlier reported ._. Data of the 1990 nominal series showed that agriculture contributed 30 per cent to GDP ,_,  while industry contributed 46 ._. 1 per cent ,_,  and services contributed 23 ._. 6 per cent ._. 
However ,_,  according to the rebased 2010 series ,_,  in nominal terms ,_,  the share of agriculture declined to 24 per cent ,_,  so did the share of industry 25 ._. 8 per cent ,_,  while the share of services increased to 50 ._. 2 per cent ._. Similarly ,_,  the number of economic activities accounting for 70 per cent of nominal GDP rose from three to six after the rebasing ._. 
There are plenty of questions that are still begging for answers arising from last Sunday's shocking episode in Abuja when inmates attempted to break out of the headquarters of the Department of State Security ,_,  DSS ,_,  more popularly known as SSS State Security Service  ._. There was tension and anxiety in Abuja and across the country as well when heavy gunfire was heard around Yellow House ,_,  which is a stone's throw away from the State House ,_,  official residence of President Goodluck Jonathan ._. 
Other key offices such as the National Assembly and the Supreme Court are also in the vicinity ._. Residents of the area also noticed the quick movement of soldiers when men of the Guards Brigade immediately deployed to the surroundings of Yellow House and cordoned off several streets around it ._. 
Many people who happened to be passing by were rounded up ,_,  though they were later released ._. In the wake of this major security scare ,_,  the SSS' deputy director for Public Affairs Ms Marylyn Ogar issued three statements in the course of Sunday morning and afternoon which sought to explain what happened ._. 
She said ,_,  At 0715 hours ,_,  the service suspect handler went to the detention facility within the Headquarters to feed the suspects ._. 
One of the suspects attempted to disarm him by hitting him at the back of his head with his handcuff ._. 
His attempt to escape drew the attention of other guards at the facility who fired some shots to warn and deter others ._. 
The gun shots attracted the attention of the military with which we have an understanding of mutual assistance in the event of any threat ._. 
The Army immediately deployed a team to reinforce our perimeter guards to forestall any external collaborators ._. In subsequent statements ,_,  Ms Ogar said 21 persons were confirmed to have died in the incident ,_,  apparently all of them detainees because she said two DSS personnel were wounded in the encounter and were receiving treatment in a hospital ._. 
She later told a radio station that All of the 21 were killed by ._.  operatives of the DSS ._. 
She said an investigation has been launched ._. 
We will determine who shot who and at what point and how many were shot by whom and for what reason ,_,  she said ._. 
Ogar also said the gun seized by the inmate had more than 90 rounds of live ammunition and that he had fired it sporadically ._. 
She said the gunfire heard for hours in and around the SSS headquarters were simply warning shots in case the detainees had outside help ._. Further efforts by the media to extract more information from Ms Ogar were rebuffed; the DSS spokesperson has over the years established a firm reputation of engaging the media only in a one -_: way communication ._. 
She states what she wants and refuses to answer any enquiries ._. 
The secrecy with which DSS envelops its operations and its refusal to offer explanations to Nigerians contrasts these days with Defence Headquarters' robust information flow concerning its on -_: going operations against Boko Haram ._. 
DHQ also responds to questions more readily than DSS does even though it is fighting a war ,_,  the highest level of security engagement ._. The little information put out by DSS on last week's shock event inevitably leaves many questions unanswered and for which Nigerians are demanding for answers ._. 
Many observers have questioned ,_,  for instance ,_,  why so much gunfire was used because a handcuffed detainee hit a man who went to feed him ._. 
If he did seize a loaded gun as DSS said ,_,  the question to ask is what kind of sloppy agent was it that entered a dangerous prisoner's cell with his firearms and turned his back on the suspect Is that the way DSS handles high -_: value terror suspects If so ,_,  then we are probably in for many more episodes such as last Sunday's ._. If one handcuffed detainee seized a gun ,_,  how did he manage to handle it with such devastating effect And what did the other detainees do to necessitate a massacre such as the killing of 21 of them when ,_,  according to official account ,_,  they did not kill any agent Another very important question is ,_,  who were these detainees that were killed DSS dropped broad hints that they were Boko Haram terror suspects but that is not enough ._. 
What are their names We are aware that the military holds hundreds if not thousands of Boko Haram suspects in various military facilities in the North East and Abuja ._. 
It could be assumed that the relatively few suspects held at DSS headquarters are the most valuable ones ._. 
Nigerians should know their names and what offences they were being held for; the death of 21 persons cannot be waived away in terror -_: suspect anonymity ._. Even though DSS has launched an investigation ,_,  it is clear enough that it cannot be trusted to handle an impartial investigation and to come out with the truth behind the sordid event ._. 
The Federal Government ,_,  the National Assembly and the National Human Rights Commission must step in with their own probe to unravel what happened ._. 
Memories are still fresh of the Apo episode when DSS operatives supported by soldiers carried out a shoot -_: first -_: and -_: ask -_: questions -_: later operation that resulted in the death of many innocent wheel barrow pushers in the guise of raiding a Boko Haram hideout ._. 
Up until now we have not heard the truth of what happened ._. Suspicions are also rife that the whole episode could have been stage -_: managed in order to wipe out some high -_: value terror suspects ,_,  maybe to avoid having their colleagues mount a rescue mission some day ._. 
Already ,_,  Amnesty International is accusing the Nigerian military of capitalizing on last month's attack on the Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri to wipe out some 600 detainees ._. 
Unless DSS comes clean with the answers to all these questions ,_,  it may not be long before it is also accused of treading a similar path and wiping out detainees ,_,  rather than fully investigating them and charging them to court for any offences they may have committed against this country ._.

Jonathan's Committee Opens Secret TalksWith Sect LeadersA week after 21 suspected members of Boko Haram sect were killed during a foiled jailbreak attempt at the headquarters of the Department of State Security DSS in Abuja ,_,  nobody has come forward to claim their remains ,_,  Sunday Trust investigation has revealed ._. The inmates had attempted to escape from detention last Sunday when ,_,  according to the DSS ,_,  one of them attacked a guard and seized his weapon ,_,  resulting in hours of shootout that left 21 detainees dead and two security agents injured ._. The situation was brought under control when soldiers from the Guards Brigade intervened and cordoned off the area ._. Bodies of the suspected Boko Haram members were later deposited at the mortuary of the National Hospital in Abuja by the personnel of the security service ._. The DSS did not ,_,  however ,_,  disclose the identities of the inmates ,_,  provide details as to the time and places of their arrest or their respective positions in the hierarchy of the terrorist group ._. When our reporters visited the hospital on Friday ,_,  officials disclosed that the remains were being kept in the morgue under the instruction of the security operatives ._. One of the officials who did not give his names also said that no relations or acquaintance of any of the killed suspects had come forward to either identify the remains or claim them for burial ._. Nobody has requested to see the corpses or asked to be allowed to collect any of them since the security agents dropped them here ,_,  the staff who works at the hospital's mortuary said ._. Another official said the identities of the bodies were not disclosed to the hospital ,_,  adding there is no record in the hospital to show who they are or what their names are ._. He said alphabets were attached to each of the bodies ,_,  as they were brought to the hospital ,_,  adding that only the DSS knew what the letters stood for ._. When contacted ,_,  the hospital's spokesperson ,_,  Dr Tayo Haastrup ,_,  said the hospital had no information on any of the dead suspects ._. 
All we know about them is not different from what Marilyn Oga has told the media ,_,  he said ,_,  referring to DSS spokeswoman ._. Meanwhile ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan's 7 -_: man secret committee ,_,  which is charged with the task of renewing talks with Boko Haram sect has opened dialogue with leaders of the group ,_,  Sunday Trust can reveal ._. The 7 -_: man committee ,_,  which is headed by the Minister of Special Duties ,_,  Barrister Kabiru Turaki ,_,  is made up of five members of the previous Presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North ,_,  one member of a Civil Society Organisation and a top army personnel ._. While setting up the committee ,_,  named President's Committee on Continuous Dialogue and Resolution Challenges in North ,_,  Jonathan gave them a five -_: point agenda ,_,  including :_:  -_:  To continue from where the previous committee stopped in its task and particularly engage any group that may be ready for dialogue; -_:  To develop ,_,  together with relevant agencies of government ,_,  a frame -_: work for the granting of amnesty; -_:  To develop and implement ,_,  together with relevant agencies of government ,_,  the frame -_: work for disarmament; and -_:  To develop ,_,  with the relevant agencies of government ,_,  a comprehensive victims support programme and strategies for its implementation to further the development of strategies and mechanisms to address the underlining causes of insurgencies to prevent reoccurrence ._. Sunday Trust learnt last night that already the committee has established links with leaders of the Boko Haram sect in several states ,_,  and some of them have expressed willingness to work with the committee ._. The committee is re -_: establishing links with leaders of Boko Haram in Bauchi ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  Katsina ,_,  Kano ,_,  Sokoto ,_,  who ,_,  during the previous dialogue had expressed the willingness to assist in resolving the conflict ._. 
Those that the committee are in talks with are not in detention; they are living in various parts of the North ._. 
Previously they had told the committee that it was possible to work out disarmament with members of the sect in various cells ._. 
They are quite willing ,_,  and in the last two weeks ,_,  the new committee members have linked up with them ,_,  a source told Sunday Trust ._. Our reporter learnt further that under the new atmosphere ,_,  government was prepared to provide funds for the repair of churches ,_,  mosques and homes which were destroyed during the insurgency ,_,  so as to bring relief to many other victims who are still alive ._. In a previous interview with Sunday Trust ,_,  Barrister Turaki claimed that the presidential committee made a tremendous breakthrough ,_,  for which government should build upon ._. He had said ,_,  Our greatest achievements are one ,_,  we were able to establish links with the insurgents ,_,  both the Jama'at Ahl -_: as Sunnah lid -_: da'wah wal -_: Jihad Boko Haram and the Ansaru sects ._. 
We've been able to change their thinking and position about dialogue ._. 
We've been able to make them realise that despite whatever differences they may have with government ,_,  arising from whatever situation or circumstance ,_,  that dialogue is inevitable ,_,  especially regarding their position as Muslims ._. Two ,_,  we've been able to supply them strong verses from the Holy Quran ,_,  not only the views expressed by and contained in the Hadith and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW ,_,  but also the views of great Islamic scholars ._. 
And three ,_,  that we were able to get them to agree to talk to us at all is a great achievement ._. 
Establishing links with them is one thing ,_,  but to be able to get them to come out and talk with us is ,_,  perhaps ,_,  the committee's greatest achievement ._. Beyond that ,_,  we've been able to build confidence ._. 
When we started ,_,  members of the sects were skeptical ,_,  suspicious actually ,_,  of the intentions of government and those of the committee ._. 
For us to make them overcome those suspicions and win their confidence was no mean feat ._. 
Despite the fact that they had tremendous respect for individual members of the committee ,_,  they were still suspicious of them coming together as a committee constituted by government ._. 
So for us ,_,  to be able to win their confidence was a rare achievement ._. The committee had while submitting its report to President Jonathan on November 5 ,_,  2013 recommended ,_,  among others ,_,  the setting up of an advisory committee on continuous dialogue ._. It also recommended the setting up of Victims Support Fund for casualties of insurgency to be administered by a new agency established specifically to assist the victims ._.

Bisa Williams is United States Deputy Assistant Secretary ,_,  Bureau of African Affairs ._. 
She is responsible for West African and African economic policy issues ._. Wiliams ,_,  who visited Nigeria ,_,  disclosed the US government's position concerning Nigeria's 2015 elections and the need for the authorities to ensure fair and non -_: violent polls ._. She stressed ,_,  in an interview with Sunday Vanguard ,_,  the importance of diversifying the Nigerian economy ._. Excerpts :_: US position on Nigerian electionsNigeria is a very fascinating and dynamic country and there are enormous interests and attractions from the international community ,_,  particularly the US ,_,  concerning your up coming elections ._. Our government has said several times that we are looking forward to the elections being credible ,_,  fair ,_,  transparent and non -_: violent ._. And that is the key ,_,  because Nigeria is such a model for the young democracies in the continent ,_,  so it is important to us that the elections are conducted credibly ._. United States government and those in the private sector have very great interests in Nigeria ,_,  and ,_,  during my visit here ,_,  I have met with your government ,_,  civil society leaders and business people to discuss better ways to progressive elections in your country and also ways that Nigeria can attract new investments ,_,  and curb oil theft ._. Curbing oil theft in the Niger -_: Delta ._. As a matter of fact ,_,  I was part of the delegation that came to Nigeria last December at President Jonathan's request to assess what is happening in the Niger -_: Delta concerning oil theft ._. We met with the oil companies ,_,  and the Nigerian authorities who are responsible for securing the water ways ._. We also held a meeting in Abuja with the governments of the region and we returned to Washington DC with reports to your government on what they could do to stop oil theft that is going on in the Niger -_: Delta region ._. Interestingly ,_,  most of our assessment actually coincided with what your own analysts came up with ,_,  so the problem and ways to approach the issue is well known ._. Your government should really insist on application rule ,_,  accountability ,_,  rule of law and transparency in receipts and documentation ._. These are honest steps to addressing the issue and your government should take that decision ._. Concerning our elections ,_,  what level of support are we expecting from the US governmentThe level of support the US government would give to Nigeria to ensure they operate fair and transparent elections would come in many ways ._. Although ,_,  Nigeria is one of the wealthiest countries in the African continent and they are quite capable of handling their elections ,_,  I am sure that the US will not relent in supporting INEC to conducting transparent elections ._. We will definitely have observers ._. 
We have been meeting with all segments of your society to talk about how important we consider these elections to be for Nigerians ,_,  and how important it is for all Nigerians of voting age to be able to execute their rights ,_,  and how important it is for the elections to be peaceful ._. Your government has not necessarily indicated a need for support ,_,  but when we had discussions with your government ,_,  your civil society and politicians ,_,  a lot of what was said focused on your government to ensure that INEC has all the resources it needs to conduct the elections the way they should be ._. The US is ready and willing to support everything that INEC needs to make sure there are no technical confusions during the elections ._. How is Nigeria's bi -_: national trade with the USWe are involved in bi -_: national trade in several ways ._. 
First ,_,  Nigeria is the second largest African trade partner that the US has ,_,  and Nigeria is probably the largest beneficiary and participant under the Opportunity Act that we have ._. 
But it is true that majority of Nigerian goods that are exported to United States are oil related ._. And when you take out the oil proceeds ,_,  Nigeria still has some respectable degree of exports nearly as many as we have hoped for to further encourage bi -_: national trade ._. So I think there are a couple of things to think about with Africa or Nigeria specifically when you talk about bi -_: national trade ._. One is that Nigeria needs to diversify its economy ,_,  and not put all the money in one basket ,_,  which is the oil basket ._. Nigeria needs to diversify its interests and attention and invest its money in producing other things that can be exported ,_,  aside oil ._. Nigeria certainly has the resources ,_,  the strength and creativity ,_,  in addition to the human resources ,_,  to produce other export goods ._. So the burden is not on us ,_,  but on you to look within you for other things which you can choose from that could further grow your economy ._. It is also important for you to use that same creativity which you have to look around for other greater markets prospects and try as much to improve your infrastructures to get your goods move from Nigeria to Togo ,_,  Chad ,_,  or to Tunisia ,_,  because you are bound to probably reap far better proceeds than you would in trying to get that number of products to the American market ._. This is one of the reasons President Barack Obama is focusing on another of his economic trade prospects for Africa ,_,  which is the 'Trade Africa Initiative' ._. The Trade Africa Initiative is intended to improve intra -_: African trade and shortening the time it takes to get merchandise across land borders ._. Human power and productive capacity ._. Estimates are that by the year 2040 ,_,  the population of Nigeria would be larger than the population of China and India and that means Nigeria would be the largest most populated country in the world ._. 
That also means that Nigeria would have the human power and productive capacity that can certainly increase your GDP ,_,  given the fact that your human capacity is educated and you use that capacity to diversify your economy ._. Another side that is depressing and at the same time promising for Africa is that 60 per cent of the sub -_: Sahara Africa is unexploited and agriculture is something that Nigeria specifically could exploit but you are not ,_,  because you feel you have got your goldmine here in oil ._. Several of Nigerian governors were at a meeting in Washington DC ,_,  and they talked about farming ,_,  agriculture ,_,  oil and transformation of food processing ,_,  but not one of them talked about the service sector and the various source employment and the money making initiatives that you have access to ._. But ,_,  essentially right now ,_,  we are working with your government and the private sector to double access to energy ,_,  access to electricity ._. Certainly ,_,  with the resources ,_,  armed with the human capacities with which to catch up with developing infrastructures ,_,  American investors and funding institutions are all ready and waiting on decision by the Nigerian government to ensure that the regular frame work is put in place ,_,  followed by consistent efforts to ensuring that planning on your national side is carried out ._. You have the structures and what you need are the people who are committed to ensuring things work the way they are supposed to ,_,  and that takes political will ,_,  rule of law ,_,  meaning enforcing the law ._. It also takes respect for human rights ,_,  accountability and wilingness to make all the people accountable ,_,  regardless of their position ,_,  political party or affiliation to a particular person ._. There has to be a robust determination and political will to do the right things ._. On Boko HaramI think it is important for your country and perhaps other affected countries to get together and map out better strategy to curtail and or sanction the perpetrators and what is happening around Boko Haram ._. Many of them take refuge in neighboring countries and it is worse in the northern part of Nigeria; in our view ,_,  there has to be a way for the countries that are affected to come together and solve the problem non -_: violentlyAnd I hope there would be discussions on how to cooperate with each other and also look at border security ._. CorruptionIt is our sincere hope that President Jonathan would join other African Presidents who have been invited to the leaders summit that President Obama would be hosting in Washington DC ._. If you ask me ,_,  I would say that corruption is extremely high in this country; there is no other polite way to say this ._. It is extremely unfortunate ,_,  because Nigeria as a country has tremendous intelligent people who do not have to be corrupt ,_,  because they have all it takes to be successful ._. 
Nigerians are resourceful and they are living in abundance of wealth and to acknowledge the fact that there is corruption in Nigeria is disheartening ._. Corruption is something that Nigerians ought to want to handle in order to restore the image of the country ._. 
They ought to be proud of their country and it is not acceptable for the citizens to say ,_,  'that is how life is in Nigeria' ._. We just had a successful bi -_: national meeting weeks ago and we sent the number four person from State Department and they talked about the burden of the society and good governance ._. We are good friends with Nigeria and as we consider these bothering issues ,_,  we would ensure that you get the high level of policy attention coming in from our government ._. 
Gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram members yesterday morning killed no fewer than 10 people and burnt over 100 houses in Buni Yadi village in Gujba local government area of Yobe State ._. LEADERSHIP SUNDAY gathered that one of the houses burnt during the attack by the sect belonged to the special adviser to the Yobe State governor on politics and legislative affairs ,_,  Alhaji Mai Mala Buni Yadi ._. Boko Haram had in February attacked and killed dozens of students of Federal Government College in the same Buni Yadi ,_,  which is about 65 kilometres to Damaturu ,_,  the state capital ._. 
Gujba town witnessed another deadly attack in the College of Agriculture last year where over 40 students were killed ._. Sources said the gunmen numbering over 50 invaded the town in the early hours of Saturday and had a field day without being confronted by security agents ._. In the last three months ,_,  insurgents have attacked Buni Yadi town more about five times but have been repelled by men of the Nigerian Army sometimes ._. This time ,_,  witnesses said ,_,  members of the Boko Haram sect devised a new strategy of dividing themselves into groups and attacking several locations simultaneously ._. Sources said one group attacked the army location in the town and succeeded in creating a diversion while another group attacked the main town ._. Despite the emergency rule declared in the three states of Yobe ,_,  Adamawa and Borno ,_,  insurgents have continued to carry out attacks against innocent citizens of the north -_: east region ._. President Jonathan ,_,  on May 11 ,_,  2013 ,_,  declared emergency rule in the three states ._. 
The emergency rule was extended by the president in November 2013 by another six months ._. However ,_,  the Northern Elders Forum last Tuesday expressed support for calls by Borno and Yobe states' elders on the federal government to not extend the emergency rule in the two states after April 19 when it is due to expire ._. 
THEY are supposed to be herdsmen taking care of their cattle ._. 
But they have metamorphosed into butchers of human beings wherever they make their abode ._. 
That is the story of Fulani herdsmen who have turned the farmlands in several states in the North into slaughter fields ._. Their hosts ,_,  who ordinarily should be their friends for accommodating them are slaughtered with reckless abandon ._. 
Hardly does a day pass without stories of the murderous activities of these nomads dotting the headlines of major newspapers in the country ._. 
They kill at the least provocation that one wonders whether they attach any value to human life at all ._. Their activities coupled with that of Boko Haram ,_,  the Islamic insurgent group ,_,  have led to uncountable number of deaths of innocent Nigerians ._. 
Over the past few years clashes between these herdsmen and farmers with their horrendous harvests of death have been reported in statesuch as Benue ,_,  Plateau ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  Niger ,_,  Jigawa ,_,  Sokoto ,_,  Edo ,_,  Delta ,_,  Yobe and Anambra ._. As at today ,_,  nearly 300 lives have been lost as a result of this killing spree ,_,  which has made life in the affected areas ,_,  short ,_,  nasty and brutish ._. 
The latest in this ugly chapter of senseless killings was recorded ,_,  yesterday ,_,  with another report that gunmen believed to be Fulani herdsmen stormed a meeting in Northern Nigeria's Zamfara State and killed 30 people ._. According to Zamfara State police spokesman Lawal Abdullahi :_:  Thirty people were killed and several others injured ._. 
The incident happened in Galadima ,_,  yesterday ,_,  during a meeting of community leaders and representatives of vigilante groups who were discussing ways to thwart armed robbers and cattle rustlers ._. 
But survivors said more than 60 people might have died in the attack ._. Preceding this latest attack were others since 2012 ._. 
In 2012 a serving senator ,_,  Dr ._.  Gyang Dantong ,_,  and the lawmaker representing Barkin Ladi in the state house of assembly ,_,  Gyang Fulani ,_,  were killed by suspected Fulani herdsmen at a mass burial in Maseh ,_,  Plateau State ._. On March 10 ,_,  2014 ,_,  Benue State governor ,_,  Gabriel Suswam ,_,  narrowly escaped death ._. 
His co -_: envoy was said to have been ambushed by Fulani men ._. 
They engaged Suswam and his security aides in exchange of gunfire at Tee -_: Akanyi village in Guma Local Government Area ._. More than 150 people were reportedly killed recently by Fulani herdsmen in an attack on three villages of Ungwar Sankwai ,_,  Ungwan Gata and Chenshyi ,_,  in Kaduna State ._. 
On March 6 ,_,  no fewer than 25 persons were feared dead in Kwande ,_,  Katsina -_: Ala and Logo local government areas of Benue State after suspected Fulani herdsmen sacked six villages in the three councils ._. Similarly ,_,  suspected Fulani herdsmen killed 55 in Benue State ._. 
The herdsmen launched the clandestine attack at Gbajimba ,_,  the headquarters of Guma Local Government Area of Benue State on March 23 ._. 
About 19 people were also killed and 15 others abducted in different villages of Agatu local government area in Benue state by Fulani herdsmen on March 30 ,_,  2014 ._. Fulani gunmenFulani Herdsmen attacked a church killing three ._. 
One woman was left widowed for a second time by Fulani Herdsmen on December 31 ,_,  2013 in Jos ._. 
In a similar attack six members of extended families were killed in their home in Foron by eight Fulani gunmen same month ._. No fewer than 40 people were left dead by Fulani herdsmen on Novemeber 25 ,_,  2013 in Barkin Ladi Jos ._. 
Fulani gunmen also killed 25 Christians in seven villages in Benue State on November 9 ,_,  2013 ._. Muslim Fulani herdsmen attacked Christian communities in the Guma Local Government Area ,_,  killing 22 Christian peasant farmers and destroying property worth millions of naira on November 20 ,_,  2013 ._. Fulani herdsmen also launched a coordinated attack on several villages in the state and killed over 21 persons ._. 
They invaded villages and killed mostly women and children ,_,  as the men were out in the fields ,_,  and burned down many buildings in the process on 0ctober 12 ,_,  2013 in Benue state ._. The orgy of killings did not stop there as about 175 people were killed by Fulani attackers in three Christian villages in Benue State on October 8 ,_,  2013 ._. 
Nigerian security forces have upped the ante in their ongoing offensive against insurgents with the deployment of advanced surveillance devices to help track the movement of key leaders and members of the Boko Haram sect that have been waging a campaign of terror in the North -_: east ._. Also yesterday ,_,  gunmen suspected to be members of Boko Haram opened fire on a mosque in Buni Gari ,_,  Yobe State killing at least 20 worshippers and inflicting serious injuries on 22 others ,_,  who were taken to a hospital in the town for treatment ._. A survivor ,_,  Musa Ibrahim ,_,  who is a civil servant ,_,  said the gunmen struck before dawn as residents of Buni Gari ,_,  which is about 100 kilometres 60 miles south of Damaturu ,_,  the Yobe State capital ,_,  were gathering for the first prayer of the day ._. The gunmen ,_,  who shot sporadically at Bunu Gari residents were also said to have burnt many houses and shops during the attack ,_,  which lasted for about an hour without help from the security forces ._. 
It was however impossible to get confirmation from relevant security authorities yesterday evening as most telephone calls in Damaturu were not going through ._. The deployment of the advanced surveillance equipment ,_,  which military sources said was with the cooperation and assistance of United States and United Kingdom ,_,  was said to be a prelude to the deployment of drones to further confront the security challenges in the North -_: east ,_,  an area which has witnessed repeated attacks that have claimed hundreds of lives ._. President Goodluck Jonathan recently commissioned Nigeria's first indigenous unmanned aerial vehicle drone at a ceremony at the Nigerian Air Force Base in Kaduna ._. 
The drone christened GULMA was built by the Nigerian military in collaboration with local institutions ._. 
It was however gathered that apart from the local drone ,_,  foreign -_: made unmanned aerial vehicles had been acquired to aid the ongoing campaign against insurgents ._. Sources noted that the new surveillance devices would help to track down insurgents in the North -_: east and North -_: central ,_,  where marauding herdsmen have been carrying out deadly attacks ._. According to security sources ,_,  the newly deployed surveillance equipment called advanced satellite imagery ,_,  would help monitor the movement of the terrorists and how to take them out ._. Meanwhile ,_,  it was gathered that all may not be well in the camp of the insurgents as local elements are currently at the mercy of their foreign mercenaries which they engaged but have now hijacked the command and control structure of the militant sect ._. Similar to what happened to the Taureg rebels in Northern Mali whose short -_: lived victory over government forces was seized by the terrorists under the control of Al -_: Qeada in the Maghreb AQIMS ,_,  Boko Haram operations are said to be effectively under the control of foreign mercenaries ._. US has however said that the $7 million reward offered for information that would lead to the identification or location of leader of Boko Haram ,_,  Abubakar Shekau ,_,  is subsisting ._. The Information Officer of the US Embassy in Abuja ,_,  Ms ._. 
Rhonda Ferguson -_: Augustus told THISDAY in an email that the offer of $7 million by the US Rewards for Justice RFJ remained valid ._. The email reads in part :_:  Although we cannot confirm Shekau's status at this time ,_,  the RFJ reward offer remains valid ._. 
Anyone who provides information leading to his identification or location may be eligible for a reward of up to $7 million ._. In another development ,_,  Defence Headquarters DHQ has refuted the allegations that security forces deliberately targeted civilians and harmless Fulani herdsmen in the ongoing campaign to flush out marauding mercenaries that have been terrorising settlements in the Northcentral zone of the country ._. The Government of Nasarawa State and Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association MACBAN had accused soldiers of targeting and killing civilians in the wake of troops deployment to the troubled spots of Benue ,_,  Nasarawa and Plateau States ._. Meanwhile ,_,  Special Adviser on Public Affairs to President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  Dr Doyin Okupe ,_,  will tomorrow at Washington DC's National Press Club hold a news conference on how the Nigerian government and the US intend to address the renewed attacks by terrorists in the country which have led to loss of hundreds of lives ._. Okupe will also provide details on a heated meeting on Boko Haram convened at the White House by President Barack Obama's National Security Adviser ,_,  Susan Rice ,_,  with 12 Nigerian governors whose regions have been hardest hit by the resurgent Boko Haram campaign ._. He will also provide insights into the government's pledge to order a forensic audit on the alleged missing oil receipts ,_,  which the suspended Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi put at about $20 billion ,_,  as well as an earlier corruption case involving the freezing of $458 million of state assets allegedly embezzled by former dictator General Sani Abacha between 1993 and 1998 ._. 
JUSTICE SUNDAY A ._. 
AKINTAN ,_,  a retired Justice of the Supreme Court ,_,  is a former member of the Police Service Commission and one -_: time Legal Adviser in the Federal Ministry of Justice ._. 
Akintan ,_,  in this piece ,_,  offers his perspectives on the ongoing efforts to review the Constitution ._. FormatThe debate as to what form the Constitution review should take has been very intensive ._. 
Some believe that it should be sovereign while some say it should not ._. 
Some even believe that such exercise was not necessary or that the matter should be left with the National Assembly as provided for in the present Constitution ._. 
While the position of those calling for a sovereign conference is not yet clearly defined ,_,  they probably envisage that the outcome of such conference should not be subjected to interference by anybody as was the position in the past ._. One thing is however clear ._. What is in issue in the present situation goes to the very root or complete existence of the present Constitution ._. 
This is because the envisaged review may result in changing the entire system or make a complete deviation from the present way we are governed ._. 
It will therefore be unreasonable to expect that the result of the exercise should be submitted to the present National Assembly for approval ._. It is thought that that idea should be totally ruled out ._. 
It is therefore suggested that the correct position should be to submit the outcome of the deliberation to the entire nation for approval in a referendum since the decision of the entire nation overrides that of any legislative body ._. It is however gratifying to note that the proposition of submitting the outcome to a referendum was not ruled out in the guidelines published by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation SGF ._. 
The SGF was reported as saying that the National Conference shall advise the Government on the legal framework ,_,  legal procedures and options for integrating the decisions and outcomes of the National Conference into theConstitution and laws of the country ._. The statement of the SGF is an improvement on the President's earlier stand where he was reported as saying that the outcome of the deliberations would be sent to the National Assembly for adoption ._. 
The adoption of the President's stand would either lead to undue delay or eventually kill the entire efforts ._. 
It is therefore suggested that the option of recommending the adoption through a referendum should be made at the conference ._. The point must however be made clear that the new Constitution should come into force before the national elections in 2015 ._. 
This is because extending the life span of the present Constitution beyond 2015 could lead to an unhealthy situation ._. 
Efforts should therefore be made to ensure that the reviews envisaged are concluded and made into a new Constitution which will be effective before the 2015 elections ._. Federal GovernmentThe present Constitution provides for two legislative chambers :_:  the Senate and the House of Representatives ._. There is need to consider i if we can make do with one house ,_,  ii whether the members should be full time or part time; and iii whether the President should appoint his ministers from among the members of the National Assembly as opposed to the present practice of looking out entirely when making his appointments ._. One point we have to consider is that under the present system ,_,  our legislators sit ,_,  during sessions ,_,  for only three days in a week ,_,  i e :_:  Tuesdays ,_,  Wednesdays and Thursdays ._. 
Legislative activities are duplicated in both chambres ._. 
There is the need to consider what dangers would arise if the considerations are done in one chambre and the members are made to be on part time as was the practice in the 1963 Constitution ._. The PresidentWhile the election of the members of the National Assembly could be retained as presently based on each constituency ,_,  that of the President should be made nationwide as in the present Constitution ._. 
To do otherwise ,_,  as was in the 1963 Constitution where the political party with majority of members in the National Assembly picked the Prime Minister ,_,  will pose great danger in that a situation could arise whereby a person so imposed by such means would not necessarily need to be known by or care to know anywhere outside the constituency that elected him into the National Assembly ._. There is ,_,  however ,_,  the need to consider the enormous cost of the presidential election and the need to find a way of reducing or pegging it and also fix the number of ministers ,_,  advisers ,_,  etc the President could appoint with a view to reducing the cost of governance ._. 
This idea should also be extended to legislators ,_,  Permanent Secretaries and heads of parastatals ._. Finally there is need to consider what dangers would arise if the ministers are appointed from among the members of the National assembly whereby such appointees would only be entitled to only additional fixed allowances for the additional duties placed on them as ministers ,_,  etc ._. State GovernmentThe present state and local government structures should be retained but subject to modifications aimed at cutting down costs ._. 
It is suggested that the legislators in the state Houses of Assembly and councilors in the local government areas should be on part time and the Governors are made to appoint their Commissioners from among elected members of the State House of Assembly ._. The number of advisers the Governor could appoint should also be pegged in the Constitution ._. 
At the local government level ,_,  only the Chairman could be on full time basis while the councilors should be on part -_: time basis ._. SecurityThe greatest threat to the nation today is insecurity ._. 
There is now almost total breakdown of law and order ._. 
Armed robbery ,_,  kidnapping and other heinous crimes occur daily in every part of the country ._. 
The new additions introduced by religious fanatics  -_:  otherwise known as Boko Haram -_:  has added a new dimension to insecurity ._. 
The question in everyone's mind is ,_,  how did we degenerate to this horrible level and what is the way outThe main duty of ensuring internal security in the country ,_,  as in all other countries of the world ,_,  is given exclusively to the Nigeria Police by Sect ._. 
214 of the 1999 Constitution as amended ._. The Force is put under the command of the Inspector General of Police and any contingent of the Nigeria Police Force stationed in a state shall ,_,  subject to the authority of the Inspector General of police ,_,  be under the command of the Commissioner of Police of that State Sect ._. 
2152 ._. 
The direction which the President may give to the Inspector General is specified in Sect ._. 
215 3 of the Constitution ._. It is restricted to such lawful directions with respect to the maintenance and security of public safety and public order as he may consider necessary ._.   ._. 
The Governor of a State is also empowered to give similar lawful directions with respect to the maintenance and securing of public safety and public order within the State to the Commissioner of Police in his State ._. The 1999 Constitution created two executive bodies to deal with police matters ._. 
They are i the Nigeria Police Council ,_,  and ii the Police Service Commission 3rd Schedule Sections 27 and 29 respectively ._. 
During the military administrations prior to the coming into force of the 1999 Constitution ,_,  appointments ,_,  promotions ,_,  etc ._.  into the Nigeria Police were made without any laid down principles ._. The Force was by that means heavily distorted in that merit and competence were not strictly followed ._. 
The effects of such deficiencies include indiscipline and low morale in the Force ._. But only the Police Service Commission was constituted and made functional since the coming into force of the 1999 Constitution ._. The Police Council created by the 1999 Constitution was not constituted as envisaged in the Constitution and as such the opportunity opened to the State Governors for inputs is not available to them ._. 
All efforts made by the Police Service Commission to fully correct the rots and defects in the Force while there was no Commission met a brick wall; a large number of incompetent officers who had been promoted to very senior positions could not be removed by the Commission without running into serious political implications that would be read it ._. Many Governors ,_,  particularly from the South ,_,  were also dissatisfied with the fact that Commissioners of Police posted to their states were mainly from the North ._. 
The Police Service Commission could not do much to correct the glaring anomaly in that promotions had to be mainly on seniority which had been distorted in favour of some zones in the country ._. However ,_,  a situation where the Commissioner of Police of a State is in open disagreement with the State Governor cannot be blamed on the President since he is not constitutionally responsible for appointing him for the State but the Police Service Commission who could re -_: deploy him if necessary ._. Way Out of InsecurityState Police should be ruled out as a possible solution to the problem of insecurity in the country ._. 
This is because doing that could lead to the breakup of the country ._. 
Although the Constitution is clear that only the Nigeria Police should be the sole police organization permitted in the country ,_,  the provision of the Constitution has been breached by the Federal Government and some state governments under different guises ._. On the federal side ,_,  the setting up of the Civil Defence Corps who are now armed and without any defined roles given to them in the Constitution is not only illegal but also constitutes unnecessary proliferation of fire -_: arms ._. 
Some states have also set up illegal bodies and give them different names but made to perform some of the duties of the police ._. 
In some states ,_,  they are even made to enforce arbitrary religious laws ._. There is need to examine whatever defects that are in the operations of the Nigeria Police that led to the calls for state police ._. 
The most glaring defect is in the over centralization of the command structure of the Force ._. The present system of posting Commissioners of Police ,_,  other officers and ranks to the States from the centre makes the Governors uncomfortable and feel insecure ._. In many cases ,_,  policemen posted to a state do not speak the local languages in the area where they are to operate ._. 
Their ability to fully interact with the people therefore becomes an uphill task and that massively affects their effectiveness ._. 
Although they are not being given the opportunity of playing their constitutional roles as members of the Police Council ,_,  the Governors are now major contributors to the needs of the police units within their states while the votes of the police provided for by the National Assembly are wrongly passed on to dissipate exclusively by 'Ministry of Police Affairs' instead of the Police Council  -_:  a body not known or provided for in the Constitution ,_,  and without any input by the Governors ._. The idea of state police should never be pursued as doing so will be very detrimental to the corporate existence of the country ._. 
An example of the arbitrary roles now being played on some of our highways by some state or local government revenue taskforce officials despite directives barring them from carrying out such roles can be imagined if state police are constitutionally constituted ._. Again the point must be clearly made that it is doubtful if any of the states as presently constituted is financially strong enough to set up and maintain an efficient police organization ._. 
The solution therefore is to decentralize the present Nigeria Police ._. 
The Civil Defence Corps should also be merged with the police ._. 
The most appropriate way of carrying out the decentralization is by recognizing the present six zones in the new Constitution ._. The police should then be deployed on zonal basis in such a way that the officers and rank and file in each zone should come from each zone ._. 
Each Zonal Command should be under the command of a DIG who should also come from the zone ._. The present constitutional roles of the Police Service Commission should be retained but with modification whereby that body should also be decentralized in such a way that each zone should have a sub -_: unit of the Commission which should be responsible for the recruitment ,_,  promotion ,_,  discipline ,_,  etc of the police in its zone ._. The Police Council should be made to play its constitutional roles while the Governors in each zone should be constituted into a Zonal Body of the Council whereby they could meet to discuss matters relating to the police units in their zone and chairmanship of such zonal council rotated among the Governors ._. The appointment of zonal DIGs should be made by the Central Police Service Commission but must be in consultation/recommendation with each zonal body while the promotions/appointments and postings of Commissioners of Police to each state should be made by the Zonal Police Service Commission in consultation with the Central Body ._. Apart from the roles which zones are to play in police matters ,_,  it is also necessary to transfer some of the powers now being exercised at the federal level to the zones so as to reduce the over concentration of powers at the federal level ._. 
Youths from the three senatorial districts of Edo State besieged the Benin -_: City residence of the two -_: time governor of the old Bendel State ,_,  Dr Samuel Ogbemudia ,_,  on Tuesday ,_,  calling on him to lead the search for Governor Adams Oshiomhole's successor in 2016 ._. The youths' visit did not come as a surprise to many who believe that Oshiomhole's transformation agenda for Edo State must not be tampered with after his exit in 2016 ._. 
Sunday Vanguard spoke with Ogbemudia after the youths' visit during which he bared his mind on some national issues ._. While commending President Goodluck Jonathan for setting up the on -_: going National Conference ,_,  the elder statesman ,_,  however ,_,  said there should not be no -_: go areas in discussions at the confab in order to find solution to the problems confronting Nigeria ._. 
He spoke on how Oshiomhole's successor should emerge ,_,  the security challenge in the North ,_,  oil theft ,_,  just as he predicted doom for Nigeria in the forthcoming World Cup in Brazil ._. Excerpts :_: How do you assess the on -_: going National Conference so farFirst of all ,_,  we must congratulate the President for having the courage to put together this conference ._. 
For decades ,_,  many people had been clamouring for a conference; many said they wanted sovereign conference ,_,  others said no ._.  I was opposed to sovereign conference because I did not think we should have two governments at the same time ._. Having said that ,_,  there is bound to be problem arising from the voting system at the conference ,_,  problem arising from how information should be passed on to members and how members can put up their motions ._. 
All these are expected but what is important is that the members that have been selected are people that I myself believe are supposed to be there ._. 
The exercise will be very successful and I hope that ,_,  by the end of the conference ,_,  Nigeria will be more united ._. But the President gave the condition that there are no -_: go areas ._. 
Are you comfortable with thatI think that the President has good reasons to say there should be no -_: go areas and the people themselves are interested in getting information as to why there should be no -_: go areas ._. 
So if there is any information that will help them they should give it to them; otherwise ,_,  as far as I am concerned ,_,  everything should be discussed ._. 
I have no fear that Nigeria will break up because those at the conference have no alternative to Nigeria ._. 
I have no fear because there is no where you will go that will be better than Nigeria ._. Some states in the North are still burning due to the activities of Boko Haram ,_,  Do you think that our military is getting its strategies rightThe issue of security coming to the conference cannot help because it is the President and the security architecture that can sit down and decide what option to take because what we are facing is really not a serious terrorism ,_,  it is urban guerilla and the people running its affairs are somewhere around the country ._. 
The people shooting the gun ,_,  I believe ,_,  going by my training and understanding ,_,  belong to the military wing of the main body ._. In that main body ,_,  you have those who are in charge of political issues ,_,  you have those who are in charge of rumour mongering ,_,  you have those who are handling matters of sabotage ,_,  they have publicity unit; so many units they are well organized ._. 
It is because the military wing is killing people ,_,  that is why we are paying so much attention to it ._. 
I think we should pay more attention to their publicity and propaganda which are also serious issues ._. Many people think the allegations and counter allegations between the Presidency and northern governors over the issue of Boko Haram are worrisomeI think the governors there can help the security to overcome the excesses of these people ._. 
They are the chief security officers of their states; therefore they have a duty to ensure the safety of their people ._. 
These are matters that there should be outside publicity; if I have serious suggestions ,_,  I will channel them properly ,_,  not on the pages of newspaper ,_,  it will not work ._. 2015 PresidencyI think we have passed that stage; there was a time they talked about the zoning system of the PDP ._. 
The argument went on and we agreed that President Jonathan should contest the election ._. 
So we have passed that stage ._. 
What is important now is for the North to negotiate with Jonathan on what they are going to get during his tenure so that they will not lose out completely ._. But do you sincerely believe Jonathan deserves second termWell he is doing the best he can and the best that Nigerians are making him to achieve ._. 
The issue of governance is not the issue of one person ,_,  he is not a sole administrator ._. 
If they want him to do more than he is doing ,_,  then they must assist him ._. 
I once discussed with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu that it is the duty of the opposition to assist the government by giving them what is called constructive criticism so that government can learn from it and he gave me an example of what they had done in that regard ._. 
So the country is moving in the right direction ._. Oil theft / dwindling allocationOil theft is not an issue of today ,_,  stealing of oil has been there since the day oil was found ._. 
One young man came to me some years back and said he was in charge of the records of the litres being pumped into ships and he found ,_,  in one particular case ,_,  that they pumped more than a man paid for and he reported the matter to his superiors but they removed him from that unit ._. Perhaps there should be a stringent law to check oil thievesThe laws are there but it is enforcement that is the problem ._. 
Somebody has to enforce the law; the law cannot enforce itself ._. 
But I believe that we should continue to train our law enforcement agents so that they can be straight forward ._. What is your take on the defection of National Assembly members from one party to the otherThe movement of individuals from one party to the other is an essential part of democracy ._. 
But if they don't want it that way ,_,  they must write it down in the Constitution that anybody who moves from one party to the other loses his position ._. 
Then people will have to think seriously before they move but at the moment ,_,  there is nothing like that ._. 
That is why they are moving for economic reasons ._. But the court ruled that they should vacate their seats ._. The lawmakers who defected must have read the temperature before they left and they know the consequences of abandoning their own party ._. 
The court of law interprets the law and if they are not satisfied with the judgment of the court ,_,  they will have to go to the next stage until they get to the Supreme Court ._. 
I think the court is right ,_,  so it is left for the lawmakers to know what to do ._. There is the fear that the APC might defeat the PDP in the 2015 presidential election ._. 
Do you have that fearAs far as I know ,_,  the PDP is the only organized party in this country; the others ,_,  although they might be together today ,_,  when it comes to sharing positions ,_,  crisis will set in and you will see them running about ._. 
But we will wait and see; as far as I know ,_,  everything that PDP needs to return to power has been put in place ._. 
They have registered their people ,_,  they are telling their people what to do ._. 
So any viable opposition should counter it and produce a superior program ._. What is your party ,_,  the PDP ,_,  doing to take over government in Edo StateThat is a policy matter ._. 
As far as I am concerned ,_,  myself and my group are working hard to ensure that Jonathan returns to power ,_,  that is all I am concerned with at the moment ._. But your group ,_,  the Enunuedo ,_,  has been agitating for a Benin governor after Oshiomhole ._. That is a Benin agenda which I support ._. 
Everything is being done to make sure that a Benin man with sufficient integrity and ability takes over from Oshiomhole ._. 
But many of us are beginning to modify that attitude that what the Benin people want is somebody who can develop the area ,_,  rather than a Benin man who may not be able to ._. 
So it is development that the Benin people want ,_,  they don't care where the governor comes from as long as the person can deliver the goods ._. What efforts are you making to get a credible candidateEvery day we take a critical look at each of the aspirants and draw our conclusions based on the information we have about them ._. 
So at the appropriate time the one that will be will emerge at the congress and we will support him based on his credentials ,_,  character and ability ._. 
There are lots of people with intimidating credentials but when it comes to doing the work they are disasters ._. 
We are already working on that ,_,  my group has pencilled down some names and we are talking and working quietly ._. We are going round to get information; at the end of the day ,_,  we will decide who to support ._. 
My dream for Edo is for the developmental strides of Oshiomhole to continue ._. 
My dream for Edo is to see that whoever is going to be there at Osadebey Avenue has the capacity to take the state as his constituency and then fulfil his campaign promises ,_,  otherwise he will find it difficult next time around ._. Did you entertain any doubt that Oshiomhole may not perform when he came as governorI have known Oshiomhole for a very long time ._. 
And as Minister of Labour ,_,  I worked very closely with him ._. 
And I have always convinced myself that he has all that is needed to galvanize people ,_,  to lead them and provide for them ._. 
And when he came ,_,  I felt that ,_,  well ,_,  let us see what he can do ,_,  and he has done wonderfully well ,_,  he has acquitted himself creditably well ._. 
God brought him at the right time for the people of Edo ._. How were you able to achieve so much as military governorGod was my leader ,_,  He led me throughout ._. 
At the same time ,_,  He made me believe that while in office ,_,  I must leave sufficient evidence of my tenure for historians to appreciate ,_,  so that many years later ,_,  the verdict of history will be favourable ._. 
And I am glad it is happening today ._. How was your allocation then likeFor four years programme then ,_,  the Midwest was allocated N700million ._. 
We did not have much ,_,  the highest I ever got was N300million a year ._. 
But ,_,  as God will do it ,_,  I had a very strong team which wanted to see development and they joined me to ensure that development really took place with the little money that was available ._. How were you able to build UNIBENUNIBEN came as a child of circumstance ._. 
The civil war was raging and the atmosphere was full with a signal that the war will come ._. 
Then one night ,_,  Ojukwu announced that all none Igbo living in the Eastern Region should leave as he could no longer guarantee their safety ._. 
And majority of Midwesterners left the area and came to Benin ._. 
So the streets were filled with students who were in their final year at the University of Nigeria ,_,  Nsukka and that caused us a lot of embarrassment ._. Many of them we sent overseas ,_,  others we had to find something for them ._. 
So we started by setting up an institution known as the Midwest Institution of Technology which later became University of Benin ._. 
They were a lot of opposition from people that the Midwest ought not to have a university and that Adeyemi College of Education was there for us ._. Unfortunately when our people went there ,_,  they did not admit all the people we sent; so getting our own university became very important and we had to build our own university ._. 
And the Commonwealth University Association ,_,  the Economic Commission for Africa helped us tremendously and that was how we built the university ._. After Ojukwu gave that order ,_,  did you try to reach him ,_,  maybe on phone ,_,  to know why he took that actionThere was no way I could reach him ._. 
I tried by telephone no way ,_,  but when the boys arrived and they told me what they went through ,_,  there was no need for me to bother Ojukwu ._. 
We made sure that our people were comfortable ,_,  that they got what they wanted and they went into the labour market for the development of Nigeria ._. People enjoyed bursary and scholarship during your time but those things no longer exist ._. 
Why And Bendel State was number one in sports during your time but those things suddenly disappeared ._. In my time ,_,  why bursary was necessary was that they were many children in the streets ._. 
So we either gave them bursary or scholarship to carry on their education ._. 
And for sports ,_,  there were reasons for the introduction of sports ._. 
The first was that there was a break in communication between the so -_: called true Midwesterners and Ibo speaking Midwesterners ._. There was a suspicion that the Ibo speaking Midwesterners were supporting Ojukwu and that when the secessionist troops entered the Midwest ,_,  they facilitated the entry ._. 
So what do we do We couldn't continue to rule and operate between divided people ._. 
So government had to make effort to build a united state from a divided people ._. Secondly ,_,  the youth ,_,  as we all know are the leaders of tomorrow; so what do we do to bring them together because they were already afraid to go beyond Agbor to come to Benin So we had to introduce sports and when they were playing football they forgot where they came from and everybody was cheering them ._. 
And gradually ,_,  it dawned on everybody that we were all one ._. At the same time ,_,  in order to remove the suspicion ,_,  I set up a rebel activities tribunal ._. 
So any body who had something against anybody went there to say it ._. 
By the time the tribunal ended its sitting ,_,  it became obvious that there was no Midwesterner guilty of betrayal ._. Reviving sportsReviving sports in Nigeria ,_,  government has to decide whether it requires sports for the purpose of exercises or recreation or you want to use sports to make more money and influence other countries ._. 
Once government takes that decision it will know what to do ._. If it is for recreation ,_,  we don't need more investments like we have today ,_,  but if it is for the purpose of getting more money through sports ,_,  organizing the people ,_,  unifying them ,_,  making them feel like one then we need massive investments in sports ._. 
And to invest ,_,  you need a people who understand what is happening and what they want to achieve to be in charge not anybody who has run hundred meters because you don't need to run to know how to organize sports ._. Sports managers in Nigeria must insist on training and every aspect of sports should be given equal attention ._. 
For example ,_,  football today is our major sports but they should give sprint the same attention they give to football; the same to with swimming ,_,  basketball ._. 
With all these together ,_,  the country will be respected abroad on sports ._. 
One gold in the Olympics will give you more publicity that you can ever write in any newspaper ._. Do you think Nigeria will do well in BrazilI don't think will do well ._. 
First of all ,_,  our people don't have the expertise ,_,  the techniques ._. 
Before a footballer will do well ,_,  he must be good and effective but what we have on the ground today ,_,  in my view ,_,  cannot win the World Cup ._. 
I don't want to wish them bad luck but what I am trying to say is that they have not trained enough ._. 
They can beat the minor teams but beyond that it will be difficult ._. But if they get to the quarter finals I will be very happy ,_,  but I am only telling you my fears ._. 
The coach is good ,_,  but I don't think Keshi has the free hand to do his selection or enough money to invest in training ._. 
I know Keshi very well and some of the boys playing now are not getting younger; so they are deteriorating ._. So they need 17 -_: year -_: old boys to train against the next Wold Cup and they should train daily ._. 
So our training need to be doubled and we need stamina; some of them don't have stamina anymore ._. 
For example ,_,  they put some girls under 17 to play World Cup ,_,  if you see them playing ,_,  you will be ashamed to be a Nigerian ._. 
So we must change our style ._. 
Skepticism continues to trail the on -_: going conference called by the President in Abuja to determine Nigeria's future path ._. 
There questions of the legitimacy of the conference ._. 
Such a question has been raised because there is no obvious constitutional backing for the conference ._. For the National Conference to convene there must be an act of parliament given it backing and legitimizing its outcomes ._. 
It would not be considered ,_,  properly speaking ,_,  a national conference ._. 
No article inherent to the section on presidential authority under the constitution gives the President of Nigeria any such powers to convene a National Conference ._. 
As have said ,_,  for a National Conference to take place ,_,  the national Assembly ,_,  and the Assemblies of the various constituent states ,_,  which under the Federalism principle are independent governments on their own ,_,  must give the necessary assent ._. So ,_,  properly speaking ,_,  what is currently going on in Abuja is the President's Conference ._. 
Its terms are not the terms of the Nigerian nation; it is the terms set down by the President of the federation for a body of people he has selected to discuss certain aspects of the National question that his office has determined to be important to the President's agenda ._. 
He has given his boundaries  -_:  the so -_: called No go areas  -_:  and such limiting grounds fit the president's rather narrow domestic agenda ._. The outcomes of this Presidential Conference on Nigeria will ultimately be for purely advisory rather than constitutional necessities ,_,  and is not binding on Nigerians ._. 
Nigerians had no hands in the election or selection of the conferees ,_,  most of whom were products of smoky backroom politics rather than clear citizens mandate ._. 
That ground itself constitutes the first delegitimizing principle and will ultimately cast doubts on the outcome of this conference ._. It is therefore quite right that critics of the on -_: going conference have grounds to describe it as a most expensive form of the talk -_: shop; a distraction ,_,  a short -_: cut to defusing the ignited fuse of the nation characterized by the massive anger in the land ._. 
But I did say once in this column that it is right for kinsmen to meet ._. Meetings ,_,  such as the one the president has called in Abuja ,_,  with all its profound flaws also have ways of throwing up important truths ._.  such a truth was dramatically conveyed in the first week of the Abuja conference by the Lamido of Adamawa ,_,  Muhmmadu Barkindo Mustapha ,_,  who in a fit of pique said he would take his people back to the cameroons from whence they came if Nigeria disintegrates ._. 
He has a home in the Cameroons ,_,  he said ,_,  which in fact has a greater portion of his Adamawa Kingdom or Emirate :_:  My Kingdom has been in existence hundreds of years before the so -_: called entity called Nigeria and the so -_: called civilized people from the West who are the people who came and divided us ._. The larger part of my kingdom is now in Cameroon and a part of it is named a state that is Adamawa State in Cameroon ._. 
If you go to Cameroon ,_,  you verify that ._. Two things struck me in the Lamido's statement :_:  the first is in the Adamawa monarch's description of the Nigerian nation  -_:  it is for him the so -_: called entity called Nigeria and the second is the claim of a greater suzerain space in Nigeria's neighbouring state of the Cameroons ,_,  with its own Adamawa State ._. I think the Lamido meant to sound a note of warning for those unlike him ,_,  who have options of alternate statehood; who may not be stuck in the collapsing Babel called Nigeria ,_,  with Moloch  -_:  its national god now baying for blood ._. 
But hidden beneath the threat of secession by the Lamido of Adamawa is history ._. 
Perhaps the Lamido does not quite remember ,_,  following the 1961 referendum ,_,  the people of the Adamawa areas voted to join Nigeria and be administered as part of its nation ._. It became known from 1961 as the Sarduana province ._. 
On the other hand ,_,  the people in the Southern cameroons ,_,  who were then part of the Eastern region ,_,  voted with their feet out of Nigeria ,_,  to join the Republic of Cameroon ._. 
Ahmadu Ahidjo ,_,  the Premier of the Cameroons at the time ,_,  who grew up in Nigeria ,_,  and basically had relatives ,_,  and possibly still has his family ties in Northern Nigeria did sign the treaty ._. 
My point is that Adamawa to all intents and purposes ceased to be a part of the Cameroons ._. It is true that colonial boundaries fragmented many old kingdoms and nations in Nigeria ,_,  and distributed them ,_,  with the scramble for Africa in new colonial nations ._. 
But as I have argued ,_,  nation and nationality are not permanent identities ._. 
National affiliations are determined by various factors ,_,  one of which only is ethnic coherence ._. 
But even ethnic coherence is no longer grounds for determining geography ._. 
As nations form ,_,  and as people travel ,_,  or are dispersed ,_,  or even subdued by conquest ._. There is not a single homogenous nation in the contemporary world ._. 
But that said ,_,  I think Nigeria has an obligation to offer the Lamido of Adamawa and the people of Adamawa ,_,  a chance to make that decision ,_,  through a referendum ,_,  about whether they wish to remain part of Nigeria or whether they wish to secede and join their common kin in the current Republic of Cameroon ._. 
This is important ._. 
Perhaps the Boko Haram insurgency might be in part connected to this attempt :_:  disenchanted nationalist groups ,_,  fighting to reshape and restore old principalities in the old Kanem Bornu or Adamawa areas with their cross -_: border affiliations ._. We do not yet know with certainty ,_,  and we may never know yet with certainty because the Nigerian National Intelligence and Security apparatus is weak ,_,  and has transnational loyalties ._. 
This is a matter for another discussion ,_,  but the Lamido has only just given us an important food to chew on ,_,  and while we are chewing our cud on it ,_,  let me put this quite simply :_: The Adamawa must be given the right or option to secede if that is the wish of the people of Adamawa ._. 
But that decision must never be on the say -_: so of an old and irrelevant institution like the monarchy of Adamawa which is ,_,  by the very construct of Nigeria as a constitutional Republic ,_,  something of a quaint anachronism ._. 
It must be on the strength of a properly organized plebiscite ._. If on the other hand Nigeria were to be a forward looking nation ,_,  its Foreign and National Commissions should have thought up something of the Adamawa Purchase and the Bakassi Purchase  -_:  akin to its own Louisiana Purchase which took up what was then called New France  -_:  practically the whole of what is now Western United States from Louisiana to Minnesota and as far West as Montana then under French rule  -_:  and integrated it with the United States to expand its geographical and economic frontiers ._. Nigeria could make the Cameroons a great offer to purchase the Cameroonian part of Adamawa ,_,  and the Bakassi Peninsula  -_:  and integrate them ,_,  and expand the geographic and economic frontiers of Nigeria ._. 
Nigeria should be moving towards a West African expansion to integrate those parts of the Egun ,_,  the Yoruba ,_,  the Benin ,_,  and such people with historical ties with core communities in Nigeria ,_,  for greater economic and social viability and peace in the region ._. 
But it seems that Nigerians have been distracted by powerful forces seeking to control its center purely for narrow self -_:  interest ,_,  rather than for long lasting and shared national interests ,_,  but for purely old ,_,  primordial interests and affiliations ._. No great thought is invested in creating a modern Nigerian nation ._. 
Nigeria is crippled by limited of ideas offered by limited minds who have limited visions of nation and nationhood ._. 
Such limits cause economic and social disparity ,_,  and therefore ,_,  disenchantment and rebellion ._. 
He showed the vibrancy of a middle aged person ._. 
Same could be said about his articulate ideas on life ,_,  nationhood ,_,  international affairs ,_,  among others ._. 
These uncommon attributes ,_,  displayed by Mr ._. 
Adisa Adeleye ,_,  in this interview in commemoration of his 80th birthday ,_,  left one doubting his age ._. 
But mistake should not be made about that ._. 
Adeleye was 80 yesterday ._. 
While this chat lasted ,_,  the economist ,_,  journalist and retired multi -_: national company executive in him ,_,  radiated ._. You just clocked 80 in a society where things rarely work and where life expectancy is abysmally low ._. 
How has the story beenI thank God for my life ._. 
I was born the North ,_,  precisely Jos where my parents were traders ._. 
I did elementary school at Saint Luke's Anglican School and Baptist Day School after which I left for my home town ,_,  Ogbomosho ._. 
I finished in Eko Boys High School in 1953 ._. 
I worked with UAC before I went abroad as a private student ._. 
At that time ,_,  we also struggled because we did all what children do ._. The survival rate was not high but we managed to survive ._. 
If I were to rate how it was then ,_,  I will give myself a bronze medal ._. 
But later when we came to Lagos ,_,  the crave for education ,_,  especially at the University of Ibadan was high ._. 
And the urge to further our education was there ._. 
So ,_,  some of us left for the United Kingdom for private studies at the University of London ._. 
I came back with a degree in economics ._. Entering into journalism ,_,  which I like much from secondary school ,_,  was a decision I made ._. 
I wanted to get into Daily Times Newspapers when I left secondary school but it was not possible ._. 
With the strength of my school certificate result in English ,_,  I wanted to get a scholarship to study journalism but it did not work ._. 
So I went to study economics ._. 
And economics had been a field of study I like ._. It was new as a field of study in Nigeria in the 1950s ._. 
It was not taught as a degree then but as an elective course ._. 
I came back and got into journalism ,_,  then I later left journalism for the oil sector where I saw how Nigeria works in many ways ._. 
During my time in journalism ,_,  hardly could you see any article on the oil industry ._. 
I started commercial reporting ,_,  which is now known as business reporting in Daily Times ._. Having worked in places of enlightenment ,_,  I found myself in the oil sector ,_,  where I worked in different managerial capacities ._. 
I got interested in politics after retirement in 1989 ._. 
I did not go far because I discovered that it was a jungle and you have to be able to adapt yourself to jungle life for you to succeed and I don't think I was set for that ._. 
I was a senatorial candidate of the NRC in Oyo North ,_,  but I opted out ._. 
I left the political scene because of absence of principles and ideologies ._. You have a robust experience in journalism ,_,  that makes one to wonder what could have made someone with a degree in economics in the 1960s to have opted for journalism in an era when there were good jobs for graduatesI was reading London Times after having my degree ._. 
I discovered that their top editors had different degrees which were not related to journalism ._. 
I said to myself that if these people could go into journalism with their different degrees ,_,  the profession will be enriched ._. 
That was how I did a diploma in journalism ._. 
It was that qualification that got me a job in Daily Times ._. I started writing quality editorials and eventually pioneered commercial/business reporting in Nigeria ,_,  where we carried stock news and started to analyse budgets ._. 
I could remember a budget analysis which I wrote then ._. 
It made the then Finance Minister ,_,  the late Chief Festus Okotie Eboh ,_,  to order for my arrest ._. 
When they came to our office ,_,  they arrested me and my Editor ,_,  who was the late Alhaji Odunewu ._. We were taken to Okotie -_: Eboh office where he said that we were irresponsible journalists ._. 
He also said that we were divulging information in the budget ._. 
I responded that we were not doing such ._. 
And that Nigeria's budget then ,_,  was just centred on tax increment ,_,  increment of import duties ._. That made the economy so simple then because the manufacturing base was so low ._. 
The encounter ended on a good note ._. 
I also did something about the economic prospects of Obudu Ranch in1965 ,_,  and I am happy that what I foresaw then has become a reality today ._. As someone who pioneered commercial reporting in the country ,_,  how do you feel when you open the pages of newspapers and find a lot of pages allocated to business reportingI am so happy that many newspapers have embraced that ._. 
That is very good because people should know many things about the economy ._. 
Otherwise we will be living in ignorance ._. 
For instance ,_,  the sort of confusion about subsidy should not have come up if people had in -_: depth knowledge about the economy ._. 
I remember I once wrote about sensible economics in my column ._. That implies how one can use knowledge of economics to turn economic factors to his favour ._. 
I don't think it is right for an import dependent nation to have a fixed foreign exchange regime ._. 
If you are wise ,_,  you will make your currency strong so that you will be able to import what you need ._. 
But if your currency is weak or depreciated ,_,  then you will need more money to import ._. Our oil is sold for less than one hundred dollars and it is being refined abroad ,_,  while you say that the cost of landing is one hundred and forty naira ._. 
I have never seen a nation that produces oil ,_,  sells and imports ._. 
Before government took over the downstream sector ,_,  we will sit down and know the structure of the market here and predict demand ._. If it is gasoline or diesel that we need per day ,_,  we will calculate that through a formula and go to the refinery and collect our product ._. 
No body will be going to buy oil ,_,  product by product because you get so many by -_: products from each barrel ._. 
What is going on now is economic sabotage ._. Many people who read your column and know the ideas you postulate would want to know the secret behind this ability to write with the zeal and vibrancy of a young man at 80I am still active because I don't want to disappoint the nation ._. 
Education facilities have expanded ,_,  and ,_,  when you write ,_,  you have to consider your readers ,_,  so you have to think how they think ._. 
And you have to be able to convince them that you know what you are talking about ._. 
I also thank God that I have a very rich library ._. 
I write without basic knowledge about what I am writing about ._. Sometimes ago ,_,  I added my voice to the Crimea crisis ,_,  because I remembered something that happened 50 years ago when I graduated in 1963 ._. 
We discussed the Crimea war at a tutorial class in 1962 ._. 
When I was in Daily Times ,_,  I wrote an article where I discovered the British fears about Rhodesia becoming a communist country ._. 
My argument was that Britain blundered on Crimea and might find themselves with the same consequences if they repeated same with Rhodesia ._. And I remember a colleague then asking what I knew about Crimean war ._. 
I told him that the war was brought to the doors of Russia by Britain and France and it was just to humiliate Russia ._. 
Britain was thinking that breaking up that area will make Russia to interfere with the trade route of India ._. 
It was the same thing that is playing out now ._. 
Ukraine used to be part of Russian empire and NATO is trying to build bases around there now ._. I am not saying that Russia took a legal and rightful position by annexing Crimea ,_,  but what will be the reaction if you don't want a hostile neighbour and you are now doing the same thing to Ukraine So it is all about balance of power in Europe ,_,  with actors wanting to remain relevant ._. 
So ,_,  this is how extensive reading helps to keep me informed about world affairs ._. 
With an in -_: depth knowledge about issues ,_,  people and events ,_,  one will remain active in the society ._. You experienced the fruitful and promising periods in Nigeria ._. 
Today ,_,  the country is unable to find its feet ._. 
So bad it is that the teething problems of nationhood are still common ._. 
What does that imply to youMy observation is that we missed our opportunities through the kind of politics we play ._. 
After independence ,_,  we thought we had everything whereas the infrastructures were underdeveloped and when independence came we tried to assert ourselves ._. 
So our donor agencies felt we were okay ,_,  that is why nobody wanted to help ._. 
Every body wanted to trade with us and get as much advantage they could get ._. Unfortunately we did not organise ourselves well ._. 
And that led to the war in the first decade of independence ._. 
The politics we play affected our progress ._. 
We did not understand the party politics we played well ._. 
And our colonial masters tried to help by bringing the idea of a national government before independence ._. 
And if you study the independence constitution ,_,  it created rooms for working together ._. Are you talking about the 1960 ConstitutionYes ,_,  it was a federal constitution ._. 
Before then ,_,  there was a national government ._. 
And if you see the Federal Government of the pre -_: independent Nigeria ,_,  you will discover that it had representatives from the various regions ._. 
The NCNC ,_,  AG and NPC sent representatives to the central government ._. 
These people represented their regions at the centre ._. The British people felt that if we followed that kind of party politics ,_,  we might have problems ._. 
That is why they suggested that there should be national government at the centre ._. 
But we had government and the opposition which could not see eye to eye at the centre ._. 
Awolowo was jailed ,_,  while the Western region was boiling ._. 
The parliamentary system was abandoned in 1979 and the presidential system came without the American system ._. The United States constitution vested much powers in the states ,_,  leaving the federal government with defence ,_,  currency and international relations ._. 
But real development is buried in each state ._. 
Here the Federal Government is the greatest power ._. 
They dictate so much that no state is viable now ._. 
The states have to go to Abuja to collect monthly allocations ._. 
You don't run a federation like that ._. Lately I have been writing on Switzerland where there is a loose federation ._. 
The Federal Government there is a coalition of five different parties ._. 
The President retires years ago and no single party rules ._. Are you saying that what they have is a confederation and do you suggest such for Nigeria ,_,  in view of the myriad of institutional problems in the countryIt is a confederal system ._. 
Their Federal Government is composed of five parties and there is no one cheating the other ._. 
The election into the federal parliament is proportional ._. 
If you score 12 million and I score 18 million ,_,  the 18 million rules under the parliamentary system ,_,  what happens to the 12 million under the federal system You create danger when you exclude people ._. So what we are doing is a type of government where the PDP takes all because they are in power ._. 
We created the situation where the opposition wants to get rid of the ruling party ._. 
What I am saying is that the spirit of federalism allows each area the opportunity to have a say in the overall policy -_: making process in the country ._. 
To achieve that ,_,  there should be a coalition at the centre just like the old system where regional governments sent representatives to the centre ._. 
There should be stronger regions with a weak centre ._. The centre may become stronger when foreign affairs dominate ._. 
But the actual workings of government rest on the states ._. 
Let each zone develop at its pace by having its own institutions ,_,  so that only difficult cases come to the centre ._. 
You can never get peace under the present arrangement in Nigeria ._. 
We saw how the former Rivers State police commissioner ruled the state for a long time ._. Although the governor is responsible for security ,_,  the security apparatus is with the Federal Government ._. 
The police is under the states in all federal arrangements ._. 
Why is it different in Nigeria If there is a problem now ,_,  Fashola cannot dictate to the Lagos State police commissioner ._. 
That is why Boko Haram can flourish ._. You support the on -_: going National Conference ._. 
But from what you have seen so far from deliberations by the delegates ,_,  are you impressed and do you see them coming up with something that can launch the country to the next levelI will commend President Jonathan for having the courage to set it up ._. 
But by setting it up ,_,  he has to be extremely careful ._. 
If it was set up to achieve something concrete ,_,  that is good ._. 
But if it was done with a view to making delegates talk without results at the end ,_,  then he will have to reap the consequences ._. For instance ,_,  when the states describe oil resources as their oil ,_,  the Federal Government says the oil belongs to Nigeria ._. 
The militants started their war because of resource control ,_,  now they are silent and they are not controlling anything ._. 
The identities of the suspected Boko Haram detainees that were killed last week at the Abuja headquarters of the State Security Services SSS in what the security outfit said was a foiled jailbreak attempt ,_,  have remained hidden a week after the incident ._. Twenty -_: one inmates were killed last Sunday when they reportedly attempted to escape from the SSS detention facility after one of them had overpowered a guard and seized his rifle ._. Two personnel of the security agency were injured in the incident ,_,  spokeswoman of the SSS ,_,  Marilyn Oga ,_,  had said ._. 
The remains of the 21 suspects were later deposited at the National Hospital in Abuja ._. The SSS did not ,_,  however ,_,  disclose the identities of the inmates ,_,  provide details as to the time and places of their arrest or their respective positions in the hierarchy of the terrorist group ._. When Sunday Trust visited the National Hospital ,_,  officials said SSS had deposited the bodies at the morgue without leaving any information which could be used to identify them individually ._. The official ,_,  who did not give his name ,_,  said alphabets were attached to each of the bodies ,_,  as they were brought to the hospital ,_,  adding that only the SSS knew what the letters stood for ._. They deposited the bodies with us ,_,  but they did not tell us who they are and all of them had letters pinned to them ,_,  but no one here can tell you what that means ,_,  he said ._. Similarly ,_,  officials at the mortuary informed Sunday Trust that nobody had come forward to identify or claim any of the bodies ._. The spokesperson of the National Hospital ,_,  Dr Tayo Haastrup ,_,  said the hospital had no knowledge of the individual suspects other than what Marilyn Oga had disclosed to the media about them ._. Following the March 30 jailbreak attempt at the headquarters of the Department of State Security DSS also known as the State Security Services SSS ,_,  there is fear of mass transfer of rank and files of operatives especially the top officers ,_,  it was learnt ._. A massive transfer of officers is under way at the headquarters of the State Security Services SSS following the embarrassment last week's attempted jailbreak has caused the presidency and the SSS management ,_,  a top security official has told Sunday Trust ._. The source said investigation had already been launched to unravel what exactly happened during the foiled jailbreak at the SSS headquarters last Sunday ._. 
He said two operatives were being probed for allegedly aiding the jailbreak attempt ._. According to him ,_,  the top management staff of the department had taken over the operations of the outfit to forestall future occurrence ._. The source added that the DSS did not lose any officer in the incident except that three of its men had been injured and were in a critical condition ._. 
He said the affected detainees were captured in Borno and Yobe states ._. Meanwhile ,_,  a Kaduna -_: based legal practitioner and former director of Kaduna Human Rights Association ,_,  Barrister Sadau Garba ,_,  has faulted the SSS for allowing detainees to languish in its custody for a long time ._. The lawyer said the security agency should be concerned with intelligence gathering instead of getting involved in areas that fall under the constitutional responsibilities of the police ._. Garba ,_,  who was asked if it was legal for the SSS to detain people for a long period of time ,_,  said :_:  I don't know of any law that gives SSS the legal right to arrest and detain multitude of Nigerians in their custody for endless period ._. 
Theirs should be covert operations by gathering and providing security information to the government or the police that have the power to arrest and prosecute under the Police Act ._. The lawyer also noted that the law had provided for suspects to be arraigned in court within reasonable time after their arrest ._. 
Under Section 35a ,_,  a person arrested and detained for an offence must be taken to court within a reasonable time ._. 
That is within 2 months for non -_: bailable offences ._. 
Other offences should within one or two days ,_,  he said ._. Amnesty International has done the right thing for calling a probe into the heartless and senseless mass killings taking place in Nigeria ,_,  since Nigerians are docile in taking any action ._. 
The Nigerian government must seriously wake up to its responsibility of protecting lives and property of the Nigerian citizens ._. 
The SSS must keep to its statutory responsibilities and act within the provision of the 1999 Constitution ,_,  he added ._. In the same vein ,_,  a Kaduna -_: based constitutional lawyer ,_,  Festus Okoye ,_,  told our reporter that the SSS actually derived its powers to detain suspects for as long as it deemed fit under the 2013 amendment of the Terrorism Prohibition Act ._. 
The Act provides that suspects of terrorism are to be tried at Federal High Courts in the Federal Capital Territory FCT ,_,  hence they should be kept in the custody of the SSS or prisons in the capital city ._. According to Barrister Okoye ,_,  he had argued against that provision of the law because it contravened other sections of the country's penal code ._. 
In his presentation ,_,  he argued that ,_,  With the 2013 amendment of the Terrorism Prohibition Act ,_,  can it be said that a law that extinguishes completely the presumption of innocence and denies suspects in the criminal justice system their due process rights from the point of arrest till the conclusion of prosecution is justifiable in a democratic society My answer is no ._.  Our judges are reasonable and rational and must be trusted ._. 
It changes the presumption of innocence and destroys the entire corpus of our jurisprudence to legalize the use of ex -_: parte application for the detention of a suspect ad infinitum ._. With the escalation of the security challenges in the country ,_,  we have a situation where persons suspected of terrorism have been detained for over a period of one year without being taken to court ._. 
This is a clear violation of the Constitution and the Terrorism Prevention Act ,_,  2011 ._. 
The amendment made to the law does not take a retrospective effect and this is clear to all discerning individuals and the government ._. For instance ,_,  on the 10th day of January 2014 ,_,  the Defence Headquarters said that President Goodluck Jonathan had ordered the release of 165 suspected terrorist ._. 
These are people arrested in the course of military operations against the Boko Haram in the North Eastern part of the country ._. The military spokesperson ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade ,_,  stated that over 165 persons apprehended in the course of military operations on terror in three states in the North -_: East are to be released from custody in compliance with Presidential directive ._. 
Nigerians were also informed that a 19 -_: member team comprising senior officers comprising the military ,_,  police ,_,  officials of Federal and State Ministries of Justice ,_,  Immigration ,_,  Prisons and Customs officers was set up by the DHQ in July ,_,  2013 ._. 
The team was saddled with the responsibility of examining ,_,  classifying and recommending appropriate actions against detainees apprehended during operations in the North East ._. 
On December 4 ,_,  2013 the team recommended that 500 out of almost 1 ,_,  400 of the Boko Haram suspects screened ,_,  face immediate trial ._. 
The team recommended the release of 167 of the detainees from detention and a review of about 614 inconclusive cases ._. The implication of all these is that all those released and those still in detention are being detained in violation of the law and the Constitution ._. 
The law has made adequate provisions for their prosecution and they should be given their due process rights and those whose rights have been violated through prolonged detention should be assisted to get their lives back ._. Barrister Okoye provided a solution to the situation thus ,_,  It is important that the security forces and agencies pay attention to the law and the constitution in carrying out their difficult task of fighting terror ._. 
Detention of people suspected of terror without quickly examining their cases and classifying them and releasing those that have no case to answer will further radicalize those detained without trial and win more converts to the cause of terror ._. 
With the new security challenges the country is facing there is the fundamental need to employ more State Counsel in the Federal and State Ministries of Justice to face the challenge of prosecuting the high number of terror suspects in the country ._. 
This is in addition to prosecuting high profile kidnappings ,_,  cyber crimes and oil bunkering offences ._. 
It is also important to train this category of State Counsel on the prosecution of complex cases requiring forensic knowledge and expertise ._. 
What's your opinion on the National Conference Does the Christian body have any agenda to promoteI will not tell you what the agenda of the Christian body is until it is made public in the conference ._. 
As I have always said ,_,  we need to pray ._. 
Some people will say 'but things are still rough with all the prayers' ,_,  but I tell you ,_,  Nigeria cannot survive without prayers ,_,  even for one week ._. 
Prayer is the glue that gums Nigeria together; if you remove that glue ,_,  Nigeria will break into pieces ._. 
Let us put aside tribal and religious sentiments ._. 
Nigeria has long awaited this conference; so ,_,  I advise that those who have not been chosen to attend the conference should take away malice and sentiments and pray for its success ._. You just spoke about tribal and religious sentiments ,_,  but these diversities are recognized in the selection of delegates and each of them has his agenda ._. 
Don't you think this could have a negative effect on the conferenceNigeria is the United States of Africa ._. 
That's why our diversities and language heterogeneity have not ,_,  all these years ,_,  disintegrated us ._. 
Like pieces of clothes in tailoring are able to allow themselves to be sewn together to form a beautiful dress ,_,  we should absorb and accommodate one another ._. 
That way ,_,  we will overcome ._. 
For instance ,_,  when the matter of gay was being deliberated ,_,  the way we joined forces despite our diversities helped us to conquer and outlaw it ._. 
On this national conference ,_,  I want to say that Nigeria is looking for solution and will get it with prayers ._. But many have argued that the national conference is in no way a solution to our plethoric problems and that Nigeria will disintegrate nevertheless ._. Those are called political statements ._. But some religious leaders are of the same opinion ._. Yes ,_,  that is because they are selfish; for the fact that they are not seeing yesterday and are not also looking to tomorrow ._. 
It looks rough now ,_,  but it shall be smooth ._. 
We are not together as one nation by accident ._. 
Lord Lugard may have made some mistake yesterday ,_,  but God's hand is in it ._. 
Even Boko Haram is not enough to frustrate us ._. 
We just have to speak up as one and against the killing of Nigerians ._. I told you from the beginning that Nigeria is the United States of Africa ._. 
Always remember that because it does not matter where we come from ._. 
In 1966/1967 ,_,  I fought in the Biafran war and one of our slogans was :_:  'To keep Nigeria one is a task that must be done' ._. 
We could have been able to let the Igbo go away ,_,  but we didn't because we still love them ._. Igbo ,_,  northerners and probably Niger Deltans have done things that could make the nation to say 'go' ,_,  but that has not happened ._. 
We must look at our existence with the eyes of God ._. 
The question is ,_,  what is God thinking about this nation; not what we are thinking about this nation ._. 
These people are telling us what they think about this nation but I tell you ,_,  it is who God says we are that matters ._. God speaks to His own ,_,  such as men of God like yourself; what is He saying or has shown you about NigeriaI have not seen splitting or disintegration bringing a solution to Nigeria ._. 
Let us do the analysis ._. 
The North and South split then the South is broken into three or four ,_,  making almost every tribe to become a nation ._. 
Then there's going to be an embassy ._. 
You have to take visa before you move from Lagos to Warri for example ._. If Edo decides to have its own embassy ,_,  you will then have to take a visa from Lagos and then another from Edo to get to Warri ._. 
We cannot imagine how bad it can be ._. 
What will happen then will be the case of a man who decides to let his wife go because of a quarrel and sees the woman three years later and begins to wish he did not let her go ._. 
What I love in Nigeria is the fact that unbelievers are here ,_,  Muslims are here ,_,  Christians are here and we are all able to stay together ._. 
If we can learn to respect one another's religion and respect one another as well ,_,  I believe we can forge ahead ._. Some prophets have also reeled out prophecies ,_,  declaring that the year 2015 will be disastrous for Nigeria if Goodluck Jonathan is re -_: elected; what do you make of thatHaving a dream for the entire country is not enough ._. 
You must confirm whether God is the one giving you that dream ._. 
Don't forget that the Western world is already manufacturing cameras and hiring offices within Nigeria so they can make big news out of their predicted dissolution of Nigeria in 2015 ._. 
Let me tell you something ,_,  Clemens Westerhof ,_,  one of Nigeria's former coaches ,_,  was asked when he returned to his country Holland about what he had to say about Nigeria and he said :_:  I learnt something from Nigeria and that is the fact that if they do not want something to happen and they pray to their God ,_,  they are able to change that thing overnight ._. You know ,_,  during the time of Babangida ,_,  there would have been civil war and people were going home already because Abiola was not allowed to be president ._. 
There was going to be real bloodshed ._. 
Some of us went into prayers declaring that affliction will not come to us the second time ,_,  and because of that prayer ,_,  the finger of God averted the war ,_,  and it shocked everyone ._. 
So ,_,  I want those men of God to go back and ask God if dissolution and disaster are His thoughts for Nigeria ._. Some people are of the opinion that the conference is to aid agenda 2015 for Jonathan while others are also condemning the amount of money spent on delegates ._. People do not know what is called 'leadership' ._. 
Do you know how much it is to for instance to invite a man of my caliber to go and spend days ,_,  weeks and months somewhereBut you can do that free of charge for your country ._.   ._. This case doesn't require gift because you're going to use your brain and spirit ._. 
The fact that those people agreed to go alone is very important because this conference will prove to the world that Nigeria can still sit down and talk face to face ._. 
It is a solution ._. 
Anytime there is problem and the two parties involved are not discussing ,_,  know that it is going to be bloody ._. By the time they talk ,_,  even if they are shouting during the first meeting ,_,  the second will be calmer ._. 
Whether anybody says it is another way of bringing the president in again ,_,  that is not a problem ._. 
The entire country was three regions :_:  Northern ,_,  Western and Eastern ._. 
One region became 19 states and all the rest two put together became 17 ._. 
We're in the game of numbers; so ,_,  tell me how Nigeria can create another state if the North says no ._. You earlier said Nigerians are blessed with the ability to overturn events through prayers; but why is the insurgency in the North escalating despite prayersPeople are very confused over this ,_,  but I know how God works ._. 
Sometimes ,_,  He allows things to happen so that His name can be glorified ._. 
You may not have known that those who set up Boko Haram to destroy the peace of Nigeria are on the run now ._. 
I have spoken several times about this ._. 
If it were not for God ,_,  the plan was to swallow up Nigeria ._. Are you insinuating that Boko Haram can't tear Nigeria apartNo ._. 
They can't do it and they know it ._. 
Boko Haram has its own temptations and they might have been bewitched to do what they are doing ._. 
Otherwise ,_,  a genuine Nigerian killing Nigerians would have felt it ,_,  no matter how bad he is ._. Nigeria just celebrated 100 years of existence which some people called frustrating amalgamation and some Nigerians were honoured ,_,  including the late General Sani Abacha ,_,  whose nomination was greatly criticized ._. 
Was that honour to Abacha deserving and does Nigeria really have any reason to celebrateBeing able to live for only one day calls for celebration ._. 
The fact that the place called Nigeria is still there as one entity for 100 years is a miracle ._. 
Nigeria has fought civil war where many young men died; I was there ._. 
That it could come back together is a miracle ._. 
Our existence calls for celebration ,_,  though it was done in a very low key ._. The fact that we did not take the grace of God for granted but went ahead to glorify His name despite our circumstances is more than enough to touch God's heart ._. 
The celebration alone can make God do wonders in this country ._. 
Did you know Nigeria before many of you were born Nigerians were eating only Uncle Ben's rice; not anyhow rice ._. 
The white people were coming to marry our daughters so they could become our citizens ._. This was why our first national anthem says 'Nigeria we hail thee ._.  ' ._. 
These were the Oyinbos hailing us ._. 
I remember when I traveled to Washington DC in 1979 to represent the Christian body ._. 
That was the time of Jimmy Carter ._. 
Some white ladies there were begging to take photographs with me and I said no !_.  Our fifty kobo was one dollar and when we were to return to Nigeria ,_,  we had nothing to do with dollars; we gave them out !_. 
People were coming into Nigeria from different parts of the world and were taking from us ._. 
But I'm telling you ,_,  Nigeria will rise again ._. At what point would you say things went wrong in this country and what do we do to get it rightNigeria was blessed ._. 
God doesn't joke with them where there is a multitude; remember the story of Jonah and Nineveh ._. 
Now ,_,  at what point did we get it wrong You know Nigeria was coming up shortly after the over -_: throw of the first military people and somehow God opened doors through our oil and the money was so much that we spent anyhow ._. We did not know how to manage that money ._. 
Hence ,_,  Awolowo was released unconditionally from prison so that he could show Nigerians how to divide the blessing ._. 
Money was actually distributed to the grassroots and everybody was happy ._. 
No armed robbery !_. 
Then ,_,  Nigeria said it needed to have a festival to glorify the devil ._. 
So ,_,  it invited every demon in Africa and we were celebrating Festac 1977 ._. They rounded off the festival and ,_,  when the people who came for the festival went home ,_,  the demon in the festival refused to go ._. 
You know what happened thereafter Nigeria Ports Authority ,_,  NPA ,_,  first went on strike; after that ,_,  it was students ._. 
Government started to settle with money until the Structural Adjustment Programme ,_,  SAP ,_,  came in ._. What do we do to go backWe must repent as a nation ._. But we have more churches and religious homes than we had in those daysWe're talking of genuine repentance ._. 
Since then ,_,  God has been waiting for somebody like Jonathan to come to lead ._. 
Every president of Nigeria was unique but you may not have known ._. 
People blame Babangida but it was Gowon who broke the relationship between Nigeria and Israel ._. 
Babangida was the one who came to restore the ties despite being a Muslim ._. 
Since then ,_,  no serving president has ever made attempt to go to Israel on pilgrimage ._. 
Gowon was a Christian and Obasanjo was a Christian too but they didn't go ._. 
It was Jonathan that decided to go ._. 
And I assure Nigeria ,_,  we will see a difference ._. 
At the British African Diaspora Conference ,_,  the theme of which was ,_,  NIGERIAN ENVIRONMENT ,_,  BEYOND POLITICS AND AMALGAMATION ,_,  organized by the AFRICAN PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ,_,  Delta State governor ,_,  Dr ._.  Emmanuel Uduaghan ,_,  grabbed his audience and took them through the developmental strides of his administration ._. The event ,_,  which took place ,_,  penultimate Tuesday ,_,  at the Grand Committee Room ,_,  House of Parliament ,_,  Westminster ,_,  London ,_,  UK ,_,  regarded as the second Debating Chamber of the House ,_,  saw a state governor who was at once deliberate in his presentation and expansive in the scope and vision of what Delta State should look like ._. 
In the chamber were parliamentarians ,_,  professionals and international journalists ._. 
To be fair ,_,  Uduaghan's seven -_: year old administration has more than delivered on his campaign promises ._. 
However ,_,  as he engages the last year of governance ,_,  what would be uppermost on his mind is how his successor would build on  -_:  and not dismantle  -_:  his legacy ._. 
This is the story of Dr ._.  Uduaghan ._. PROLOGUEHe came face to face with horror  -_:  this was some 25years ago ._. 
Dr ._.  Emmanuel Uduaghan ,_,  a medical doctor then ,_,  was hurriedly called to try and save a dying woman who was caught up in the pains and complications of child birth ._. 
When he got there  -_:  a hospital somewhere in Delta State  -_:  what I found was a woman ,_,  a dead woman ,_,  covered with cloth ,_,  he narrated to his captive audience inside the Grand Committee Room ,_,  House of Parliament ,_,  Westminster ,_,  London ,_,  UK ._. 
Though Uduaghan ,_,  who is today the Delta State governor ,_,  made it clear that this is not a story that I often enjoy telling; but it needs to be told so that people can appreciate where we are coming from and why a good healthcare delivery system is very paramount to my administration ._. 
When I pulled the cloth from her body ,_,  I discovered that it was lifeless ._. 
What happenedHe answered the question himself ._. 
He explained that the woman had not undergone the necessary antenatal care because of lack of funds ._. 
To make it worse ,_,  at the time of delivery ,_,  she went to hospital ,_,  was turned back because she was not registered ,_,  and found her way to a local hospital ._. 
There was no scan and ,_,  therefore ,_,  it was not possible to have discovered that the baby in the womb was not properly positioned for easy delivery  -_:  the child was bridged ,_,  because rather than come out with the head ,_,  it was the buttocks; the woman had lost strength and the child was still -_: born ._. 
That is the horror of poverty and lack of good medical care ._. A pall fell upon the chambers after this sordid tale ._. 
But Uduaghan then gave hope ._. 
That is why we have taken great pains to establish the General Hospital in Oghara ,_,  with state -_: of -_: the -_: art facilities ._. 
That is why medical care in Delta State is free for pregnant women and some other categories of dwellers in the state ._. THREE HOURS EARLIERJust three hours earlier ,_,  Uduaghan cut the picture of a day -_: time creature suddenly caught by the cold hands of darkness ._. 
With a slight shiver and cocooned in his robes ,_,  the Delta State governor sat in the middle section of a three -_: seater sofa in his hotel room in London ._. 
He was suffering from cold  -_:  call it flu ._. 
With a coterie of aides and appointees as well as two or three legislators milling around ,_,  Uduaghan welcomed his guests  -_:  four journalists ._. 
It was obvious that fatigue and weather had played a disturbing role on the health of the governor ._. 
He acknowledged greetings; engaged in a tete -_: a -_: tete and prepared for the event of the evening ._. THE BRITISH AFRICAN DIASPORA CONFERENCE 2014 ,_,  according to its organizers ,_,  African Partnership Development ,_,  is a programme for Africa with focus on Nigeria ,_,  especially at a time it is marking its 100th year of British amalgamation of the Southern and Northern Protectorates ._. 
Tunde Alabi ,_,  the Executive Director ,_,  welcomed participants and explained the giant strides of the body ._. 
It was the sixth session to be organized by Alabi's body ._. ENTER THE FEMALE PARLIAMENTARIANSCoincidentally ,_,  that was the same day the parliament was voting on the nation's budget ._. 
The significance of the budgetary event was that two prominent MPs were always in transit between the event and the voting chamber of the parliament ._. 
Meg Hillier ,_,  Chair of the ALL PARTY PARLIAMENTARY GROUP ,_,  a position she has held since 2010; and Chi Onwurah ,_,  MP for Newscastle -_: Upon -_: Tyne Central ,_,  had to make sorties between participating in the voting on the budget and the conference ._. 
Hillier said Nigeria held promise and this was discovered upon many visits to Nigeria ._. She ,_,  however ,_,  let food for thought regarding the trafficking of Nigerian women abroad  -_:  the country is the largest source ._. 
She believes the future is bright for Nigeria ._. For Onwurah ,_,  the prospect of Nigeria becoming one of the 10 rising economies in the world is a possibility ._. 
She supports a strong united Nigeria and she would love to have the socio -_: political and economic infrastructure in place as quickly as possible and would also like to see the country more prosperous ._. THE INSPIRING PARABLE OF A VILLAGE BOYUdughan spoke after his colleague ,_,  Aliyu Magatakarda Wamako of Sokoto State ,_,  had made some comments  -_:  the latter flew in from Washington DC just to make an appearance ._. The Delta governor grabbed his audience and took them on a historical voyage ._. 
From his presentation ,_,  it was obvious that the dress or the office does not necessarily make the man ._. 
What makes the man is the stuff he churns out ,_,  his disposition and his effective communication skills which should either present him as a charlatan in a powerful office ,_,  or a man of intellect who is transforming an office ._. 
Uduaghan is of the latter ._. Firstly ,_,  he stepped down from the podium where he sat although by the time he moved to the centre of the chamber ,_,  his true height was revealed ._. Clad in a white shirt ,_,  black tie ,_,  a black pair of suspenders and a black suite ,_,  Uduaghan embarked on his voyage  -_:  firstly about Nigeria's amalgamation history ,_,  post -_: independence journey ,_,  the discovery of crude oil ,_,  its effect on agricultural produce ,_,  the military coups ,_,  the imposition of unitarism ,_,  the effect of crude oil exploration on the Niger Delta and the issue of militancy in the area which he attributed to marginalisation ._. The very first sign that Uduaghan was communicating very effectively dawned on all when he relieved his childhood experience of how he would rush to the farm in the very early hours of the day to tap rubber ,_,  rush back home and prepare for elementary school  -_:  this was in early 1960s ._. 
His story made most faces long ,_,  some shot out of their necks in disbelief ,_,  glanced at the persons sitting next andimmediately refocused on the governor For his rise from grass to grace ,_,  it is fitting that he is in a bear -_: hug with the poor in his state ,_,  sopping to their needs ._. 'MY SUICIDE MISSION'About his administration ,_,  he said ,_,  The first thing is about economic development which we believe would help our politics Uduaghan drew a parallel between the need for gainful employment spurred by very active economic activities which his administration has engaged ,_,  and the reduction in militancy ,_,  insisting that when there is no hunger ,_,  there is no anger and ,_,  therefore ,_,  no violence ,_, adding that it is very difficult to recruit gainfully employed people for criminal activities ._. He lamented that most companies have left the Delta area because of environmental and infrastructural degradation ._. He made it clear that the unemployment crisis is real and a time -_: bomb ._. 
Therefore ,_,  his administration created an economic development environment to cater for youth employment ,_,  stressing ,_,  That is why we are involved in Delta Beyond Oil ._. On current challenges ,_,  the Delta governor enumerated the need for peace and security ,_,  infrastructure ,_,  and human capital development as issues being tackled by his administration ._. He noted that being a governor ,_,  upon taking oath of office ,_,  is a suicide mission ._. As a governor ,_,  I engaged some of the brains behind militancy or sent people to them ._. 
And with time ,_,  they began to believe in our commitment to developing the environment ,_,  provision of jobs ,_,  development of critical infrastructure and the demonstrable delivery of democracy dividends ,_,  Uduaghan stated ._. It was at that point that he told the painful story of the pregnant woman ._. 
Another tale of woe which he told was the embarrassment of confronting pupils in his very early days as governor ._. You visit some schools and naturally the students would get up to say in chorus  ,_, 'Good morning Mr ._. 
Governor' ._. Now ,_,  for me ,_,  it was very embarrassing because these were pupils you saw sitting on bare floor in what is called their classroom ._. 
After greeting you ,_,  the natural thing to do is to say they should sit down after acknowledging their greetings ._. But in all honesty and good conscience ,_,  how would I tell them to sit ,_,  when the only place they would return to is the floor  -_:  bare floorBut we have taken care of all that and we are still doing more ._. In the area of Diaspora involvement in the development of Nigeria and specifically Delta State ,_,  the governor said the State University Teaching Hospital ,_,  Oghara is a wonderful testament ._. 
With an imposing structure ,_,  state -_: of -_: the -_: art facilities and first class medical personnel  -_:  some of them brought in from abroad  -_:  Uduaghan has transformed the face of medical care in his state ._. Although he was quick to admit that whereas the attitude to work of the Diaspora doctors and medical personnel is rubbing off on their Nigerian counterparts ,_,  thereby providing excellent medical servicescomparable to anywhere in the world ,_,  he ,_,  nonetheless ,_,  explained that his administration is moving on by providing well -_: furnished General Hospitals as well as other medical institutions to cater for every category of our people ._. He also spoke about Delta State One Stop Shop for Investors DSOSSI ._. 
The governor did not leave out the leader of his party ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ._. 
He enumerated the achievements of the Jonathan administration ._. 
On the security challenges confronting the country ,_,  Uduaghan made it clear that the threat of Boko Haram predated the present regime but that the military has been able to confine it to three states ,_,  just as he stressed the improved operational capabilities of the military ._. 
On power ,_,  he told his audience that the once exclusive sector has been opened to private investors and ,_,  in due course ,_,  things would get better ._. 
But he made his audience understand that the unity of Nigeria is very dear to him and that it would do the nation a world of good if we all ensure the unity of the country ._. There were questions and comments ._. 
Ade Aminu ,_,  a Nigerian who is the acting Mayor ,_,  Lambert Borro ,_, appreciated the good works of the governor and urged for better relationship between Nigerians in the Diaspora and those back home ._. Before him ,_,  Sam Foxman of Developed Africa ,_,  another partnering group for the conference ,_,  said he believed small entrepreneurs could move the wheel of development much more that those big firms governments always focused on ._. 
He used Delta State as an example with its micro -_: credit scheme from where over 10 ,_, 000 persons have benefited and are into exportation of quite a number of items ._. Joe Okemena ,_,  UN Special Envoy on African Development ,_,  as well as Chair ,_,  Nigerians for Labour ,_,  a pressure group galvanizing to get more Nigerians on the ladder of the Labour Party and parliament ,_,  explained that some $200trillion is available annually for drawing from international development agencies ._. 
He ,_,  however ,_,  lamented that only about 30% is drawn down annually ._. 
He admonished the Nigerian authorities to endeavour to access the funds for the development of the country ._. THE CHALLENGE OF SUCCESSIONNow ,_,  even as he prepares to enter his last year in office as governor ,_,  it would be nice to come down to earth with Uduaghan ._. 
In a polity of clashing socio -_: political and economic interests ,_,  what is the succession agenda There are already agitations that zoning should be the order of the day ._. 
Yet ,_,  it has already manifested in the larger polity the danger which zoning without merit poses ._. During his presentation ,_,  the Delta governor made it clear that some of the policies in place have the backing of law so that continuity can be guaranteed ._. 
However ,_,  like the words of Alfonse Capone ,_,  you can go further with a kind word and a gun than just with a kind word  -_:  the governor should know what that means ._. 
Legislation alone does not guarantee continuity ._. The Asaba International Airport ,_,  the Delta Towers in Abuja adjudged as one of the best edifices in the skyline there; the 11 -_: storey High Court Complex that is under construction and is sure to be the best judicial complex in the country ,_,  the Teaching Hospital in Oghara which would still be expanded are projects dear to Udughan's heart ._. 
His Excellency would do well to allow popular participation rather than pander to the myopic sentiment of allocating his office par succession ._. Competence ,_,  unalloyed loyalty ,_,  understanding of the dynamics of governance as well as a strong commitment to and firm belief in the principles of his outgoing administration ,_,  garnished with popular acceptance ,_,  should be the abiding ingredients in engaging a succession plan ._. 
The governor knows the people working with and around him ._. 
He knows those to whom ,_,  with mass participation ,_,  he can entrust the reins of power to ,_,  come 2015 ._. 
It would be his call ._. 
Abuja's meddlesomeness would rear its head once again ._. 
To appreciate the issues raised herein ,_,  he should ,_,  for once ,_,  imagine what would have been his lot had any other person other than him taken over as governor of Delta State ._. 
A good man should not be denied the benefit of having a successor he believes in and in whom continuity is guaranteed ._. When the time comes ,_,  the call would be his  -_:  the burden ,_,  watts and all ._. 
Kaduna � A total of 10 ,_, 000 lawyers under the umbrella of Arewa Citizens Watch Initiative have resolved to offer legal aid free of charge to people arrested over alleged links to Boko Haram insurgents ._. About 50 lawyers representing Arewa Citizens Watch Initiatives ,_,  who attended a two -_: day seminar of northern youths and student leaders organized by Arewa Citizenship Action for Change ACAC in Kaduna State ,_,  made this decision known ._. Leader of the team ,_,  Barrister Aliyu Lemo ,_,  said the group will offer free legal services to people held by security forces allegedly in connection with terrorism ._. We shall apply to courts to issue an 'Order of Mandamus' compelling the Attorney General and Minister of Justice to take all suspects detained in connection with Boko Haram to court ,_,  he said ._. He maintained that the group was not in support of insurgents ,_,  but in those whose alleged involvement in terrorism has not been established ._. There are two sets of suspects arrested by security forces; the insurgents and those who are innocent ._. 
We are not in support of Boko Haram suspects ._. 
Let all Boko Haram suspects be prosecuted but the innocent should not be held without trial unnecessarily ._. 
Justice is a three way traffic; for the accused ,_,  the victim and the state ,_,  he said ._. Barrister Lemo ,_,  who works with Median Legal Consult ,_,  Abuja said the aim of the initiative with over 10 ,_, 000 lawyers ,_,  is to compel government to use rule of law in tackling insurgency ._. 
The lead story in yesterday's Sunday Trust set me thinking again as to what has become of human life in Nigeria and of the many events ,_,  persons and institutions that have contributed to this state of affairs ._. Sunday Trust reported that the corpses of 21 detainees killed in Sunday last week's melee at the headquarters of the Department of State Services DSS have been lying at the National Hospital's mortuary for a week and no one has come forward to claim any of them ._. 
Not just claim; no one so much as went to the mortuary to see the corpses and determine whether a missing relative or friend could be among them ._. Matters were not helped by the fact that DSS did not close to the hospital the identities of the dead men ._. 
Each of the bullet -_: riddled corpses was instead labelled with an alphabet ,_,  A ,_,  B ,_,  C etc ._.  Only DSS would know who A is ._. 
Why did National Hospital accept the corpses on the basis of contrived anonymity A man was held at DSS headquarters for months or even years for a suspected terrorist offence ._. 
He must had been repeatedly debriefed and the story of his entire life should be somewhere in DSS files ._. 
The probe was probably inconclusive ,_,  otherwise he should have been charged to court ._. 
After all ,_,  DSS charged Kabiru Sokoto to court for the Christmas Day bombing at Madalla ,_,  one of the single worst outrages in the whole Boko Haram insurgency ._. The dehumanising process actually began much earlier ,_,  with the indefinite detention of persons incommunicado ._. 
If men are held for suspected terrorist offences ,_,  DSS should ideally inform their families ._. 
I do not see how that compromises state security ._. 
In any case ,_,  since the men are being held so that investigations could take place ,_,  their friends and relatives should have found out about their detention in the course of the investigation ._. 
If no relative ,_,  friend ,_,  colleague or associate was ever contacted by DSS agents ,_,  the inescapable conclusion is that no investigation was taking place ._. 
Would men be held forever on suspicionBoko Haram is the biggest security problem to confront this country since the civil war ,_,  but I still do not see why the rules of detention this time are more Draconian than those in the days of military rule ._. 
Under the terms of the military -_: era State Security Detention of Persons Decree No 2 of 1984 ,_,  people could only be detained on the written orders of the Chief of Staff ,_,  Supreme Headquarters for a maximum period of six months ,_,  which could be renewed ._. 
How did it come about this time that a 2013 amendment to the Terrorism Prohibition Act permits DSS to detain persons indefinitely without charge This provision conflicts with the spirit and even letter of the 1999 Constitution ._. 
Any police agency that could simply hold persons in its cells indefinitely has no motivation at all to carry out investigations ._. Why is no one asking questions about the number and identity of people being detained not just by DSS but in various military facilities in the North East Some committee or another of the National Assembly should be asking such questions ._. 
Even if the details will not be disclosed on the House or Senate floor ,_,  members of a select committee should be furnished with such information on a regular basis ,_,  as we see in other lands ._. 
The CIA briefs congressional committees about even the most sensitive intelligence information ._. The courts too do not appear to be concerned with this matter even though human life and human liberty are central to democratic ethos ._. 
It reminds me of a passage in Arthur Hailey's 1954 book In High Places ,_,  which gave a small snippet about the Canadian judiciary ._. 
Where a person's liberty is involved ,_,  the matter cannot be left until the following day ._. 
If a person is in detention and his lawyer has good grounds to believe that his client should not spend the night in jail ,_,  a judge could be aroused from his bed at any hour to sit and review the case ._. 
The matter cannot be left until morning ,_,  when it could be determined that the person spent the night in jail unnecessarily ._. 
Compare that to what happens here ._. 
If the police want to punish you ,_,  they will wait until Friday afternoon to effect an arrest warrant so that you will spend the weekend in detention before you are taken to the judge on Monday morning ._. 
Assuming the judge then finds that you are innocent ,_,  what is the compensation for a weekend spent in jailThe Nigerian media too is not asking enough questions ._. 
The newspapers are satisfied to be told that 53 students were killed by Boko Haram ,_,  21 detainees died in a jailbreak and Five policemen were killed in an explosion ._. 
Who were they I often wonder why won't the police and the military humanise their own casualties and draw public sympathy for them by pushing stories about their widows and children ._. 
I can see that the Nigerian military and police do not want to admit that they suffered casualties ._. 
In the process ,_,  they created a situation where there is little public feeling for military or police casualties ._. One dehumanising episode leads to another ._. 
Amnesty International is now charging that after the March 14 attack on Maiduguri's Giwa Barracks ,_,  the military recaptured 600 fleeing detainees and summarily executed them ._. 
In that it had the collaboration of Civilian JTF members who ,_,  wielding clubs and machetes ,_,  help to round up the fleeing men and clubbed them to death ._. 
What about the possibility that some of them could be innocent I remember a lecture that the then Chief Judge of old Sokoto State Justice Umaru Kalgo delivered in the 1980s ,_,  where he said a judge would rather free ten guilty persons than convict one innocent person ._. 
That is especially true where the offence attracts capital punishment ._. 
What if at least one of the executed men at Giwa Barracks was innocentAnother observation is ,_,  the people of Maiduguri did not seem to cry foul over what happened ._. 
At the height of the insurgency ,_,  Borno Elders were quite vocal against abuses by the military in their operations against insurgents ._. 
Yet ,_,  600 people were killed in one morning and not a voice was raised against it ._. 
That could be due to the creeping feeling among many ,_,  if not most Nigerians that a Boko Haram suspect deserves summary death ._. 
Of course Boko Haram brought this public image disaster upon itself with the wholesale slaughter of students ,_,  villagers and highway travellers and the exploding of bombs in crowded civilian areas ._. 
I cannot remember one guerrilla group in recent human history that is as completely bereft of local community sympathy as Boko Haram ._. 
The Afghan Taliban ,_,  Somalia's Al -_: Shahab ,_,  the IRA and the Tamil Tigers all fared much better ._. Back to the question ,_,  why didn't anybody claim the DSS 21 corpses Every parent loves his child but there comes a time in life when a parent is forced to disown his child in order to save himself from societal opprobrium ._. 
Boko Haram insurgents have brought their parents to that critical point ._. 
It reminds me of a story a colleague once told me about a funeral he attended in Zaria ._. 
A highly respected man in the community received the news that his two grown up sons died in an accident on the Zaria -_: Kano road ._. 
Hundreds of people turned up at his house to await the corpses' arrival for burial ._. 
While they waited ,_,  rumours filtered in that the two boys did not die in an accident; that they attempted armed robbery on the highway and were shot by policemen ._. 
The story teller said one by one ,_,  all the mourners picked up their shoes and crawled away until the father was almost left alone ._. Maybe that is why no one is coming around to ask after the DSS 21 but that does not mean a state agency should not treat human lives with more decency than attaching alphabets to corpses ._. 
Maiduguri � Seven people including passengers and drivers were killed Saturday when suspected members of the Boko Haram blocked the Maiduguri -_:  Biu road ,_,  witnesses said ._. It was gathered that after the killing ,_,  the insurgents stormed Gwargube ,_,  a nearby village where they summoned the villagers and threatened them to cooperate or be killed ._. 
A youth vigilante member in the area said they were well armed ._. They stopped the vehicles and killed seven of the occupants ._. 
Many others were injured and taken to hospital in Maiduguri ._. 
In Gwargube ,_,  they vowed to kill the villagers and burn their properties if they cooperate with security operatives ._. 
They did not kill anyone there ,_,  he said ._. 
The Maiduguri -_:  Biu road had recorded several attacks in the past three years ._. 
Lafia ,_,  Zaria ,_,  Kano ,_,  Jos � The major concern before delegates at the ongoing national conference should be to focus attention on massacre of innocent civilians almost on a daily basis and to seek support of their colleagues to end it immediately ,_,  prominent northern elders told Daily Trust yesterday ._. Dr ._.  Paul Unongo ,_,  Malam Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa ,_,  Prof Ango Abdullahi ,_,  Barrister Solomon Dalong and Alhaji Abubakar Tsav expressed these views and many others when speaking in separate interviews with our reporters ._. Unongo ,_,  a former minister in Shehu Shagari's government said his heart bleeds that northern delegates will continue to sit on a conference while much of the region they are representing is gripped by a daily slaughter of innocent people ,_,  including women and children ._. It worried me that the delegates from the North do not even have the capacity to know that the area they are representing at the conference of handpicked persons ,_,  is deeply troubled ,_,  and has continually suffered from a daily massacre and slaughter of innocent people in large numbers ._. Is it that they are not capable of being bothered that we will wake up tomorrow to find out that there is no north because the flames of politically motivated violence unknown to the region will burn on continually when those who know continually remain passive ,_,  Unongo ,_,  asked ._. He told Daily Trust on phone that ,_,  acting in good conscience ,_,  Northern delegates have no business at the conference ._. 
Who are they still sitting there for ,_,  when the region they are representing is at the risk of being wiped out through carefully sponsored massacres of their constituents ._. By the time they are done with the sitting ,_,  if it is for the sake of the sitting and not the interests of their region; the political calculation would have been a done deal ._. 
Somebody is not thinking ,_,  lest we would have understood that something sinister and strange has come to the North; overnight ,_,  we have realised we do not need each other ,_,  and do not understand each other in this region ._. 
And it serves a purpose; which is that the people in this area do not love themselves ,_,  they love wars and are ungovernable; that we have religious problems and are backward ._. We have never had these kind of crises in the North; why now Somebody is not asking questions ._. 
We are only interested in sitting on a conference because we were handpicked and given the privilege which millions of our people do not have ,_,  Dr ._.  Unongo ,_,  who is also the leader of the Northern Elders' Forum ,_,  said ._. Former governor of old Kaduna State Malam Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa on his part said northern delegates should intimate their southern counterparts on the true situation of the insecurity challenges facing them ._. In a telephone interview ,_,  the elder statesman said Northern delegates should use the opportunity to narrate their predicament to their Southern counterparts ._. If they boycott it ,_,  the conference would go on because the president wants it ._. 
And in Nigeria ,_,  this is how politics of incumbency goes ._. 
This insecurity challenge facing us is a national matter and we are expecting responsible northern delegates to use this opportunity to enlighten responsible southerners on this problem facing the North so that a national solution can be given to it ._. When the Niger Delta crisis started ,_,  the people of the area took the rest of the people in confidence and that was why the level of degradation in the area was made to be national problem and they were able to get national sympathy ._. 
We too should use this to get the sympathy of the people of other region ._. 
Our delegates should take their southern counterpart in confidence on our plights ,_,  he said ._. The former governor said the people of the other parts of the country are not familiar with the true picture of the insecurity challenges facing the North and that as such they should be enlightened by the delegates at the conference ._. In spite of the loss of lives involved ,_,  in spite of the possibility of it becoming even more ,_,  there is now another worse thing ,_,  the cattle rustling ._. 
It has gone to the feature of terrorism as they are sacking a whole village and abducting women ,_,  this cattle rustling is also as murderous as Boko Haram if not more ._. 
Who is responsible for this Boko Haram and cattle rustling and for what purpose People are beginning to ask whether there is political objective to it ,_,  he said ._. Also ,_,  Barrister Solomon Dalong ,_,  a member of the Northern Elders Forum NEF ,_,  said the Northern Elders Summit had advised the delegates from the North to focus on issues that will help bring an end to the killings in the region ._. However ,_,  he described the unabated killings in the north as a calculated attempt to destabilise the region ahead of the 2015 general elections ._. Dalong who spoke to Daily Trust on phone said the federal government had shown little interest and concern with the killings adding that The President has not visited any of these areas where you here that over 140 people have been killed ._. 
Look at the manner of the attacks ,_,  they are usually well organised and the attackers are well armed ._. 
Then we have to look at the helicopter theory which has been mentioned in Katsina and Benue states ._. 
You will also look at the way the Fulani are being killed by soldiers ._. 
So ever since ,_,  I have mentioned the position that all these killings are calculated attempt to destabilize the north ._. Former Vice Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University ABU Professor Ango Abdullahi advised leaders of the region to rise up to their responsibilities and bring the menace to an end ._. Those who care for the North should talk about these ongoing killings in the region ._. 
A responsible leadership from the North should have risen to confront this impunity ._. 
The killings that are going on are very suspicious ._. 
Some of the governors have started saying so ._. Questions are being raised as regards to source of armoury ,_,  about the people moving around in soldiers' uniform killing Fulani and other Northerners in their towns and in large numbers ._. 
I think northerners must do something ,_,  Professor Ango said ._. On his part ,_,  Abubakar Tsav ,_,  former Lagos State police commissioner ,_,  said it is possible that Northern delegates on the conference will continue to sit there ,_,  unbothered about the massacres of their constituents because they are not ordinary northerners being killed on a daily bases ._. Are they bothered Are they common Northern villagers suffering the massacres They know they live in certain places where they cannot be touched because of their class ._. 
Even if trouble comes to their doorsteps ,_,  they have a way to escape it ._. 
They are men and women of many alternatives :_:  alternative power supply ,_,  alternative water supply through individual generator; alternative healthcare system ,_,  foreign schools for their children; and now ,_,  alternative security ._. 
They can leave their places at anytime and fly into Abuja and stay ._. 
They can run abroad ,_,  Tsav said ._. All Northern leaders have ran away from the trouble -_: hit areas because they are men and women of many alternatives ,_,  unlike their people ._. 
Now ,_,  at the National Conference ,_,  they cannot sit there with good conscience worrying about the same people they have abandoned to die ._. Tsav also slammed President Goodluck Jonathan for his trips across the country to receive defectors into the PDP ,_,  when in same states ,_,  the people do not sleep because of constant fear for their lives ._. I am not surprised at all that the president is preoccupied with hosting a conference that does not address the real problems of the Nigerian people ._. 
Nigerians are hungry and die from curable diseases; education has collapsed; electricity generation has fizzled out ._. 
Corruption and greed are now the only workable issues ._. 
These are our problems ,_,  not his conference ,_,  Tsav added ._. 
With the death of over 1 ,_, 200 Nigerians from January to March 2014 as a result of insurgency and counter -_: insurgency measures by the military ,_,  Nigeria now ranks high among the countries with high rates of deaths from insurgency in the world ,_,  Sunday Trust data analysis has revealed ._. Only last week ,_,  Amnesty International came up with a report which said over 1 ,_, 500 Nigerians have been killed in the first three months of this year ._. 
A collation of reported deaths done by this newspaper from January to March puts the death toll at about 1 ,_, 200 ,_,  across four states and the Federal Capital Territory ._. 
In January ,_,  there were 16 incidents in which 229 civilians were killed ,_,  98 insurgents died and five soldiers/policemen lost their lives ._. 
In February ,_,  there were 13 attacks ,_,  which left 338 civilians dead ,_,  eight insurgents killed and nine soldiers/police also killed ._. 
In the month of March ,_,  there were a total of 13 attacks ,_,  which left 219 civilians dead; 290 insurgents killed while 23 soldiers/policemen were also killed ._. 
In total ,_,  there were 43 incidents ,_,  786 civilians killed ,_,  396 insurgents eliminated ,_,  while 37 soldiers/policemen lost their lives ._. These figures may actually be conservative ,_,  as the military has continued to conceal the numbers of its men who lost their lives in encounters with insurgents ._. 
Also ,_,  if the allegation by Amnesty International that hundreds of suspected Boko Haram members detained in Giwa barracks in Maiduguri were killed during the insurgents attempt to free them last month ,_,  the death toll would be much higher than 1 ,_, 200 figure we obtained from newspaper reports over the last three months ._. From the above figures ,_,  Nigeria has suffered the highest number of deaths from January to March in countries where al -_: Qaeda -_: kind of insurgency has been prevalent in the last few years ._. 
These countries include Iraq ,_,  Afghanistan ,_,  and Pakistan ._. 
We did not include Syria and the Central African Republic CAR because the violence there may be considered as civil war ._. 
In Syria ,_,  anti -_: government elements are pitted in a bloody and destructive attempt to overthrow the government in power ,_,  while in the Central Africa Republic CAR ,_,  the conflict is an offshoot of a political face -_: off which has tailed into a religious battle ._. In Iraq ,_,  for instance ,_,  227 persons were killed in January from various attacks and counter -_: attacks by Shiite and Sunni sects ._. 
The highest number of deaths occurred on January 15 ,_,  2014 ,_,  when 40 persons were killed in a series of car bombs in Central Iraq ._. 
In the month of February ,_,  the number of persons killed in Iraq was put at 185 ,_,  while in March ,_,  147 persons were killed ._. 
On March 9 ,_,  2014 ,_,  the highest number of persons was killed ._. 
On that day ,_,  at least 45 persons were killed when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives -_: rigged mini -_: bus at a crowded checkpoint south of Baghdad ._. 
In all ,_,  a total of 559 deaths were recorded and reported in the international media ._. In Pakistan ,_,  where the Taliban are fighting the authorities and rival sects ,_,  the reported death toll from January to March is put at about 122 ,_,  with the highest incidence of violence occurring in February ._. 
At least 56 persons were killed in the month of February ._. 
However ,_,  the incident which claimed the highest number of deaths occurred on January 19 ,_,  which led to the death of 20 persons ._. 
According to Financial Times online publication ,_,  on that day ,_,  a powerful bomb ripped through a Pakistan army truck in the country's northern city of Bannu near the Afghan border on Sunday ,_,  killing at least 20 soldiers ,_,  according to senior intelligence and army officials ._. 
The explosion led to one of the largest number of casualties in a single Taliban strike against Pakistan's army ._. 
A month -_: by -_: month analysis by our reporter indicated that in January ,_,  38 persons were killed; February ,_,  56 were killed; while in March ,_,  30 persons lost their lives ._. 
The government of Pakistan has been involved in a long -_: drawn battle against the Taliban ,_,  which is linked to the sect that has its root in Afghanistan ._. In Afghanistan ,_,  where the Taliban has been at war with American forces and the local authorities over the years ,_,  the reported death toll from attacks by insurgents is put at about 93 ._. 
In January ,_,  28 persons were killed; in February ,_,  the number of deaths was 14 ,_,  and in March ,_,  the country witnessed the highest number of deaths since the beginning of 2014 ,_,  with as many as 47 being killed ._. 
The highest number of deaths during the period under review occurred on January 17 in which 21 persons were killed ._. 
In the January 17 attack ,_,  the head of the International Monetary Fund IMF in Afghanistan and four UN staff members were among as many as 21 people killed when a Taliban suicide squad burst into a Kabul restaurant on Friday evening and gunned down the diners ._. 
Two Britons were among the dead after the unusually violent attack at the heart of the heavily fortified diplomatic quarter ,_,  according to The Guardian of UK ._. 
The next in the rank of grievous attacks and deaths occurred on March 18 ,_,  2014 ,_,  when a suicide bomber riding a rickshaw blew himself up outside a checkpoint near a market in northern Afghanistan ._.  killing at least 17 civilians ,_,  according to TIME magazine online ._. Though attacks by Boko Haram on villages and other locations in cities have led to multiple deaths ,_,  experts have said the high rate of deaths in Nigeria is as a result of military operations ._. 
Amnesty International's 32 -_: page report on deaths in Nigeria from January to March 2014 blamed insurgents and the military for impunity ._. 
The report said ,_,  In 2014 ,_,  as attacks by Boko Haram intensified ,_,  the military has responded by stepping up its operations against Boko Haram camps in Borno state ._. 
In the first three months of the year ,_,  over 400 suspected Boko Haram members were killed in JTF raids and in firefights during Boko Haram attacks on towns ._. 
Thirty -_: Eight 38 civilians have also allegedly been killed by the military this year ._. 
In addition ,_,  at least 150 detainees died in military custody ._. 
On 19 March 2014 ,_,  Amnesty International received information that the military had bombed Kayamla village ,_,  killing 10 civilians ._. 
According to one staff at the State Specialist Hospital who spoke to six wounded people from the village ,_,  the fighter jet launched series of bombs on the village after community people had given information to the army that some Boko Haram fighters fleeing Maiduguri after the attack on Giwa barracks had passed through the village ._. 
Many villagers sustained injuries ._. 
When Amnesty International spoke to the hospital staff on Wednesday March 26 ,_,  2014 ,_,  he reported that two of the six wounded people had died in hospital from injuries sustained by fragments ._. The organisation added that ,_,  On Friday ,_,  14 March ,_,  at 7 am ,_,  Boko Haram members attacked the Giwa barracks in Maiduguri ,_,  Borno State and opened the cells to release the more than 1 ,_, 000 detainees ,_,  who were arrested under suspicion of being members or sympathisers of Boko Haram ._. 
A video released by Boko Haram shows gunmen entering the Giwa military barracks ,_,  setting ablaze scores of vehicles in the compound ,_,  before releasing hundreds of people ,_,  including women ,_,  children ._. 
Many of those released looked frail and were barefooted ._. Eyewitnesses told Amnesty International that the attackers came from a nearby village and crossed the Yedzaram River ._. 
A human rights defender interviewed by Amnesty International said the detainees told him that after their cells were opened by Boko Haram ,_,  the detainees were given the option of either joining the attackers or going home ._. 
Many of the detainees decided to go home ._. 
Boko Haram is said to have taken some of their members who were detained and then left Maiduguri ._. Last week ,_,  a new group called Borno -_: Yobe Peoples Forum addressed a press conference ,_,  in which it raised the alarm over civilian casualties in the attacks in the month of March ._. 
Some of the prominent sons and daughters of the area who attended the occasion include ,_,  Ambassador Babagana Kingibe ,_,  Ambassador Dauda Danladi ,_,  General Saleh Maina rtd ,_,  Alhaji Haruna Imam ,_,  Dr ._.  Shettima Mustapha ,_,  Adamu Ciroma ,_,  Senator Ahmed Zanna ,_,  Senator Ali Ndume ,_,  Alhaji Abubakra Mamu and Air Marshall Al -_: Amin Dagash ,_,  among others ._. The group stated that ,_,  In the last one month ,_,  Kawuri ,_,  Konduga ,_,  Izge ,_,  Bama ,_,  Michika ,_,  Buni Yadi ,_,  Mafa ,_,  Mainok ,_,  Jakana ,_,  Auno ,_,  Shuwa ,_,  Madagali ,_,  Malari ,_,  Wajonkoro ,_,  Ajigin ,_,  Benishiekh ,_,  Gamboru ,_,  Kalabalge have been attacked with heavy civilian casualties ._. As it were ,_,  these communities are a mixture of Christians and Muslims ,_,  hence the victims cut across the two major faiths in the North -_: East ._. 
The Borno -_: Yobe Peoples Forum ,_,  which called for an end to emergency rule even claimed that some 17 ,_, 000 lives had been lost as a result of the insurgency over the years ._. 
It therefore made a 14 -_: point recommendation to government ._. 
Among them is a demand that government should address the security and welfare of citizens ,_,  quoting Section 142b of the 1999 Constitution ,_,  which says ,_,  the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government ._. 
The group also appealed to government not to renew the state of emergency ,_,  which is billed to expire on April 19 ,_,  2014 ._. 
It also challenged government to un -_: mask the sponsor of the Boko Haram insurgents; thoroughly investigate human rights abuses ,_,  including alleged extra -_: judicial killings; expedite the trial of the security agents that were implicated in the extra -_: judicial killings of Mohammed Yusuf; security of borders with Cameroon ,_,  Chad and Niger; investigate the violation of the Nigerian airspace ,_,  among many other recommendations ._. As it were ,_,  the military has said it would investigate allegations of extra -_: judicial killings ._. 
According to a statement signed by Major -_: General Chris Olukolade at the weekend ,_,  the army was looking into the allegations contained in Amnesty International's report ,_,  saying ,_,  The claim contained in the Amnesty International's report attributing gross abuse of human rights of Nigerians to both the terrorists and the security forces is quite confounding ._. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the report is not consistent with the actual situation on ground ,_,  the security authorities will ensure that the allegations as it affects the government forces are duly investigated ._. 
This will be with a view to taking necessary action to address any case of human right breach on the part of troops ._. Meanwhile ,_,  Nigerians are once again assured that while carrying out the mandate of ridding the country of any vestige of terrorism ,_,  necessary efforts will continue to be made to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens ._. Achieving this would require a new approach to the fight against insurgency in Nigeria ._. 
Maiduguri � Hundreds of suspects were set free during what observers described as the deadliest encounter between Nigerian troops and Borno youth vigilantes ,_,  also known as 'Civilian JTF' on one hand and suspected members of the Boko Haram on the other ,_,  on Friday ,_,  March 14 ,_,  2014 at the 21 Armoured Brigade Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri ._. The invasion at the barracks ,_,  which was climaxed by a jailbreak ,_,  was enmeshed in serious bloodshed ._. 
It is believed to be the single worst incident in recent times because sources said over 500 people ,_,  most of them detainees ,_,  were killed as the Boko Haram imbroglio ,_,  which had claimed thousands of lives entered its fifth year ._. Among the dead are actual suspected terrorists who were picked by security operatives ,_,  either during confrontation or after careful intelligence work ._. However ,_,  there are hundreds of 'innocent people' ,_,  including women and children who were picked by security operatives over the years during cordon  -_:  and  -_:  search operations or mass arrest on the streets after an incident such as bomb blast or targeted killing ._. Another twist to the killings is that parents of both real and presumed suspects that were killed after the jailbreak have remained silent on the matter as no one was willing to talk ._. Many parents and relatives are still living in Maiduguri and in villages and towns across the state ,_,  but have preferred to maintain sealed lips ._. 
The fact is that nobody wants to claim any corpse that has to do with allegations relating to fundamentalism ,_,  may be because of the legal procedure attached to it ._. 
There is also the issue of stereotype ._. On the day of the incident ,_,  no one claimed any corpse ,_,  including many that littered the streets ._. 
And when dead bodies were evacuated and dumped in the front of mortuaries in hospitals; no one was there to claim any ._. It was after the corpses had started decomposing that authorities gave approval for environmental workers to offer mass burial in order to avert outbreak of epidemic ._. While the crisis is getting complicated by the day ,_,  many people are apprehensive about the way and manner the attack by Boko Haram militants at the Giwa Barracks was carried out and the way it was reportedly repelled by soldiers manning what is seen as the most heavily fortified military facility in Borno State ._. But days after the incident ,_,  a video released by Abubakar Shekau ,_,  the leader of the Boko Haram showed a vivid picture of how it all happened ._. Though the video could not be independently authenticated ,_,  it showed how the insurgents had a free sail into the Giwa Barracks and stayed there for a long time ._. 
The video by Shekau showed how hundreds of youths were set free ._. 
A man who claimed to be Abubakar Shekau ,_,  leader of the Boko Haram sect ,_,  said his group had emerged stronger after setting free must of their members ,_,  including top commanders ._. The one -_: and -_: a -_: half hour video showed Shekau wearing a life jacket on top of a white kaftan ._. 
He also wore black headgear and held an AK47 rifle on his left shoulder and some papers on the left ._. 
He intermittently spoke in Arabic ,_,  Hausa and English languages ._. The video also showed the level of sophistication of the Boko Haram in which a team of cameramen captured the step -_: by -_: step raid on Giwa Barracks ._. It also captured how the invaders ,_,  some in military uniforms and others in plain attires drove in chain of assorted pick up vehicles with mounted anti -_: aircraft missiles and found their way into the barracks through the rare perimeter fence ._. Dozens of the insurgents crawled into the precinct of the barracks and later showed how hundreds of captives ,_,  including young men and women coming out from detention cells were finding their way out of the barracks ._. Most of them looked emaciated as they strived to escape through various directions ._. 
Footages circulated by youth in Maiduguri a day after the incident showed how hundreds of the freed captives were intercepted at the gate of the barracks and surrounding residential areas ._. With the assistance of soldiers ,_,  they were waylaid by youths who brandished clubs of all kinds ,_,  and in the process ,_,  most of the freed suspects were shot dead by soldiers and others butchered by rampaging youths ._. Some of the insurgents who sneaked through the back of the barracks were killed by the fighter jet on their way to their enclave ._. 
But the video released by Shekau evidently showed that many of them had succeeded in getting to their hideouts ._. Widely viewed as a domestically focused extremist group that targets symbols of authority and villages ,_,  observers believe that such notion must be reviewed because the Boko Haram have so far entrenched humanitarian crisis in the North -_: East as thousands of people have lost their houses and source of livelihood ._. I think that Nigeria as a country must accept ownership of the crisis ._. 
Nigerian government must secure the people and stop these senseless killings ._. 
Nigerian army had secured other countries and should do that for vulnerable people at home ,_,  otherwise we will be left with no option than to see the federal government as an accomplice ,_,  Mohammed Dina ,_,  a lecturer in one of the higher institutions in Maiduguri ,_,  said ._. According to him ,_,  beside the military option ,_,  the North -_: East must be made to be economically viable ._. 
When I was asked in February to travel to northern Cameroon to do a report on the condition of Nigerian refugees who had fled Boko Haram insurgency in northeastern Nigeria to nearby Cameroon ,_,  I was excited ._. 
One ,_,  because I like doing exclusive human interest reports ,_,  and two ,_,  because I love adventure ._. 
And it was for the second reason that I travelled by road but a nasty encounter with Cameroonian gerndames turned the adventure into a nightmare ._. The ember sun was glidding leisurely behind the awesome ,_,  enchanting Mambilla plateau when we reached Mayo Dule ,_, the last border town on the Nigerian side ._. 
The rustic Fulani town snuggling at the plains of the plateau was lively with Fulani and Naija music ._. 
But we spent just some few minutes there -_: stretching our poky legs and munching bananas with fried groundnuts ._. 
We had been riding on bikes for two hours on a winding ,_,  dusty ,_,  bumpy path -_: snaking around hills and cliffs -_: coming from Gembu ,_,  the major town around the Nigerian -_: Cameroonian border in Taraba State ._. 
We had left Jalingo early in the morning that Tuesday and we were determined to cross over to Cameroon that same day ._. 
And by the time we reached the border it was already dusk ._. Welcome to paradise ,_,  a masculine voice boomed from the shadow of the thatched tent at the Cameroon border post ._. 
A burly policeman walked to the barricade ,_,  flashing his torch light and beckoning us to follow him to the tent ._. Give me your passport ,_,  my co -_: traveller ,_,  Joe said ._. 
I handed it to him and watched from behind as our papers were stamped amid exchange of banter in Fufulde and pidgin English between Joe and the immigration officer who called himself Paul Police ._. Officer ,_,  we hope say we go meet you here when we dey come back You be good man so we wan know you well ,_,  Joe said ._. No problem I dey ._. 
I be police officer for 39 years ,_,  that is why dey call me Paul Police and I don work for almost every post on the Nigerian border ._. 
I am from Maroua ,_,  the Far North Region ._. 
Are you Igbo or HausaNo we are from Central Nigeria ,_,  I am from Plateau while my friend is from Benue ,_,  Joe replied ,_,  dipping his hand in his pocket and fetching a thousand CFA note and tipping Paul Police ._. Una work am well ._. 
Once again ,_,  welcome to paradise ,_,  he said beaming with smiles ._. Officer wetin you mean by 'welcome to paradise' I asked ._. Well ,_,  Cameroon is a land of enjoyment ,_,  wherever you go it is enjoyment ._. 
From Yaounde to Ngaoundere; from Baffousam to Maroua ,_,  wherever you go you get good food and beautiful women ,_,  he said ._. We cackled with laughter and asked why he was alone afterall and he said his woman was on her way to his place ._. It was a pleasant encounter and we would have wanted the chitchat to go on and on but it was already dark and the road ahead of us was winding and lonely and we wanted to get to Mayo Darle in good time ._. 
So we climbed our bikes and continued the bumby ride on the Cameroon highland ._. 
The smell of cattle dung filled the cool night breeze and cows lowed as we rode past small ranches on the way ._. Soon we began to see light flickering from a distance in the dark night sky ._. 
I wanted to ask Joe if we were approaching Mayo Darle but he was behind me on a separate bike so we couldn't communicate ._. 
By then I was tired and hungry and homesick and I wanted to get to where I can eat ,_,  refresh and talk to my family ._. 
I had left Abuja two days back and I was already missing them ._. The trans -_: border bike ride from Gembu to Mayo Darle took approximately four hours and it costs us N3 ,_, 000 apiece ._. 
Joe was not a stranger in the small but lively town so we got along pretty well ._. Illiya Abdullahi ,_,  an innocent looking Fulani guy ,_,  who lives in Gembu and does trans -_: border business and also enjoys dual citizenship is a friend of Joe's and had called his friend ,_,  Rufai at Mayo Darle ,_,  informing him of our coming ._. 
So when we arrived that night ,_,  Rufai ,_,  another gentle ,_,  soft spoken ,_,  fair complexioned Fulani guy ,_,  was all over us ._. 
He treated us to a warm dinner at a local restuarant ,_,  where we were served a local delicacy -_: boiled spaghetti scrambled with eggs -_: and bread and tea ._. 
Then we were served chilled cocktail drink ,_,  Planet ,_,  a pineapple juice exclusively Cameroon ._. Welcome to paradise !_. 
Joe re -_: echoed ,_,  bursting into an infectious laughter as we finished our dinner and sauntered out of the restuarant ._. Rufai gave us Reactor ,_,  a caffeinated energy drink that we would get almost addicted to in the course of our journey ._. 
He helped us get Cameroon MTN simcards and recharge cards and while we were making calls back home ,_,  he arranged for a taxi that will take us to Banyo ._. Mayo Darle was enthralling at night ._. 
Brightly lit ,_,  it was booming with Makoussa and Fulani music ._. 
Youth strolled the streets in pairs ,_,  often holding hands and chatting animatedly either in French or Fufulde ._. 
We were told it was the National Youth Day across Cameroon and it was a night of indulgence in worldly pleasures ._. 
Rufai and friends asked us to spend the night with them but after explaining how far we were going ,_,  they decided it was best we slept at Banyo ._. We reached Banyo 10 :_: 45pm and by the time the taxi guy helped us get a hotel ,_,  it was almost midnight ._. 
We paid him 10 ,_,  000 CFA and parted ways ._. 
We slept for only five hours and dawn broke ._. 
We woke up ,_,  brushed ,_,  showered and got ready for the long trip to Ngaoundere ._. We were at the bus terminal in the heart of Banyo by 6 :_:  00am on the dot ._. 
We obtained 7 ,_,  000 CFA tickets respectively and sat in a nearby cafe for breakfast -_: bread sandwiched with scrambled eggs and tea ._. 
Before we could finish the meal ,_,  the booking clerk started to call out names of commuters ._. 
We gulped the tea quickly ,_,  packed the bread sandwich in a nylon bag ,_,  bought two bottles of reactor and planet juice and hopped on the Toyota coaster bus ._. We got ourselves the back seat and it was real tight there ,_,  but we were excited ._. TK ,_,  the real adventure has started ,_,  I am loving it and enjoying it so far ,_,  Joe said ._. I smiled back at him and said :_:  I thought we were not going to make it but here we are and by the grace of God we will get there ._. We chatted excitedly in the cacophony of the blaring bus stereo playing Fulani music and other passengers voices ,_,  as the heavily loaded bus snaked through the mountaineous road ._. After about five hours of travelling on the rough ,_,  untarred road ,_,  we reached Tibati ,_,  a fairly big town ,_,  which can boast of a national wild life park in the Adamoua region of the country ._. We alighted as we learnt of the one -_: hour stopover break ._. 
We went in search of food but we were not sure of the kind of food we wanted to eat so we settled for suya ._. 
Joe went to buy us drinks and he met corpulent Marie ,_,  an amicable but disillusioned single mother that would become our friend for the one -_: hour that we spent at Tibati ._. She told us she was from Bamenda ,_,  central region of Cameroon but relocated to Tibati when she got pregnant out of wedlock because her parents were mad at her ._. 
She said life in Tibati was dull and uneventful and getting by with her baby on the small provision shop she operated was tough ._. We also learnt from her that yams ,_,  cassava and rice are farmed extensively from Tibati down to Bamenda ._. 
We gave her lovely baby girl 500 CFA and promised to check on her on our way back ._. Bon voyage ,_,  she muttered in French ,_,  giving us the warmest of smiles ._. The journey continued throughout the day and we became hot ,_,  hungry ,_,  weary and miserable ._. 
We were covered with brown dust from head to toe and we were wondering just when the rough journey would end and we would have a cool shower ._. 
We were hungry but there was no good food along the villages that we passed on the way so we had to live on fried groundnuts ,_,  which we brought from Nigeria and drinks ._. By the time we reached Ngaoundere ,_,  it was 7pm and ,_,  to our dismay ,_,  we discovered that we still had another long stretch of the trip ahead of us -_: Ngaoundere to Maroua ._. 
We had asked questions ,_,  hoping to take flight or maybe a train ride farther north but we were told all the other transport services terminate at Ngaoundere ._. Joe yawned and stretched his long arms as we came off the bus ,_,  looking dirty and drained ._. Come on guy let's inject caffeine and get some strength ,_,  he said ,_,  managing a smile ._. Yes we need it ,_,  I replied ,_,  bring out my bottle of reactor from the side of my bag ._. 
I took gulps and I truely felt rejuvenated ._. 
Yes ,_,  the caffeine's started working ,_,  I said ._. Yeah ,_,  what we need now is a warm bath ,_,  good food and sound sleep ,_,  Joe added ._. Ngaoundere was glitzy even at night ,_,  at least by Cameroon standards ,_,  and we felt we would get good accomodation and good food ._. 
We lodged at Al Heer Hotel ,_,  close to the magnificent Catholic Cathedral ,_,  which I had planned to write about but now seemed impossible because we arrived too late ._. 
I had also planned to write about the Grand Mosque but for the same reason ,_,  I couldn't ._. 
I was just hoping that on my way back I would have the time to do that ._. As the capital of Adamoua region ,_,  Ngaoundere had well paved streets ,_,  a university ,_,  an airport and a railway terminal ._. 
It was a predominantly Fulani town with a 60 :_: 40 muslim -_: christian population ._. 
It was cool and lively and i was attracted to it but we came at night and left the following morning ._. We had been on the road for three days on the stretch -_: travelling on very rough roads in crammed buses across the hilly Adamoua region of Cameroon ._. 
We were heading far north -_: Maroua ,_,  where we would spend the night and the following day start the search for the refugee camps ._. We boarded Touristique Express from Ngaoundere to Maroua via Garoua ._. 
We parted with 12 ,_,  000 CFA for the two tickets and we waited for about an hour before the luxurious bus took off ._. While we were waiting we met one John ,_,  an Igbo trader ,_,  who told us Ngaoundere had large population of Nigerians and wished we stayed long enough to interact with our brothers and sisters ._. I was sandwiched between Joe and a plump ,_,  loquacious Cameroonian woman ,_,  who tried to chat us up but language barrier stood between us ._. 
I didn't understand a word of French and she too didn't understand a word of English ._. 
But she made me understand that most of the oranges they enjoy in the north of the country is brought from Nigeria ._. We were engrossed in our conversation we didn't notcied when the bust stopped and a Cameroon gerndame jumped in and started demanding for passengers identifications ._. We handed him my passport and Joe's Pass and immediately he saw the Nigerian passport ,_,  he started shouting in French that we should get down ,_,  we were illegal immigrants ._. Our fellow passengers asked us not to panic ,_,  that the gerndames were corrupt and will only collect 2 ,_, 000 CFA from us and well let us go ._. 
Joe being a security officer in Nigeria ,_,  asked me to sit down and confidently walked down to meet the gerndame ._. The chauffeur driver of the bus also disembarked the time Joe went down ,_,  but he returned without him ._. 
I began to get apprehensive and to my greatest shock ,_,  the bus took off without my friend ._. 
I shouted in English that the driver should stop but he did not pay attention to me ._. 
I got off angrily and wanted to go to the front and confront him but my co -_: passengers pacified me ,_,  insisting that my friend was not in danger ,_,  I should calm down ,_,  and that it was better I go on to Garoua and wait for him to come and meet me there ._. I did as I was advised but deep down I felt I had let my friend down ._. 
I shouldn't have left him alone ._. 
Afterall it was my trip and if anybody was going to suffer ,_,  it had to be me ._. Just as we reached Garoua ,_,  Joe called ,_,  asking me to go back to the checkpoint with some money because he had left his wallet with me and the gerndames were demanding for 60 ,_,  000 CFA bribe or they will incarcerate us and label us Boko Haram terrorists ._. My heart sank ._. 
Abdulraman ,_,  a Fulani guy who travels to Nigeria to buy motor parts ,_,  insisted I shouldn't go back there that I would aggravate the situation ,_,  arguing that once the gerndames saw that my friend doesn't have money to give them ,_,  they will release him ._. 
But I would rather take the place of my friend than abandon him ,_,  so I got a bike and went back to the checkpoint ._. Immediately I reached the checkpoint ,_,  the gerndame started hurling insults at me ._. 
I didn't hear much of what he was saying but I heard him mentioning Boko Haram ._. 
I was unfazed though ._. 
I tried to be brave and courageous so I was just smiling at him ,_,  while my friend explained to him in his smattering Fufulde that we were responsible people and it was wrong for him to arrest us when we had valid papers ._. He got angry and walked up to me and shoved me on the ground ,_,  threatening in English to beat me up ,_,  collect all our money and throw us in prison for alleged Boko Haram insurgency ._. 
He accussed me of running away and hiding the money we had so he was no longer collecting anything from us ._. 
That he would rather search us and collect whatever he wanted from us ._. Like joke ,_,  he dragged me up from my squatting position ,_,  rammed me against the neem tree by the roadside and started ransacking my jeans pockets ._. 
Tears welled up in my eyes but I decided I was not going to give him that pleasure of crying ._. 
He dished out two 10 ,_,  000 CFA notes from my pockets and walked away ._. Bastard ,_,  you think you are wise ._. 
I just want to show you that I am wiser than you ._. 
I would have dealt with you but I pity your friend ,_,  he said ._. He handed our papers back to my friend and we continued our journey ._. By the time we reached Maroua it was midnight and we were hungry ,_,  angry and downcast ._. 
We got a hotel and slept but not until we called our link ,_,  Baba Sama ,_,  and told him of our humiliating experience and of our arrival ._. 
He told us he was not in town but would return to meet us latest by 10 am in the morning ._. Laratami Philemon ,_,  59 ,_,  the manager at the small hotel where we slept was a jolly good fellow ,_,  whose humour was an elixir to our foul mood ._. 
So by the time Baba came we were in a better mood and ready to get to Minawao Refugee Camp ,_,  where thousands of Nigerians ,_,  who have fled Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria's North -_: East are taking refuge ._. Baba came with Moussa ,_,  who knew the location of the camp and agreed to take us there for 15 ,_,  000 CFA ._. 
We had a flat tyre on the way and by the time we reached the camp ,_,  it was past 3pm ._. Minawao camp is situated about four to five kilometres off the Maroua -_: Mokolo Road ._. 
A left turn at Zamay ,_,  a sleepy village about 75 kilometres from Maroua ,_,  took us to the open field in the village of Gadala where tents are erected to accomodate the thousands of Nigerian refugees ._. 
Minawao is some 100 kilometres from the Cameroon border with Nigeria ._. We understood that at least 30 percent of the refugee population are children ,_,  with at least 267 of them under five years ._. A recent report indicates that 3 ._. 5% percent of the children at the camp who are under six suffer from Severe Acute Malnutrition SAM while 8 ._. 5% of under 14 children living at the camp suffer from Moderate Acute Malnutrition MAM ._. Some aged men with facial marks that unmistakenly gave them up as Kanuris squat on mats under stunted trees with little shed ,_,  chewing kola nut and chatting in fluent Hausa ._. 
Their flowing gowns looked dirty and they wore long and lonesome faces ._. 
They were eager to narrate their nasty experiences ,_,  fleeing Nigeria to a foreign country ,_,  in the wake of mindless killings unleashed on their communities by suspected islamists Boko Haram extremists and the reactive victimisation of members of their communities by the Nigeria Military engaged to rid the northeast of the insurgents ,_,  but were afraid of one Ustaz ,_,  who had warned them against speaking to journalists ._. In fact ,_,  the Ustaz asked us to go back to Maroua and get written permission from one Jean Marie before we would be allowed to get interviews and take pictures ._. We took some picture surreptiously and while we were about to go ,_,  Utaz came with his men who looked like thugs or better still guerrilla fighters ,_,  to monitor us so that we will not talk to anybody and take pictures ._. 
I saw them coming and I hid my camera in the back of the drivers seat but Joe could not react quite as quick as I did so they came and snatched the other camera I had given him to be taking pictures for me ._. By the it was getting to 4pm we there and then made up our minds that we were not spending the night at Maroua ._. 
So we got back to town ,_,  took a night bus to Garoua and the following morning took a taxi to Yola straight ._. 
We made enquiries and discovered that despite state of emergency in Adamawa ,_,  it was safe to go to Yola from Garoua and we were quite happy when we came back to Nigeria after five hectic days across northern Cameroon ._. 
Boko Haram is both a serious challenge and manifestation of more profound threats to Nigeria's security ._. 
Unless the federal and state governments ,_,  and the region ,_,  develop and implement comprehensive plans to tackle not only insecurity but also the injustices that drive much of the troubles ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  or groups like it ,_,  will continue to destabilise large parts of the country ._. 
Yet ,_,  the government's response is largely military ,_,  and political will to do more than that appears entirely lacking ._.   -_:  International Crisis Group ,_,  April 3 ,_,  2014The advice from international agencies and partners ,_,  as well as from Nigerian civil society ,_,  is consistent ._. 
A primarily military approach to the very real threat from Boko Haram in the northeast will not work ,_,  and in fact ,_,  will only produce more human rights abuses and fuel the conflict ._. 
Nevertheless ,_,  there seem to be no signs of a change in de facto government policy ._. 
And Nigeria's major partners ,_,  such as the United States ,_,  have given decidedly mixed signals on the issue ,_,  with an official designation of Boko Haram as terrorist last November ,_,  and news that the U ._. S ._.  will be supplying additional training to Nigerian forces see links below ._. Unlike other conflicts in Africa ,_,  in which the United Nations ,_,  the African Union ,_,  and others play major roles ,_,  with the potential for greater accountability ,_,  the outcomes in Nigeria depend primarily on internal debates within Nigeria ,_,  in which hard -_: liners seem to have the effective upper hand ._. Nonetheless ,_,  the evidence is clear that the policies are promoting insecurity rather than security ._.

People are living in a climate of fear and insecurity ,_,  vulnerable to attack from Islamist armed group Boko Haram on the one hand and facing human rights violations at the hands of the very state security forces which should be protecting them ._. 
In light of this context ,_,  the ongoing intensity of the confrontation and the organisation of the clashing actors ,_,  Amnesty International considers the situation to be a non -_: international armed conflict ._. According to Amnesty International's research at least half of the deaths are civilians ,_,  killed in attacks by Boko Haram ._. 
More than 600 people ,_,  mainly former detainees ,_,  were killed by the security forces following the attack by Boko Haram on the military barracks in Maiduguri on 14 March ._. 
These killings amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes ._. Amnesty International is extremely concerned that Nigerian security forces and the Islamist armed group Boko Haram are committing serious violations of International Humanitarian Law IHL and human rights abuses amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity ._. 
There have been hundreds of unlawful killings ,_,  including scores of extrajudicial executions ,_,  and deliberate attacks on civilians ._. 
Thousands of detainees have been victims of torture and other cruel ,_,  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ._. Suspected Boko Haram members have launched a campaign of violence on the residents of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe states ._. 
A state of emergency was declared by President Goodluck Jonathan in these three states in May 2013 and was extended in November 2013 ._. The extension of the state of emergency has not helped to reduce the violence in northern Nigeria ._. 
Hundreds of people are dead ,_,  thousands of families have been separated and hundreds of thousands of people have fled the affected states and are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries or have been internally displaced ._. 
National and international humanitarian organisations have faced serious difficulties in reaching out to people in some parts of the affected region ._. 
As a result ,_,  thousands do not have access to emergency medical care and food supplies ._. 
Women ,_,  the elderly and children have been mostly affected ._. Since the violence started in 2009 ,_,  thousands of fighters have also been killed in clashes between security forces and Boko Haram members across different locations in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._. 
Since 2012 ,_,  thousands of people have died in military custody in Borno and Yobe states ._. 
Hundreds more have been victims of enforced disappearances and thousands have been subjected to acts of torture and other forms of cruel ,_,  inhuman and degrading treatment in military and police custody in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._. Amnesty International is calling on regional and international human rights bodies to step up in ensuring that thorough ,_,  independent ,_,  impartial and transparent investigations are conducted ._. 
Nigeria should seek international assistance and advice in the conduct of these investigations and any subsequent prosecutions ._. Recent Attacks and Unlawful Killings by Boko HaramSince the beginning of 2014 ,_,  attacks by suspected Boko Haram members have intensified ,_,  resulting in the deaths of more than 700 people ,_,  mainly civilians not directly participating in hostilities ._. 
Boko Haram has embarked on a campaign of widespread violence and human rights abuses ,_,  resulting in a general atmosphere of intimidation and fear among the population in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._. 
They have claimed responsibility for the majority of attacks in the north -_: east ._. 
As far as Amnesty International is able to ascertain ,_,  no other group or individuals have claimed responsibility for the attacks ._. 
However ,_,  it is possible that other groups or individuals have also carried out some of these attacks ._. On 3 March suspected Boko Haram members attacked Jakana Village in the Konduga Local Government Area of Borno State ._. 
They killed between 40 and 48 civilians ,_,  and destroyed shops and the police station ._.   ._. On 25 February ,_,  suspected Boko Haram members attacked a college in Yobe State ,_,  killing between 43 and 59 students and teachers ._. 
Several survivors and local residents told Amnesty International that the gunmen spent four hours in the school compound killing people and burning nearby houses and school buildings ._. 
They described how gunmen arrived around 9 :_: 00pm and started shooting indiscriminately ,_,  killing every male they found ._. 
Children who hid in a classroom were burned alive ._. 
Survivors and some eye witnesses told Amnesty International it took several hours before the army responded ._. In an interview with Amnesty International ,_,  one of the staff at the school said :_:  When the gunmen entered the school compound ,_,  there was confusion ._. 
Everybody was running for safety ._. 
I and many students ran into the bush ._. 
Many of the children did not return after the attack ._. 
We don't know what has happened to them ._. 
When I returned ,_,  my quarters had already been burned ._. 
As we speak ,_,  I'm staying with a relative ._. 
I don't know what to do ._. 
I am fed up ._. On Tuesday 11 February ,_,  suspected Boko Haram members killed more than 50 people and burnt scores of homes in the village of Konduga ,_,  also in Borno state ._. 
Two eyewitnesses in Konduga village told Amnesty International that between 30 to 40 girls were abducted and taken away by the gunmen during the attack on a government -_: run secondary school in the village ._. 
The Chief Nursing Officer of the General Hospital in Konduga was also reportedly kidnapped by the gunmen ._. Similar attacks have taken place in villages in Adamawa and Yobe states ,_,  leaving scores dead ,_,  injured and forcibly displaced ._. Nigeria's Security Forces Commit Human Rights Violations with ImpunityNigeria's security forces continue to commit serious human rights violations in their response to Boko Haram ._. 
Since 2009 ,_,  thousands of people suspected of having links to Boko Haram have been extrajudicially executed or unlawfully killed by the Nigerian army and police ._. 
Hundreds more have been victims of enforced disappearances and since 2012 ,_,  thousands of suspects died in military and police custody ._. The JTF frequently conducts raids usually following attacks by Boko Haram in which ordinary people are arrested en masse and detained in military detention centres for lengthy periods ,_,  often without charge or trial and without access to their families and lawyers ._. In 2014 ,_,  as attacks by Boko Haram intensified ,_,  the military has responded by stepping up its operations against Boko Haram camps in Borno state ._. 
In the first three months of the year ,_,  over 400 suspected Boko Haram members were killed in JTF raids and in firefights during Boko Haram attacks on towns ._. 
38 civilians have also allegedly been killed by the military this year ._. 
In addition ,_,  at least 150 detainees died in military custody ._. Hundreds Unlawfully Killed by the Nigerian Security Forces on 14 March 2014On Friday 14 March ,_,  at 7 am Boko Haram members attacked the Giwa barracks in Maiduguri ,_,  Borno state and opened the cells to release the more than 1 ,_, 000 detainees ,_,  who were arrested under suspicion of being members or sympathisers of Boko Haram ._. 
A video released by Boko Haram shows gunmen entering the Giwa military barracks ,_,  setting ablaze scores of vehicles in the compound ,_,  before releasing hundreds of people ,_,  including women ,_,  children ._. 
Many of those released looked frail and were barefooted ._. Eyewitnesses told Amnesty International that the attackers came from a nearby village and crossed the Yedzaram River ._. One resident in Mairi ,_,  Mallam Ibrahim1 described what he saw during the attack :_:  On Friday morning around 7 to 7 :_: 30 in the morning ,_,  I heard gunshots ._. 
I came out to the back of my house and saw gunmen running towards the barracks ._. 
I live close to the barracks ._. 
We were all scared ._. 
We knew the day is going to be very bad for all of us ._. 
We stayed indoors with my family ._. 
The gunshots continued non -_: stop ._. 
It took about an hour before we heard the fighter jet ._. A few minutes later ,_,  we saw lots of people coming towards our house from the barracks ._. 
Many of them look hungry ,_,  barefooted and were asking for water ._. 
Some did not even have full clothes on ._. 
We came out and started helping them ._. 
We gave them water and some fruits ._. 
We later took them to a classroom in the University of Maiduguri ._. 
They were 56 in total ._. 
They told us they are all detainees from Giwa ,_,  added Ibrahim ._. Mallam Ibrahim and one other resident in Mairi told Amnesty International that ,_,  less than an hour after the detainees left the barracks ,_,  two Hilux trucks filled with government soldiers came to the scene where the 56 former detainees were gathered ._. 
Mallam Ibrahim said :_:  The soldiers asked all of us to leave the area ._. 
The former detainees were all in the classroom ._. 
They started screaming 'we are not Boko Haram ._. 
We are detainees !_. ' I and my other neighbours saw the soldiers take the former detainees to a nearby place called 'no man's land ,_, ' behind the University of Maiduguri ._. 
We stood there and watched while the soldiers opened fire and killed the 56 people we had just given fruits and water ._. 
They were shot and killed in front of us ._. 
All of them ._. 
Just like that ._.  report continues with more details of killings by the security forces in the wake of the attack  ._. According to reports received from eyewitnesses ,_,  family members ,_,  lawyers and community activists ,_,  at least 622 people were killed by the security forces on 14 March ._. 
The actual number could even be higher ._. Humanitarian Crisis and Impact of the Conflict on Civilian PopulationThe ongoing fighting between Boko Haram and the Nigerian security forces has had damaging impact on the lives of millions of people across north -_: east Nigeria ._. 
The humanitarian situation in the region has reached unprecedented levels ._. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries and thousands more have been made internally displaced ._. 
According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees UNHCR  ._.  the crisis in north -_: eastern Nigeria ,_,  exacerbated by the declaration of the state of emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States on 14 May 2013 extended for six months on 12 November 2013 ,_,  more than 520 ,_, 000 people ,_,  mainly women ,_,  children and elderly people have been forced to flee inside Nigeria or seek refuge in neighbouring countries Niger ,_,  Cameroon and Chad ._. On Tuesday 26 March 2014 ,_,  the Director -_: General of the Nigerian National Emergency Management Agency NEMA said more than 250 ,_, 000 people have been displaced as a result of the fighting in northeastern Nigeria ._. Nigerian Government's Failures to Address ImpunityAmnesty International has repeatedly urged the authorities to conduct thorough and independent investigations into the alleged human rights violations and abuses with a view to bringing suspected perpetrators to justice in a fair trial ._. Over the years ,_,  both State and Federal government have established inquiries into acts of violence including communal and sectarian violence in Nigeria's middlebelt ,_,  unlawful killings ,_,  poor conditions in detentions and other instances of violations and abuses ,_,  but their findings and recommendations have mostly not been made public ._. 
Criminal investigations have been inadequate ,_,  with serious doubts over the quality of evidence against those arrested ._. In 2013 ,_,  the committee set up by President Goodluck Jonathan to investigate and explore options for bringing an end to the on -_: going fighting in northern Nigeria submitted its report to the Presidency ._. 
The findings of the Committee's report have not been made public ._. Following previous incidents of political ,_,  communal and sectarian violence ,_,  scores of people were rounded up by the police and security forces but few have been successfully prosecuted ._. According to information received by Amnesty International ,_,  previous commissions of inquiry into allegations of human rights abuses have named suspected perpetrators ,_,  yet very few people are aware of the content of these reports ._. 
In many cases ,_,  no criminal investigation is initiated on suspected perpetrators ._. 
Victims of violence have not received redress or reparation ,_,  including compensation ,_,  leaving people destitute and further stoking feelings of resentment and desperation ._. 
Victims and their families have a right to know the truth about the abuse of their rights including the identities of individuals or groups responsible for carrying out or ordering violations ._. As such ,_,  Amnesty International is urging the international community ,_,  in collaboration with credible national civil society organisations and the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria ,_,  to set up an independent and international commission of enquiry with a mandate to investigate grave human rights abuses and violations that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in north -_: eastern Nigeria ._.

Yet ,_,  the government's response is largely military ,_,  and political will to do more than that appears entirely lacking ._. Most Nigerians are poorer today than they were at independence in 1960 ,_,  victims of the resource curse and rampant ,_,  entrenched corruption ._.

In many parts of the country ,_,  the government is unable to provide security ,_,  good roads ,_,  water ,_,  health ,_,  reliable power and education ._. 
The situation is particularly dire in the far north ._. 
Frustration and alienation drive many to join self -_: help ethnic ,_,  religious ,_,  community or civic groups ,_,  some of which are hostile to the state ._. 
It is in this environment that the group called Boko Haram usually translated loosely as Western education is forbidden by outsiders emerged ._. 
It is an Islamic sect that believes corrupt ,_,  false Muslims control northern Nigeria ._. 
The group and fellow travellers want to remedy this by establishing an Islamic state in the north with strict adherence to Sharia Islamic law ._. Boko Haram's early leader ,_,  the charismatic preacher Mohammed Yusuf ,_,  tried to do so non -_: violently ._.   ._. Yusuf subsequently became increasingly critical of the government and official corruption ,_,  his popularity soared ,_,  and the group expanded into other states ,_,  including Bauchi ,_,  Yobe and Kano ._.   ._. A series of clashes between Boko Haram members and police escalated into an armed insurrection in 2009 ._. 
Troops crushed the rebellion ,_,  killing hundreds of followers and destroying the group's principal mosque ._. 
Yusuf was captured ,_,  handed over to the police and shortly thereafter extrajudicially executed ._. Boko Haram went underground and a year later launched attacks on police officers ,_,  police stations and military barracks ,_,  explicitly in revenge for the killings of Yusuf and his comrades ._. 
Its spokesman demanded prosecution of those responsible ,_,  release of their detained colleagues ,_,  restoration of the mosque and compensation for sect members killed by troops ._. 
Since 2010 ,_,  the group's campaign has grown ,_,  targeting not only security forces ,_,  government officials and politicians ,_,  but also Christians ,_,  critical Muslim clerics ,_,  traditional leaders ,_,  the UN presence ,_,  bars and schools ._.

In May 2013 ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan declared an emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa states and deployed additional troops that with the help of vigilantes drove Boko Haram from most cities and towns ._.

Borno State Governor ,_,  Alhaji Kashim Shettima ,_,  Monday described as unfair ,_,  unhealthy and dangerous to the continued unity and well being of the nation to link the military to the deadly Boko Haram sect ._. The governor said to argue or claim that some elements in the military hierarchy were supporting Boko Haram will only add to undermine every Nigerian that supposedly should be in arms against the insurgents ._. Shettima ,_,  who was apparently reacting to series of recent media reports quoting an unknown soldier that top military leaders were working in tandem with Boko Haram elements ,_,  in a statement to the press said :_:  Of all theories being alleged in connection with the Boko Haram ,_,  the most dangerous as far as I am concerned is to raise such grievous suspicion around our security forces ._.

Details to follow
The Governor of Borno State ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  on Monday described the recent media reports linking the military with Boko Haram as unfair ,_,  most unhealthy and unhelpful in counter insurgency operations ._. Mr ._. 
Shettima ,_,  in a message issued to journalists through his media aide ,_,  Isa Gusau ,_,  said such reports were capable of endangering the survival of Nigeria as a nation ._. A voice credited to an unknown Nigeria soldier was heard on the Hausa Service broadcast of the Voice of America claiming that top military leaders were working in tandem with Boko Haram ._. The unidentified soldier also alleged that a serving soldier of the Nigeria Army was amongst those killed on the side of the Boko Haram during the recent attack on Bama Town ,_,  Borno State ._. Mr ._. 
Shettima in his statement said ,_,  Of all conspiracy theories being alleged of the Boko Haram ,_,  the most dangerous ,_,  as far as I'm concerned ,_,  is to raise such grievous suspicion around our security forces ._. 
When citizens grow such suspicion and believe in it ,_,  I'm afraid ,_,  Boko Haram can light fireworks to celebrate a grand victory of setting up citizens against the security agencies ._. Since last week ,_,  I have listened and read these media reports with the hope that the issue will not be getting out of hand but it appears the matter is growing and I find it very disturbing ._. 
I do not want to bother about the credibility or otherwise of the soldier in question ._. 
I'm sure the security forces take this allegation seriously and they are investigating it as they should ._. He noted that he was not speaking for the Army but that as the Governor of the worst -_: hit state in the on -_: going conflict and one who has been working closely with security agencies ,_,  he wanted to encourage confidence building between citizens and the armed forces; So that intelligence sharing can rise continually and we don't lose focus in the counter insurgency ,_,  he said ._. He said that Nigerians should recognise that faced with the insurgency ,_,  the security agencies are all the country has ._. We should preserve their integrity by at least giving them the benefit of doubt ._. 
As the one working with them in Borno since 2011 ,_,  I know the number of military men ,_,  police men and women as well as para -_: military men and women ,_,  among them commanders in the military and senior police officers ,_,  who sacrificed their lives in the fight against our unfortunate insurgency problems in Borno ,_,  which also obtains in some parts of Nigeria ._. 
Insurgents will do everything to cause confusion ,_,  to manipulate us so that we don't trust each other as citizens and as establishments ._. 
Let's not fall into their trap ,_,  lose focus and become their mass victims ,_,  he said ._. He disclosed that the in the past ,_,  the military had arrested ,_,  made public ,_,  and court -_: martialed soldiers found to be collaborating with insurgents ._. Such patriotic efforts by the military establishments should be intensified by all security agencies ,_,  he said ._. He also acknowledged the important role played by the media in the fight against the insurgents ._. The media should kindly ,_,  and very importantly too ,_,  help in fighting any suspicion that can grows between citizens and armed forces ._. 
The armed forces rely on information from citizens ,_,  the citizens rely on the armed forces for protection ,_,  this therefore means that suspicion between them will help no one but insurgents who would take advantage of such situation at the end to wreck more havoc on already traumatised citizens ._. Let us continue to pray and work for peace using whatever platforms at our disposals so that we can happily live ,_,  freely worship ,_,  associate and move around all parts of Nigeria as we should in our fundamental rights ,_,  Mr ._. 
Shettima said ._. 
The Nigerian Human Rights NHRC Commission in Abuja Monday afternoon indicted the Nigerian Army ,_,  the Directorate of State Security ,_,  DSS and the Attorney General of the Federation saying they had no credible evidence to tag the 8 youngsters killed last September as agents of Boko Haram terror group ._. In an 83 -_: page final report and decision ,_,  NHRC said ,_,  last September 20 ,_,  an army -_: DSS detachment stormed an uncompleted building in the Apo/Gudu district of the Federal Capital Territory for a presumed operation to flush out a Boko Haram sleeper cell ._. The security forces claimed at the time that over 100 inmates of Boko Haram fighters led by one Suleiman were hiding and coordinating an attack on Abuja from the building ,_,  and had buried arms at the nearby Gudu cemetery ._. After a 30 minutes military operation at the building ,_,  7 of the inmates were killed ,_,  one later died in the hospital ,_,  while 4 were arrested and later detained ._. 
Some of the inmates escaped during the operation while some of the arrested inmates were expelled and asked never to return to Abuja ._. In its report ,_,  the NHRC said it investigated the contending claims and based its resolutions on two questions :_:  whether security forces applied proportionate force to the alleged threat and whether those killed were lawfully denied their lives ._. The NHRC slammed the security agencies for their argument that the victims were Boko Haram combatants ._. 
It said there is no credible evidence to reach such a conclusion and for that reason ,_,  the victims remain in the face of the law ,_,  protected civilians under the Geneva Convention act that governs the rule of law ._. The NHRC also rebuked the security forces for being trigger happy ,_,  saying their testimonies of self -_: defence were inconsistent and could not be accepted ._. Security forces acted without proper amount of case in the prevention of death ,_,  said the NHRC ,_,  describing the killings as unlawful violations of right to life of the deceased ._. Still on the question of proportionality of force ,_,  the NHRC said not only did security agents violate the right to life of the victims ,_,  even the survivors suffered non -_: lethal violations of right to life ,_,  physical integrity and livelihood ._. The Army ,_,  DSS and the Attorney General's office were asked to pay N10 million to each of the deceased family and N 5million to the 11 injured youth ._. Regarding the order to banish some of the youth from Abuja ,_,  the NHRC said the security forces had no legal backing to exclude or internally banish citizens ._. The NHRC gave two months to the three agencies to review and harmonise rules of engagement governing the operations of security agencies and bring them into compliance with international standards governing armed conflict ._. 
THERE is the direct killing ,_,  like the one happening in the Boko Haram -_: ravaged states ._. 
Some human beings have to be eliminated for the country to move forward ._. 
So ,_,  for anyone Boko Haram gunned down ,_,  it is one less of the bad guys in our society; such people are not fit to co -_: habit with decent individuals ._. There is also the indirect killing; this can assume various forms; usually ,_,  it involves third parties ._. 
It is happening everyday in our society ,_,  through money driven individuals in corporate organisations who believe more in the turnover of the business ,_,  than in the welfare of the workers ._. Perhaps ,_,  the greatest killer under the indirect category is the government ._. 
People are dying daily by the actions and in actions of the government and the civil servants initiating these killer policies ._. It is a known fact that every policy of government automatically makes millionaires of some people  -_:  usually ,_,  a very negligible percentage  -_:  while it results in the impoverishment and death of many others ._. 
Incidentally ,_,  the people we have placed there to see to the welfare of our common patrimony ,_,  seem to be oblivious of the consequences of their actions ._. In those days ,_,  the civil service was not an attraction for the brightest amongst fresh applicants from the universities and other tertiary institutions ,_,  usually the private sectors  -_:  banks ,_,  oil companies ,_,  blue chips et al  -_:  are preferred ._. 
Now days ,_,  a job in government civil service or parastatal is more preferred ._. 
This is because ,_,  the job is secure ,_,  no matter what happens; the salary is guaranteed and paid  -_:  courtesy of NLC  -_:  and they do not have to be target driven to remain on their jobs ._. 
Moreover ,_,  their salaries are now being subsidised by so many unearned incomes  -_:  ten percent ,_,  bribes ,_,  outright stealing  -_:  who will challenge themAnd so ,_,  these ones ,_,  who are government agents ,_,  sit in their offices and begin to churn out decrees ,_,  laws and policies that are stifling to the ordinary man out there struggling to make ends meet ._. 
They swoop on offices and harass genuine business concerns struggling to make ends meet ._. 
If the people are unable to accede to their demands ,_,  the business premises are put under locks and keys until they pay ,_,  albeit through their noses ._. 
It is extortion at the highest level ._. 
It is happening at the federal level ,_,  it is happening in Lagos and virtually ,_,  all of the states in the federation ._. 
In the name of multiple taxes and levies ,_,  honest business concerns are being run out of business ._. 
Usually ,_,  the greater percentage of amount paid goes into their individual pockets ,_,  while a paltry amount is paid into the government coffer to fulfil all righteousness ._. 
Rumour has it that 80% of the landed properties in Abuja belong to civil servants ,_,  politicians and other government agents ._. 
We all know what the true take home remuneration is for an average civil servant ._. 
If you calculate all of the amount he will earn throughout his working life ,_,  it cannot fetch him a bungalow at the heart of Abuja; but ,_,  here we are ,_,  with civil servants owning duplexes ,_,  not one or two but multiples ._. Our government contractors are crying ,_,  the civil servants register phony businesses and award the contracts to themselves; whether it is executed or not ,_,  payment is made ,_,  as long as there are papers to cover up the transactions ._. 
The only set of people happy in this country are the politicians ,_,  civil servants and workers of other Federal Government agencies ._. That is why they sit down and pass out policies that are not favourable to the ordinary Nigerian ._. 
Meanwhile ,_,  they will be the ones shouting ' Patriotism' and behind ,_,  they carry out sabotage ._. 
For example :_:  why is it impossible for our Customs to put a halt to rice smugglingOur officials in the agric ,_,  trade and investments ,_,  and the finance ministries ,_,  came up with a policy to encourage local rice production ._. 
This is patriotic and encouraging  -_:  one might say  -_:  but if you consider the fact that this policy has encouraged smuggling of over four million metric tonnes of rice from neighbouring countries in one year alone ,_,  you will ,_,  like me ,_,  be having a different opinion ._. 
This policy has increased smuggling across the borders ,_,  more than a hundred fold ,_,  while our local production is threatened ._. 
Smugglers are smiling to the bank ,_,  the government in Cotonou is happy ,_,  while genuine ,_,  patriotic men and women in the Nigerian rice business are being run aground ._. What kind of government will institute policies that will favour other countries to the detriment of its own citizens ._. 
The people of Benin Republic do not consume parboiled rice ,_,  so all the rice imported into Cotonou are destined for Nigeria ._. 
Rice import through the land border is supposed to be banned ,_,  but now it comes in droves like traffic along the Lagos -_: Ibadan expressway ._. What is the solution The government should be engaged in guided or phased import substitution programmes ._. 
As long as what we produce locally cannot take care of the Nigerian market ,_,  there will be room for smuggling ._. 
To eliminate smuggling therefore ,_,  the duty should be at par with what obtains in our neighbouring countries ._. 
Presently the difference is too wide  -_:  Nigeria 110%; Benin 35% ,_,  now reduced to 5 -_: 15%  ._. 
There is no way our importers can bring in goods and make profit as the current tariff stands ._. Government must enter into a partnership with all the Nigerian stakeholders to make the local rice production a reality and not through fiat ._. 
I was in a gathering of rice distributors and they voted to continue patronising smuggled rice because our importers are not bringing rice in ._. Our policies must encourage our local players  -_:  importers ._. 
The same should be extended to the tokunboh vehicles and and fish import policies ._. It is wrong policies that caused the immigration interview deaths ._. The happiness of the people is the responsibility of the government ,_,  our policy formulators must help us ._. Sunny Ikhioya a commentator on national issues ,_,  wrote from Lagos ._. 
Borno State governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  yesterday frowned at recent media reports linking officers of the Nigeria Army with sponsorship of Boko Haram activities ,_,  even as he said such claims are capable of endangering the survival of Nigeria as a nation ._. The governor said he could always vouch for the conduct of the officers and men that had been helping his state and other parts of the northeast in battling the insurgents ._. Such allegation is unfair ,_,  most unhealthy and unhelpful in counter insurgency operations ,_,  he said ._. The VOA Hausa Service had over the weekend aired a voice credited to an unknown Nigerian soldier who claimed that he had copious evidence that top military officers and soldiers are secretly helping the Boko Haram to perpetrate attacks ._. In a statement he personally signed and made available to journalist through his media aide ,_,  Isa Umar Gusau ,_,  Shettima argued that of all conspiracy theories being alleged of the Boko Haram ,_,  the most dangerous as far as I'm concerned is to raise such grievous suspicion around our security forces ._. When citizens grow such suspicion and believe it ,_,  I'm afraid ,_,  Boko Haram can light fireworks to celebrate a grand victory of setting up citizens against the security agencies ._. Since last week ,_,  I have listened and read these media reports with the hope that the issue will not be getting out of hand ,_,  but it appears the matter is growing and I find it very disturbing ._. 
I do not want to bother about the credibility or otherwise of the soldier in question ._. 
I'm sure the security forces take this allegation seriously and they are investigating it as they should ._. I am not holding brief for the armed forces but as governor of Borno State ,_,  whose area is unfortunately the worst hit ,_,  who has been closely working with security agencies ,_,  I would rather encourage confidence building between citizens and the armed forces so that intelligence sharing can rise continually and we don't loose focus in the counter insurgency ._. The day citizens grow the suspicion of regarding security agencies as collaborators of insurgents whereas the security have the constitutional mandate of protecting citizens ,_,  then we will be drifting towards chaos as a Nation ,_,  we cannot afford that unhealthy development ._. 
Unless it becomes unquestionably evident ,_,  we must work as individuals ,_, groups and institutions to promote public trust in our armed forces so as to encourage cordiality between citizens and security agencies ._. We must recognise that at the moment ,_,  the security agencies are all we've got ,_, we should preserve their integrity by at least giving them the benefit of doubt ._. 
As the one working with them in Borno since 2011 ,_,  I know the number of military men ,_,  police men and women as well as para -_: military men and women ,_,  among them commanders in the military and senior police officers that sacrificed their lives in the fight against our unfortunate insurgency problems in Borno which also obtains in some parts of Nigeria ._. 
Insurgents will do everything to cause confusion ,_, to manipulate us so that we don't trust each other as citizens and as establishments ,_, let's not fall into their trap ,_, loose focus and become their mass victims ._. The military has in the past arrested ,_,  made public and court -_: marshalled soldiers found to be collaborating with insurgents ,_, such patriotic efforts by the military establishments should be intensified by all security agencies ._. I must acknowledge and very well appreciate the important roles played by the media in the fight against insurgency ._. 
The media should kindly and very importantly ,_, too ,_,  help in fighting any suspicion that can grow between citizens and armed forces ._. 
The armed forces rely on information from citizens ,_, the citizens rely on the armed forces for protection ,_,  this therefore means ,_, that suspicion between them will help no one but insurgents who would take advantage of such situation at the end to wreck more havoc on already traumatised citizens ._. 
Let us continue to pray and work for peace using whatever platforms at our disposals so that we can happily live ,_,  freely worship ,_,  associate and move around all parts of Nigeria as we should in our fundamental rights ._. 
The National Human Rights Commission NHRC has indicted the Nigerian Army and the Department of State Services DSS for their role in the killing of eight people in the Apo District of the Federal Capital Territory on September 20 ,_,  2013 ._. The commission ,_,  through its Chairman ,_,  Professor Chidi Odinkalu ,_,  said the Army and the DSS failed to prove that the eight persons killed and 11 others injured due to an attack launched by the security operatives in Apo ,_,  in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja ,_,  were members of Boko Haram ._. In the report read by Odinkalu for about two hours ,_,  the commission said there was no credible evidence to suggest or show that the victims were members of Jama'atu ahlus sunnah lid da'awati wal jihad also known as Boko Haram ,_,  JALISWAJ or involved in direct participation in hostilities ._. On that basis ,_,  Odinkalu said that they were protected ,_,  civilian non -_: combatants ._. The DSS had on September 18 ,_,  2013 ,_,  allegedly received intelligence report that there was a planned attack on unspecified areas in Abuja ._. Following the intelligence report ,_,  the DSS arrested three persons ,_,  who ,_,  under interrogation ,_,  disclosed that they had a leader in Abuja called Suleiman also known as R'Kelly as the arrowhead of the planned terror attacks under the auspices of the Jama'atu ahlus sunnah lid da'awati wal jihad JALISWAJ also known as Boko Haram and that they could identify and lead the security services to him ._. One of the detainees also confessed that the group had weapons four AK -_: 47 rifles that were buried in the cemetery in Apo ._. This had prompted security operation which was conducted by the DSS with the assistance of the Nigerian Army on September 20 ._. Shortly after midnight ,_,  the security agents allegedly arrived at the cemetery in Gudu to commence digging with two of their informants but were unable to recover any weapons ._. 
The informants then led the agents to an uncompleted residential building where their alleged leader ,_,  Suleiman R'Kelly ,_,  resided ._. 
The security agents were allegedly met with fire ,_,  which they returned ._. 
The shooting lasted over 30 minutes ._. Seven men had died during the operation from gunshot -_: related wounds; another died in hospital for bullet injuries ,_,  and 11 other men were hospitalized for injuries received during the encounter ._. A few days after the killings ,_,  Global Rights ,_,  a non -_: governmental organisation working for the advancement of human rights in Nigeria ,_,  filed petition to the commission challenging the legality of the deaths in Apo ._. On September 21 ,_,  another NGO ,_,  the Human Rights Law Service HURI -_: LAWS ,_,  filed a separate complaint with the commission alleging that the killings referred to in the DSS release were unlawful and that the persons killed were innocent squatters unconnected with the JALISWAJ ._. After hearing from parties in the case ,_,  the commission in its findings said ,_,  The defence of self -_: defence asserted by the respondents is not supported by the facts or evidence ._. Taking account of all the circumstances in this case ,_,  the application of lethal force was disproportionate and the killings of the eight deceased persons as well as the injuries to the 11 survivors were unlawful ._. There is no basis in law for confining detainees freed by the respondents to internal banishment ._. The commission however ordered the awards of the sum of N10million as compensation for each of the deceased or N80 million in respect of the eight deceased persons ._. It also awards to each of the injured survivors the sum of N5 million or a total of N55 million against the respondents ._. The commission ordered the attorney -_: general of the federation and minister of justice to ensure that evidence of payment is lodged with the registry of the National Human Rights Commission within 30 days of the present decision ._. It further restrained the DSS and the Nigerian Army from the use of administrative banishment against any of the survivors ._. Furthermore ,_,  it ordered that all the respondents shall undertake a review and harmonisation of the Rules of Engagement governing the operations of security agencies to bring them into compliance with the applicable rules of international humanitarian law governing non -_: international armed conflicts ._. It further requires that the respondents shall file a certified text of the harmonized and updated Rules of Engagement with the secretariat of the National Human Rights Commission within two months of the present decision ._. The commission stated that in accordance with section 221 of the National Human Rights Commission Act as amended ,_,  it shall register this report and decision for enforcement with the Federal High Court in the Federal Capital Territory ._. But the Senate had in November last year said the killing of eight people and wounding of 11 others in an uncompleted building in Apo ,_,  Abuja ,_,  by security agents was not a case of extra -_: judicial killing ,_,  but the outcome of a hastily executed operation ._. Again ,_,  it confirmed the existence of a Boko Haram cell in Abuja planning to carry out terrorist activities in the area ._. Unmask Fulani killers ,_,  Jonathan tasks security operativesPresident Goodluck Jonathan has ordered the security agencies to unmask those behind the recent killing of Fulani herdsmen in the northern part of the country to know if it has political undertone or not ._. Fulani rustlers struck in Zamfara on Sunday killing some 200 people in different communities in Maru and Zurmi local government areas ._. Since late last year ,_,  some Fulani herdsmen have been reportedly going about some communities killing innocent people in some states in the north :_:  Benue ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  Nassarawa ,_,  Plateau ,_,  and Zamfara ._. Suspected Fulani herdsmen sack 17 villages In NasarawaSuspected Fulani herdsmen on Monday besieged 17 villages in Agaza district of Keana local government area ,_,  barely five days after scores of suspected insurgents were killed by soldiers in an operation in the area ,_,  reducing them to rubble ._. LEADERSHIP gathered from reliable sources that the suspected attackers ,_,  armed with sophisticated weapons ,_,  were said to have invaded the villages inhabited mostly by Tiv farmers in Agaza district situated on the outskirts of Keana town ._. Villages which came under the siege of the suspected Fulani attackers include Iwar ,_,  Ugbagyer ,_,  Tse -_: Abebe ,_,  Ayeraga Ormtswen ,_,  Nenpua Gidan -_: Aondovihi ,_,  Tse -_: Ankyuwa ,_,  all within Agaza district ._. 
No life was however lost in the incident as the inhabitants had deserted the areas ._. When contacted ,_,  the police public relations officer of the Nasarawa State command ,_,  ASP Ismaila Nuhu ,_,  confirmed the incident but said investigation into the incident was still ongoing ._. Northern governors decry killings ,_,  call for prayersThe Northern States Governors' Forum NSGF on Monday called on Nigerians ,_,  especially those living in the north ,_,  not to despair over the persistence of attacks on innocent citizens in the region ._. Chairman of the Forum and governor of Niger State Dr Mu'azu Babangida Aliyu urged well -_: meaning Nigerians to continue to pray to God to end the scourge of senseless killing of defenceless citizens ._. Governor Aliyu made the call in his reaction to the attack on some communities in Zamfara State which reportedly killed about 200 people at the weekend ._. Governor Aliyu's reaction was contained in a statement by his spokesman ,_,  Danladi Ndayebo ._. Killings grand agenda to destabilize Muslim Ummah  -_:  -_:  JNIThe Jamatul Nasri Islam JNI ,_,  national headquarters ,_,  has attributed the killings of mostly Muslims as a grand agenda to destabilize the Muslim Ummah in the country ._. A press statement signed by the secretary -_: general ,_,  JNI ,_,  Dr Khalid Abubakar Aliyu ,_,  and made available to LEADERSHIP in Kaduna said :_:  We can say without any fear of contradiction that there is a grand agenda to destabilize the Muslim Ummah in Nigeria ._. 
If any Nigerian is in doubt regarding the hidden grand agenda to destabilize Muslims in Nigeria ,_,  and cautiously reduce their rising human capital ,_,  then the Zamfara State incident should have removed this doubt ._. Zamfara attacks :_:  IGP deploys massive special forcesAs part of wider strategies aimed at tackling the recurrent attacks on some Zamfara communities ,_,  the inspector -_: general of police ,_,  MD Abubakar ,_,  has ordered the immediate massive deployment of special forces comprising 10 units of police mobile force PMF ,_,  three units of conventional policemen ,_,  a unit of counter -_: terrorism personnel ,_,  border patrol teams and force intelligence personnel drawn from various squadrons and commands to reinforce the operation of the existing force in the affected areas ._. 
In addition ,_,  the air wing of the Nigeria Police will commence aerial patrol and surveillance in order to efficiently and effectively monitor the situation ._. 
Political foot soldiers of President Goodluck Jonathan and leaders of the newly registered All Progressive Congress APC yesterday took the 2015 political battle to Washington ,_,  DC ,_,  USA ._. Centre for Strategic and International Studies CSIS and PSN ,_,  the organizers of an event entitled :_:  'The Second Session of Nigeria Election Forum ,_, ' said that the discussion was important as it would highlight the critical roles and responsibilities of Nigeria's political leaders ,_,  candidates and party supporters in laying the foundations for peaceful and credible elections in 2015 ._. The Peoples Democratic Party PDP delegation which included Dr ._.  Doyin Okupe ,_,  a senior special assistant for Public Affairs to President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  Delta State governor Emmanuel Uduaghan and other party supporters promised that the PDP -_: led administration in Nigeria would ensure that all the elections in 2015 are conducted according to the rules ._. They further said that the government was doing everything to ensure that there is no post -_: elections violence in 2015 ,_,  like the ones that erupted shortly after the announcement of the last general elections in 2011 ._. The PDP delegation however asked Nigerians and the international community to disregard recent claims by chieftains of the opposition party ,_,  APC ,_,  where they said that the fifteen years of PDP government in Nigeria was a waste ,_,  pointing that the Transformation Agenda of Mr ._. 
President had brought several positive changes to the country ._. They also asked the opposition to desist from the act of blaming everything that happens in the country on President Jonathan and his administration ._. On insecurity ,_,  President Jonathan's men promised that the federal government would do everything at its disposal to tackle insurgency and killings of innocent souls before the commencement of the 2015 general elections ._. They accused some enemies of the PDP -_: led administration of promoting Boko Haram members in order to cause crisis in the country during the elections ,_,  but he added that the security agencies in the country were now better equipped to foil the plan ._. In a counter reaction ,_,  the delegation of the APC which had the party's national publicity secretary ,_,  Alhaji Lai Mohammed ,_,  Senator Babafemi Ojudu from Ekiti State ,_,  Zamfara State governor ,_,  Ahlaji Abdul'aziz Yari ,_,  and others ,_,  said that the opposition party would work with Nigeria's security agencies to ensure that credible elections are conducted in the country in 2015 ._. Criticizing the threats by the PDP to recapture the South West and some other strongholds of the APC ,_,  the delegation said that the opposition party would diplomatically and peacefully resist every attempts to manipulate the 2015 general elections by the ruling party ._. They insisted that the ruling PDP had nothing to show as its major achievements since it had been ruling the country in 1999 ,_,  and claimed that the Nigeria's electorate would begin to experience positive changes that would be effected by the APC -_: led government in 2015 ._. The delegation noted that record had been set straight as a result of the immeasurable achievements that had been recorded in all the APC -_: controlled states all over the federation ._. The APC members however said that Professor Attahiru Jega's leadership of the INEC doesn't have what it takes to conduct credible elections in 2015 ,_,  stressing that the general elections would determine the existence of the country ._. They alleged that Jega who could not conduct a credible governorship election in just Anambra state should not be fully entrusted with the supervision of the 2015 general elections ._. Furthermore ,_,  they said that the APC would not assassinate anybody's character during its campaigns but noted that the party's campaigns would be based on its immeasurable achievements in all its strongholds and the achievements would help the party to dislodge the ruling PDP in 2015 ._. According to Mr ._. 
Lai Mohammed ,_,  the APC's National Publicity Secretary :_:  2015 elections is not all about one party replacing the other ._. 
It will be whether the country will continue to stay as one single country ._. 
This is why we in APC must be able to make the ultimate sacrifice to rescue Nigeria ._. 
APC will dislodged the PDP because we will not only field candidates for all elective offices in the 2015 elections but we will win the majority of seats in the elections at all levelsa
Washington � The Presidency and opposition parties led by the All Progressives Congress ,_,  yesterday ,_,  took their battle for the 2015 elections to far away Washington D ._. C ._.  ,_,  in the United States of America ._. A forum on Nigeria's preparations for the 2015 elections ,_,  degenerated to a war of words ,_,  after opposition leaders in the country pointed at alleged failings of President Goodluck Jonathan in governance and his sincerity towards free and fair elections ._. The forum held under the auspices of the Washington -_: based Centre for Strategic and International Studies ,_,  CSIS nearly boiled over after Dr ._.  Doyin Okupe who led the presidency and Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  delegation warned opposition politicians not to bring the personality of the president into the forum ._. Dr ._.  Okupe who had started by claiming that he would not wash the country's dirty linen in public ,_,  however ,_,  expploded when Alhaji Lai Mohammed ,_,  the All Progressives Congress ,_,  APC ,_,  spokesman hinted at the administration's failure to address transparency issues including the alleged missing $20 billion oil revenue and indiscretions by the Independent National Electoral Commission ,_,  INEC as failings of the government ._. Alhaji Lai Mohammed should not cast aspersions on the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria because if he does that ,_,  he knows me and what I can do ,_,  Okupe said as he went on to project the 2011 elections as the best in the country's history which he said ,_,  were only dented by violence inspired by opposition politicians ._. Nigeria's ambassador to the United States ,_,  Prof ._.  Ade Adefuye in his summary of the discussions ,_,  however ,_,  praised the two sides saying that the articulation of the two parties was reflective of the high level of political discourse in Nigeria ._. 
He nevertheless warned the two sides not to wash the country's image in public even as he raised questions about Nigerians coming to discuss their country in the United States ._. Okupe had a Senior Special Assistant to the President ,_,  Sanya Awosan and Fred Majemite ,_,  Political Adviser to the Governor of Delta State on the panel ._. 
Besides Mohammed ,_,  the APC was represented by Senator Babafemi Ojodu ,_,  APC ,_,  Ekiti Central ._. 
The event was attended by Nigerian professionals ,_,  American specialists on Africa and state department officials among others ._. 
Among others present at the event were Dr ._.  Usman Bugaje ,_,  former senior aide to the vice -_: president in the Olusegun Obasanjo administration; Mr ._. 
Oma Djebah ,_,  senior adviser to the governor of Delta State on foreign relations ._. The PDP National Chairman ,_,  Alhaji Adamu Mu'azu was excused on the basis of a caucus meeting in Abuja and Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State was similarly excused following the killing of more than 100 persons in the state ,_,  last weekend ._. Noting the APC's preparations for the 2015 election ,_,  Mohammed pointed at ongoing congresses to choose party officials and the roll out of a road map to lead Nigeria out of the malaise of unemployment ,_,  insecurity among other issues bothering on lack of transparency in the management of the economy and the electoral process ._. Okupe responding ,_,  immediately faulted Mohammed as he said that he did not come to discuss the president's performance ,_,  noting that he had reservations about discussing our internal problems abroad ,_,  and warned Mohammed ,_,  who he had earlier embraced before the commencement of the discussions not to comment on the personality of the president ._. Ms Jenniefer Cooke ,_,  Director of the CSIS Africa programme who moderated the discussions from that point intervened as both sides tried to showcase the failings of one another ._. 
Senator Ojudu was specifically cited the unwillingness of the PDP majority in the legislature to project good bills to consolidate democracy and faulted President Jonathan's refusal to give assent to the State of the Nation address ._. Faulting Okupe's assertion that the problems of Nigeria should be internalised ,_,  Ojudu said :_:  We cannot be an island of our own ._. Okupe from time to time teased the APC team on what he called the lack of internal democracy ,_,  saying that the party was quick to suppress the mandate of parties who won in the last local government elections in Lagos State ._. Ms Cooke was forced to intervene after Okupe raised issues on Mohammed's assertion of the administration's failures to address the spate of insecurity inspired by the Boko Haram Islamic group ._. Noting words of advice from the party to the government ,_,  he said :_: Insurgency is not a matter that can be politicised but unfortunately the government of the day has not been able to distinguish between the message and the messenger ,_,  as the opposition politicians faulted the president's failure to visit the war ravaged sections of the Northeast ._. Okupe intervening hollered ,_,  I do not expect you to come to this forum to raise these issues ,_,  it is nonsense ,_,  he said ._. The CSIS forum continued last night with sessions between the Nigerian politicians and state department officials ._. Sessions would also be held today with other democracy building institutions based in America and meetings with senior officials of the Barack Obama administration ._. 2015 elections would be better than 2011  -_:  -_: JonathanMeanwhile ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan has said that he would ensure that no other Nigerian leader suffers international humiliation which the late president ,_,  Umaru Yaradua and himself suffered ,_,  saying that as long as he remains the president ,_,  he would ensure the conduct of a credible and acceptable election in 2015 ._. He spoke ,_,  yesterday  ,_,  when he received the outcome of the National Stakeholders Forum on Electoral Reform from former Senate President ,_,  Ken Nnamani ,_,  the Chairman of Ken Nnamani Centre for Leadership and Development ._. According to President Jonathan ,_,  there is a lot of noise in the air but definitely the elections will be better because we must put our legs down and make sure that the right things are done ._. While commending the Ken Nnamani foundation for its 'painstaking commitment' to examining relevant department of government to strengthen the electoral process ,_,  the president assured that he would do everything to ensure that there was credibility in the conduct of election ,_,  promising that the 2015 election would be better conducted and more credible than those of 2011 ._. Anything about elections ,_,  I'm totally committed ._. 
And I used my personal experience when I came on board in 2007 as a vice president ,_,  and I promised myself that if I have the privilege to oversee elections in Nigeria ,_,  we will do better ._. 
Bayelsa State is totally a PDP State and I didn't see how anybody could win election outside the PDP ._. 
I had to go to my ward to vote ,_,  because everything about politics is local ,_,  but at the end of that election I was embarrassed when the international observers complained that there were certain breaches ._. Even though after taking oath of office and the Supreme Court declared us winners ,_,  each time one travelled abroad ,_,  people ask all kinds of questions that even gets one angry ._. 
That was when I promised myself that if I have an opportunity to oversee elections in Nigeria ,_,  no other president or vice president should suffer that kind of harassment by the international community ._. That was why the 2011 elections ,_,  even though I was candidate ,_,  I said nobody should manipulate elections for me that my ambition and the fate of the country are two different things ._. 
The interest of the nation is much more superior than any other ambition and I kept faith with that ._. 
At least ,_,  at the end of that election ,_,  it was accepted by observers locally and internationally ._. 
And I promise that 2015 elections will be better ,_,  he said ._. On the recommendations by the Ken Nnamani Foundation which include the establishment of electoral offences commission ,_,  funding of INEC and support for constitutional/electoral reform ,_,  the President noted that they were in tandem with government's thinking and policy ._. On the establishment of electoral offences commission ,_,  the president agreed that there must be a dedicated body so that people who commit electoral offences will not get away with it ._. After elections ,_,  the matter goes to the tribunal ,_,  the only person who loses ,_,  is the person who contested that election ._. 
Other people who committed all kinds of atrocities get away with them and nobody punishes them ._. 
And that is why we continue to have that kind of impunity ._. 
That was why my committee at a time recommended this election offences commission ,_,  where we stated that whether elections are annulled or not ,_,  there must be process of bringing those who have done one thing or the other contrary to expectations to book ._. 
Lafia � The police in Nasarawa State yesterday raided a brothel in the Angwan Jaba area of Lafia and arrested 44 persons ._. 
It was not clear what the operation led by the Area Commander in charge of Lafia ,_,  ACP Monday Bala was for ,_,  but witnesses suggested that those nabbed are Boko Haram suspects ._. 
Truckloads of armed policemen first stormed the area on Friday evening and arrested 23 persons at a soccer viewing centre near the brothel ,_,  but they freed all the suspects the next day ,_,  a witness said ._. Yesterday ,_,  the policemen returned to the area ,_,  this time ,_,  storming the brothel which is popularly known as Gidan Babajide ._. 
They did not arrest commercial sex workers ,_,  only men ,_,  some of them teenagers who were taken first to the Criminal Investigation Department CID along Jos Road ,_,  and later transferred to the Area Command headquarters in Ombi area of the state capital ._. Police spokesman ,_,  ASP Umaru Ismaila told Daily Trust that he could not confirm the arrest and the reason for the operation because he was just returning from an assignment in neighbouring Benue State ._. 
The Defense Headquarters yesterday denied claims by an anonymous soldier in an interview with the Voice of America VOA Hausa service alleging that three counter insurgency instructors were killed alongside Boko Haram members in the Sambisa Forest ._. The Director Defence Information ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade said ,_,  Listening to that interview and knowing the discipline of the Nigerian soldier ,_,  as well as the real situation on the ground ,_,  one cannot but have some strong doubts as to the genuineness of that episode ._. 
It is very ,_,  very unlikely that a normal soldier will make those remarks ._. He added that ,_,  The propagandists of the terrorists should not hide under the guise of not wanting to disclose the identity of their sources to present an impostor as a serving soldier just to make their fallacious messages look real ._. 
That liar is definitely not a serving soldier ._. 
You may recall that Aljazeera tried the same trick sometime last year ._. Nevertheless ,_,  the details are being studied for the purpose of sifting the wheat from the chaff in case any sense could be made out it all ,_,  General Olukolade said ._. 
Damaturu � Dozens of suspected members of the Boko Haram who rounded up and killed Muslim worshippers in a Yobe village mosque last Friday were on a revenge mission ,_,  Daily Trust learnt from residents yesterday ._. 
They said the terrorists who stormed Buni Gari in Gujba LGA threw explosives at worshippers who were observing Maghrib sunset prayers around 7pm ._. The residents said the invaders entered the village which is less than 100 kilometres from Damaturu ,_,  the state capital for the third time attacking Buni Yadi ,_,  a farming and business community worsening the already crippled social and economic life of the people ._. The worst part of our predicament is that ,_,  like what happened during previous attacks ,_,  there was no resistance from security operatives in the village ._. 
The soldiers and the policemen simply disappeared soon after the militants fired the first shot ,_,  a trader Abubakar Yadi ,_,  who escaped from the village said ._. He said the insurgents had earlier surrounded the village mosque and told the worshippers their mission ._. They Boko Haram were angry with us ._. 
They reminded us that we trailed three of their members sometime ago ._. killed one ,_,  handed over the second to soldiers and the third one narrowly escaped ._. 
They said it was an affront and disrespectful and therefore the whole village must pay a price ._. 
They threw explosives into the mosque which killed nearly 20 people ,_,  he said ._. Another villager ,_,  Mallam Mohammed ,_,  said some of the worshippers escaped the blast in the mosque but were shot with Ak47 rifles ._. We are yet to see some of our people ,_,  including women and children who fled into the bushes ,_,  Mohammed said ._. 
It was gathered that over 60 percent of the eastern part of Buni Gari was destroyed by the attackers who set most of the houses ablaze ._. 
Sources said over 200 brick ,_,  mud and thatched houses were destroyed ._. 
Over 40 vehicles were burnt at the motor park ._. 
They also destroyed shops ,_,  stalls and other property ._. They moved from one area to another and took their time to wreak havoc ,_,  Bala Baba ,_,  another local who moved his family to Damaturu yesterday said ._. The life of over 10 ,_,  000 people in Buni Gari is threatened ._. 
They vowed that they would force us into extinction for daring them ,_,  he said ._. 
He said military operatives only returned to the village after the attackers left ._. 
Police commissioner Sanusi A Rufa'I said 10 people died inside the mosques while 10 others were hospitalized but was not sure if any of those that sustained bullet wounds later died in their homes or hospital ._. 
The commissioner said that based on the on assessment conducted by the police ,_,  4 tricycles machines ,_,  over 100 houses and 40 cars were burnt ._. 
Calabar � The Senate leader ,_,  Senate Victor Ndoma -_: Egba has expressed the fear that the alleged introduction of chemical weapons by the insurgents in Benue State has become the biggest security threat to the nation ._. Calling for thorough investigation into the claims ,_,  the Senate leader said the allegation is a frightening dimension in Nigeria's security challenges ._. Speaking in Calabar when he was bestowed an award by the Post Graduate Students of the University of Calabar as the All Round Best Law Maker ,_,  he said the allegation should be taken seriously by the security agencies ._. The security agencies must get to the root of the allegation because this is a frightening dimension to the security challenges that we are having and take adequate measures to address the issues ._. He commended the various security measures by the federal government to stem the Boko Haram insurgency but emphasised that the JTF must intensify their campaign ._. 
Borno State Governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima today said that linking the Nigerian Armed Forces with the Boko Haram is not fair ,_,  most unhealthy and unhelpful in counter -_: insurgency operations and dangerous to the survival of the nation ._. Governor Shettima was reacting today to series of media reports which began since last week ,_,  quoting an unknown soldier that top military leaders were working in tandem with Boko Haram elements ._. BELOW IS THE MESSAGE OF THE GOVERNOR WHICH WAS ADDRESSED TO JOURNALISTS TODAY ._. Of all theories being alleged in connection with the Boko Haram ,_,  the most dangerous as far as I'm concerned is to raise such grievous suspicion around our security forces ._. 
When citizens grow such suspicion and believe in it ,_, I'm afraid ,_, Boko Haram can light fire works to celebrate a grand victory of setting up citizens against the security agencies ._. 
Since last week ,_,  I have listened and read these media reports with the hope that the issue will not be getting out of hand but it apears the matter is growing and I find it very disturbing ._. I do not want to bother about the credibility or otherwise of the soldier in question ._. 
I'm sure the security forces take this allegation seriously and they are investigating it as they should ._. 
I am not holding brief for the armed forces but as Governor of Borno State ,_, whose area is unfortunately the worst hit ,_,  who has been cloely working with security agencies ,_,  I would rather encourage confidence building between citizens and the armed forces so that intelligence sharing can rise continually and we don't loose focus in the counter insurgency ._. The day citizens grow the suspicion of regarding security agencies as collaborators of insurgents whereas the security have the constitutional mandate of protecting citizens ,_,  then we will be drifting towards chaos as a Nation ,_,  we cannot afford that unhealthy development ._. 
Unless it becomes unquestionably evident ,_,  we must work as individuals ,_, groups and institutions to promote public trust in our armed forces so as to encourage cordiality between citizens and security agencies ._. We must recognise that at the moment ,_,  the security agencies are all we've got ,_, we should preserve their integrity by at least giving them the benefit of doubt ._. 
As the one working with them in Borno since 2011 ,_, I know the number of military men ,_,  police men and women as well as para -_: military men and women ,_,  among them commanders in the military and senior police officers that sacrificed their lives in the fight against our unfortunate insurgency problems in Borno which also obtains in some parts of Nigeria ._. Insurgents will do everything to cause confusion ,_, to manipulate us so that we don't trust each other as citizens and as establishments ,_, let's not fall into their trap ,_, loose focus and become their mass victims ._. 
The military has in the past arrested ,_,  made public and court -_: marshalled soldiers found to be collaborating with insurgents ,_, such patriotic efforts by the military establishments should be intensified by all security agencies ._. I must acknowledge and very well appreciate the important roles played by the media in the fight against insurgency ._. 
The media should kindly and very importantly ,_, too ,_,  help in fighting any suspicion that can grow between citizens and armed forces ._. 
The armed forces rely on information from citizens ,_, the citizens rely on the armed forces for protection ,_,  this therefore means ,_, that suspicion between them will help no one but insurgents who would take advantage of such situation at the end to wreck more havoc on already traumatised citizens ._. 
Let us continue to pray and work for peace using whatever platforms at our disposals so that we can happily live ,_,  freely worship ,_,  associate and move around all parts of Nigeria as we should in our fundamental rightsShettima said in a message he personally signed and issued to journalists in Maiduguri ._. 
I JUST returned last week from a short visit to London ._. 
One of the major news -_: items there was the re -_: opening of an inquest into the Hillsborough disaster of 1989 when some spectators died during the F ._. A ._. 
Cup semi -_: final football -_: match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest ._. 
When I heard this ,_,  I shook my head ._. 
These oyinbos are still concerned about deaths that took place 25 years ago ._. 
But here in Nigeria ,_,  there is no serious inquest into the deaths of job -_: applicants to the Nigerian Immigration Service in several cities just this year ._. A Senate Committee spent a perfunctory two days paying lip -_: service to the disaster ._. 
The Minister of Interior ,_,  Abba Moro ,_,  refused to resign ._. 
His understanding of his responsibility did not go beyond mouthing vain platitudes ._. 
The government imposed no sanctions on those who turned our stadiums into death -_: traps simply in order to defraud the poor unemployed of 6 billion naira ._. 
A court -_: verdict ordered that 50 million naira compensation should be paid to the suspended Central Bank Governor for his unlawful detention for 24 hours ._. 
How much compensation should be paid for the senseless deaths of innocent job -_: seekersOfficial neglectThe government has passed legislation criminalising homosexuality in Nigeria without regard for the implication of this for fighting the scourge of HIV/AIDS ._. 
After South Africa ,_,  Nigeria has the highest number of HIV/AIDS patients in the world ._. 
Who cares if by criminalising homosexuality ,_,  homosexual patients are discouraged from seeking such medical treatment as are available locally Let them die; and if they don't ,_,  we can certainly stone them to death if we ever discover that they are homosexuals ._. The Boko Haram go to churches to kill Christians ._. 
Christians go to church prayer -_: meetings to kill their enemies ._. 
Atheists go to babalawos to negotiate death -_: sentences for their rivals ._. 
It is no longer a big deal to hear of Fulani herdsmen killing the innocent ,_,  or of area -_: boys executing jungle -_: justice in our streets ._. 
It is now all par for the course ._. Let us face it :_:  there is no regard for human -_: life in Nigeria ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  we love life ,_,  but promote and encourage death ._. 
We lavishly celebrate births ,_,  but disregard children after they are born ._. 
The Israelis would move heaven and earth to protect and defend the life of one Israeli ._. 
But governments in Nigeria don't give a damn whether a Nigerian lives or dies ._. 
Over three million Nigerians were slaughtered in a three -_: year civil war; and yet there is no national memorial commemorating our loss ._. 
The victims are gone ,_,  what else is newMurder incorporatedHow much is a human -_: being worth in Nigeria Not more than the cost of a hearty meal in a mama -_: put ._. 
If you want someone killed ,_,  you don't have to break the bank ._. 
You can get a contract -_: killer for as little as 1 ,_, 000 naira and the job will be done ._. 
The list of unresolved murders is so long ,_,  you begin to wonder what exactly the Nigerian police are doing ._. 
From Dele Giwa ,_,  to Alfred Rewane ,_,  to Anthony Ikhazoboh ,_,  to Bola Ige ,_,  to Harry Marshal ,_,  to Funso Willams; Nigerians continue to get slaughtered without any reprieve ._. If someone were to kill you today ,_,  the only people who may blink an eye are members of your family ._. 
Even they may be more concerned with sharing your property than with prosecuting your killers ._. 
As people come ostensibly to commiserate with your relatives about your death ,_,  so would they be asking if they can have your spanking stereo system ._. When I was living in a block of flats ,_,  our maiguard got drunk one night and was killed by a hit -_: and -_: run driver ._. 
His friends sent a delegation to the tenants ,_,  saying they needed money to send him home for burial ._. 
We contributed money and gave it to them ._. 
But as we watched from the window ,_,  they gathered round and shared the money among themselves ._. 
Who cares The man is dead ._. Medical deathsBy the law of averages ,_,  if you are a Nigerian the chances are high that you will be dead before your 40th birthday ._. 
It is amazing how many people kick the bucket after proverbially brief illnesses ._. 
We have hospitals where doctors can go on strike for months ,_,  while the government dilly -_: dallies ._. 
Indeed ,_,  hospitals are places where Nigerians go to die :_:  and not to be healed ._. 
If a relative of yours has to undergo surgery in Nigeria ,_,  it is time for fasting and prayer ._. You can even go to a hospital for vaccination against a disease and end up dead from that very disease because of an overdose of the vaccine ._. 
That is what killed my only sister ,_,  Yemisi ,_,  at the tender age of eighteen ._. 
It should be against the law in Nigeria for government officials to seek medical treatment abroad for any ailment whatsoever ._. 
Let them improve the medical facilities here at home or face the music with everyone else ._. We keep discovering new ways to send as many people as possible to early graves ._. 
We sell fake drugs ,_,  knowing they can either kill the sick or ensure that they die of neglected ailments ._. 
We live in unsanitary neighborhoods ,_,  where rubbish piles up high in the streets ,_,  not caring that this makes us prone to diseases ._. 
We pump oil out of the Niger Delta ,_,  without regard for the pollution of the environment ._. 
The oil companies know they can get away with murder in Nigeria ,_,  doing things in our country that would bankrupt them if they dared to do them at home ._. Wasted livesIn Nigeria ,_,  we produce children ,_,  without sparing a thought for how they would be cared for ._. 
You can have a messenger in an office ,_,  earning 18 ,_, 000 naira a month; nevertheless he is the father of 12 children ._. 
How does he expect to take care of them He does not !_. 
He expects them to take care of him ._. 
From an early age ,_,  he distributes some among his relatives ._. 
He sends out the leftovers as sellers of chewing -_: gum and groundnuts on the streets ._. 
They become street -_: urchins and beggars required to make daily returns to him ._. 
What does it matter if they grow up to be kidnappers and armed -_: robbersBecause human life is disregarded ,_,  a whole segment of our population still cannot read and write; and yet we are in the 21st century ._. 
Because we have no regard for life ,_,  our policemen are as equally likely to shoot you and kill you as they are to protect you ._. 
If you are more fortunate ,_,  they might arrest you merely for walking on the streets and lock you up somewhere for 10 years without trial ._. Let me ask you this :_:  how many men have you ever heard of going to jail for raping women in Nigeria It is not because Nigerians are not rapists like other people ,_,  but that in Nigeria rape is not that big a deal ._. 
Neither is marrying under -_: aged girls ._. 
That actually happens to be the preferred pastime of our distinguished Senators in the National Assembly ._. University lecturers go on a strike for six months ._. 
Nobody seems to care that this is six wasted months in the life of hapless students ._. 
In serious countries ,_,  such neglect might be enough to bring down a government ._. 
Not in Nigeria ._. 
We all know our university education is largely useless anyway ._. 
Most graduates in Nigeria cannot write a sentence of English correctly without firing bullets ._. 
What does it matter if they waste six months while lecturers and the government stare each other down Everyone knows when they graduate they will waste even more time looking for non -_: existent jobs ._. Nobody caresIn our cities ,_,  you can go to work in the morning and find a dead man lying on the street ._. 
When you come back in the evening ,_,  you are likely to find him still there ._. 
Nobody really cares ._. Nobody cares that ,_,  as a result of being the highest users of generators in the world ,_,  we are killing ourselves with the fumes ._. 
Nobody cares that our women are dying by the tens of thousands from ingesting the smoke from cooking with firewood all day long ._. 
Nobody cares that our orthopedic hospitals now have glorified okada wards ,_,  full of people maimed and crippled by naira -_: drunk motorcyclists ._. 
Nobody cares that our flea -_: markets and supermarkets sell expired foods and our so -_: called pure water is responsible for the high incidence of typhoid ._. When they discourage the smoking of cigarettes in the West because of medically -_: proven research that it causes a lorry -_: load of deadly diseases ,_,  the tobacco industry finds a high -_: growth market in Nigeria with every encouragement from our easily -_: bought legislators ._. 
Our mechanics put fake spare -_: parts in our cars ,_,  not caring a hoot if that makes us vulnerable to accidents ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  if you are not killed while driving on the road ,_,  you can be killed while walking on the sidewalk because the okada -_: rider or the Keke Marwa driver does not believe the sidewalk is reserved for pedestrians ._. Corruption deathsCan you imagine it if the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 had been a Nigerian plane full of Nigerians Would the Nigerian government be particularly bothered to spend money in search of the plane ,_,  after all ,_,  what are 239 missing Nigerians in a country of 170 million There are so many Nigerians ,_,  we are easily expendable ._. 
Even if the government were to budget funds to search for the missing plane ,_,  it would not be amiss for some officials to chop the money ._. In 1992 ,_,  a Nigerian Air Force C -_: 130 transport plane crashed in Ejigbo near Lagos ,_,  killing all 200 passengers including top military officers ._. 
A government -_: sponsored memorial service ,_,  coordinated by Vice -_: Admiral Babatunde Elegbede ,_,  was organised in Abuja ,_,  and the widows of the dead were specially invited ._. 
However ,_,  instead of spending the budgeted money on the widows ,_,  it was pocketed ._. 
Instead of housing them in hotels in Abuja ,_,  they were dumped en masse and made to spend the night in an airport hangar ._. 
While there ,_,  they cursed Admiral Elegbede with one voice and prayed that he should come to a bad end ._. In June 1994 ,_,  Admiral Elegbede was assassinated by unknown gunmen ._. 
Over 70 bullets were pumped into his body ._. 
His assailants have never been found ._. 
Abuja � The National Human Rights Commission ,_,  NHRC ,_,  yesterday ,_,  said its investigations revealed that eight persons that were killed by a joint team of the Nigerian Army and operatives of the Department of State Services ,_,  DSS ,_,  at an uncompleted building situated at the Apo District of the Federal Capital Territory on September 20 ,_,  2013 ,_,  were not members of the Boko Haram Islamic sect as was alleged by security agencies ._. In a report it released yesterday ,_,  the commission ,_,  which had earlier conducted a public hearing on the matter ,_,  said there was no shred of evidence to show that the deceased victims belonged to the dreaded Jama'atu ahlus sunnah lid da'awati wal jihad ,_,  also known as Boko Haram ._. CompensationConsequently ,_,  the commission ordered the Federal Government to pay N10 million compensation to each of the families of the eight deceased persons as well as pay N5 million to each of the 11 injured survivors ._. More so ,_,  the NHRC directed the AttorneyGeneral of the Federation and Minister of Justice ,_,  Mr ._. 
Mohammed Bello Adoke ,_,  to ensure that evidence of payment of the compensation was lodged with the registry of the commission within 30 days from yesterday ._. In an unanimous decision ,_,  the threeman probe panel which was headed by the chairman of the governing council of the NHRC ,_,  Professor Chidi Odinkalu ,_,  ordered the Federal Government to forthwith ,_,  undertake a review and harmonization the Rules of Engagement governing the operations of security agencies to bring them into compliance with the applicable rules of international humanitarian law governing noninternational armed conflicts ._. The panel directed that a certified text of the harmonized and updated Rules of Engagement should be filed at the secretariat of the NHRC within two months ,_,  saying it will in accordance with section 221 of the NHRC Act as amended ,_,  register the report and decision it took yesterday for enforcement with the Federal High Court in the Federal Capital Territory ._. Other members of the NHRC investigating panel that endorsed the report yesterday were the Executive Secretary of the commission ,_,  Mr ._. 
Bem Angwe and Mrs ._. 
Saudatu Mahdi ._. According to the panel ,_,  This final report and decision by the NHRC stems from an internal security operation carried out by internal security agencies in the Apo/Gudu District in the Federal Capital Territory FCT on September 20 ,_,  2013 that resulted in at least eight persons killed and 11 persons injured ._. While acknowledging the current security challenges confronting the nation ,_,  the commission emphasized that the primary responsibility of civil protection lies with the Nigeria Police Force ._. Army vows to challenge verdictMeanwhile ,_,  the Nigerian Army ,_,  yesterday ,_,  vowed to challenge the decision ,_,  insisting that there was also nothing to prove that the victims fell under the bullet of soldiersSpeaking to newsmen shortly after the report was issued yesterday ,_,  Director of Legal Services of the Nigerian Army ,_,  Colonel Yusuf Ibrahim ,_,  maintained that unless forensic examination was carried out ,_,  the army would not admit culpability for the September 20 ,_,  2013 midnight massacre ._. It will be recalled that the NHRC commenced investigation into the matter sequel to two separate petitions that were forwarded to it by two nongovernmental organisations working for the advancement of human rights in Nigeria ,_,  Global Rights and the Human Rights Law Service ,_,  HURILAWS ._. Subsequently ,_,  the National Association of Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association ,_,  NATOMORAS ,_,  which claimed that most of the victims were its members ,_,  equally joined as complainants in the matter ,_,  even as they demanded a public apology from the government for branding the victims terrorists and the payment of N500 million as compensation families of the deceased persons ._. The Commander ,_,  Brigade of Guards Nigeria Army ,_,  Major Gen ._. 
Emmanuel Atewe had on December 23 ,_,  2013 ,_,  told the panel that the Apo incident was part of ongoing military operation to rid the FCT of Boko Haram elements ,_,  as well as ,_,  ensure peace and stability in the country ._. He noted that the military acted on the basis of a report from the DSS which he said indicated plot by members of the sect to launch attacks in Abuja ._. 
Abuja � WITH clear unanimity ,_,  delegates ,_,  yesterday ,_,  decried the increasing rate of insecurity and corruption in the country ,_,  noting that unless these two problems were adequately tackled ,_,  the country's search for peace might remain elusive ._. Almost all the delegates who spoke at the first session of the resumed debate on President Goodluck Jonathan's inaugural speech toed this line of thought and appealed to the Federal Government and security agencies to put mechanism in place to arrest the situation ._. The delegates' emphasis on security in particular ,_,  came following the latest killings of people in Zamfara State coupled with last Thursday's abduction of the son of Elder statesman and one of the delegates to the conference ,_,  Chief Edwin Clark ._. Shortly after resumption of plenary ,_,  Dr Bello Haliru Mohammed ,_,  from Kebbi State ,_,  raised a motion calling the attention of delegates to the abduction of Chief Clark's son and the weekend's killings of people in Zamfara by suspected Fulani herdsmen ._. Bello ,_,  a former chairman of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  who is at the conference under the platform of elder statesmen ,_,  called on the conference to send an emissary to felicitate with Chief Clark over the ugly incident ._. Security agenciesThe former Defence Minister ,_,  while moving the motion began :_:  We were seated here last week when we heard that the son of Chief Edwin Clark ,_,  one of our own elder statesmen in this conference ,_,  was kidnapped ._. 
Fortunately during the weekend ,_,  we received the news that Egbekeme Clark has been released safe and sound ._. 
It was good news to us all ,_,  but I will like to move that this house sends a message of felicitation to Chief Edwin Clark ._. He said :_:  These kidnappers are not spirits ._. 
Boko Haram are not spirits ._. 
They live with us ._. 
I am happy that the son of Chief Clark has been released without paying a dime ._. 
I use this opportunity to say that the FG should do more on security ._. 
We should address it more than we are doing ._. 
Our lives at are not safe ._. 
I want to appeal to government at all levels and security agencies to do something urgent and drastic to address this loss of lives which has become persistent in this country ._. While seconding the motion ,_,  Senator Adefemi Kila ,_,  representing the Nigerian Society of Engineers ,_,  said ,_,  The security matter is very serious and germane in this country ,_,  and decried what he referred to as government's current approach to arresting insecurity in the country ._. After listening to both delegates ,_,  the conference chairman ,_,  Justice Idris Kutigi rtd subjected the motion to a voice vote and it was unanimously supported ._. Following this ,_,  Justice Kutigi ,_,  then directed that a letter of felicitation be written to Chief Clark over his son's release ._. But his directive was challenged by some delegates who requested the conference to also send a letter of commiseration to the government and people of Zamfara State ._. 
But he ruled them out of order ._. Jonathan should be courageous to implement report  -_: JumariAs the debate continued ,_,  Prof ._.  Mohammed Jumari an elder statesman from Sokoto ,_,  urged the president to be courageous to implement the outcome of the report that will be submitted ._. He also suggested that a committee of judges should visit prisons and review the cases of inmates that have been unlawfully detained ._. We need LG autonomy  -_: JunjuOn his part ,_,  Barrister Ibrahim Junju ,_,  a delegate representing the Federal Government ,_,  thanked the president for his speech ,_,  saying the President placed responsibility on us and we must not fail the people ._. He called for autonomy for local governments ,_,  noting that Nigeria's problems were becoming worse because according to him ,_,  local governments were not working ._. Speaking also ,_,  Chairman ,_,  Trade Union Congress ,_,  TUC ,_,  Comrade Bala Kaigama ,_,  who suggested that trade unions and civil societies be placed on exclusive list ,_,  aligned with the president's speech but noted that the president omitted that we should apologise to youths below the age of 18 because of our injustice to them ._. We should apologise to Nigerians below voting age because of our misdeeds ._. 
We have over 80 million youths in this country and our misdeeds have placed this country in the situation we are today ,_,  he said ._. We must see Nigeria as ours  -_: KawuA newspaper columnist ,_,  Ishaq Modibo Kawu ,_,  in his submission ,_,  tasked Nigerians to see the country as theirs just as he regretted that those who found themselves in public arena have transferred public assets into private hands ._. Most crises we have in Nigeria today are as a result of the people of 60 and above years wanting to impose their colonial mentality on the people ._. 
There are governors who have ruled Nigeria and are now richer than the country ._. Governors have ruined LGs  -_: KhalilIbrahim Khalil ,_,  National President of Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees ,_,  NULGE ,_,  and a delegate representing organized labour ,_,  called for strengthening of local government areas in the country just as he regretted that state governors have rendered the councils impotent ._. Akinyemi breaks rules ,_,  says I'm inexperiencedYesterday's plenary session ended on a jocular note with the Deputy Chairman of the Conference ,_,  Professor Bolaji Akinyemi ,_,  who moderated the last lap of the proceedings forgetting to observe protocols and rules of the house ._. This came after two Points of Order by Madam Ankio Briggs ,_,  a Federal Government delegate and Senator Adolphus Wabara ,_,  an Abia State delegate were separately taken ._. Briggs had raised the order to call the attention of the conference to empty seats in the audience ._. 
She submitted that it was against the rules for delegates to desert their seats without prior notice to the leadership ._. On his part ,_,  Wabara told the conference that it would be wise to send a delegation of the conference to Bauchi State to commiserate with the family of late Mamman Misau ,_,  a delegate ,_,  who died one week into the four weeks old conference ._. Conscious of the closing time ,_,  tAkinyemi ,_,  who upheld the points of order announced that the time left to adjourn plenary for the day could only accommodate one speaker ._. 
He then proceeded to call on the former governor of Oyo State ,_,  Rasheed Lodoja whose turn it was to speak ._. 
It was already 6pm when Ladoja rounded off his speech ._. 
Borno State Governor ,_,  Alhaji Kashim Shettima ,_,  Monday said for the continued unity and wellbeing of the country ,_,  it was unfair and dangerous to link the military to the outlawed Boko Haram sect ._. Shettima ,_,  who was reacting to series of recent media reports quoting an unknown soldier as saying that some top military leaders were working in tandem with Boko Haram elements ,_,  said such claim would only further undermine every Nigerian that supposedly should be in arms against the insurgents ._. The Governor in a statement made available to journalists ,_,  said :_:  Of all theories being alleged in connection with the Boko Haram ,_,  the most dangerous as far as I am concerned is to raise such grievous suspicion around our security forces ._. He said :_:  When citizens grow such suspicion and believe in it ,_,  I am afraid ,_,  Boko Haram can light fire works to celebrate a grand victory of setting up citizens against the security agencies ._. He lamented :_:  Since last week ,_,  I have listened and read these media reports with the hope that the issue will not be getting out of hand but it appears the matter is growing and I find it very disturbing ._.

Shettima said :_:  As the one working with them in Borno since 2011 ,_,  I know the number of military men ,_,  police men and women as well as para -_: military men and women ,_,  among them commanders in the military and senior police officers that sacrificed their lives in the fight against our unfortunate insurgency problems in Borno ,_,  which also obtains in some parts of Nigeria ._. He argued :_:  Insurgents will do everything to cause confusion ,_,  to manipulate us so that we do not trust each other as citizens and as establishments ,_, urging all not to fall into their trap ,_,  loose focus and become their mass victims ._. He said :_:  The military has in the past arrested ,_,  made public and court -_: marshaled soldiers found to be collaborating with insurgents ,_,  such patriotic efforts by the military establishments should be intensified by all security agencies ._. 
The governor added :_:  I must acknowledge and very well appreciate the important roles played by the media in the fight against insurgency ._. 
The media should kindly and very importantly too ,_,  help in fighting any suspicion that can grow between citizens and armed forces ,_,  insisting that :_:  The armed forces rely on information from citizens ,_,  the citizens rely on the armed forces for protection ,_,  this therefore means ,_,  that suspicion between them will help no one but insurgents who would take advantage of such situation at the end to wreck more havoc on already traumatized citizens ._. He said :_:  Let us continue Caption; Minister of Interior ,_,  Mr ._. 
Abba Moro Falana Gives Interior Minister Seven Days to Refund Applicants' N700m Tobi Soniyi Lagos lawyer ,_,  Mr ._. 
Femi Falana SAN ,_,  has written to the Minister of Interior ,_,  Mr ._. 
Abba Moro ,_,  asking him to refund the N700 million collected from job seekers who applied for employment in the Nigerian Immigration Service NIS ._. Falana gave the minister seven days to make the refund or face a lawsuit ._. 
The letter read :_:  We have confirmed that you extorted the sum of N700 million from hapless Nigerians who recently applied for employment in the Ministry of Interior ._. As there was no plan to employ the majority of the applicants ,_,  the said sum of N700 million was obtained by your good self under false pretense ._. In spite of your official negligence which led to the tragic death of 20 of the applicants ,_,  you stated that the federal government had not ordered you to refund the said sum of N700 million ._. 
You have therefore decided not to refund the money or forfeit it to the federal government ._. The lawyer said since the National Assembly did not pass any money bill authorising the collection of the recruitment fee or levy of N1000 per applicant ,_,  the minister's action was a violation of Section 59 1 b of the 1999 Constitution as amended which provides that there shall be a bill for the imposition of or increase in any tax ,_,  duty or fee or any reduction ,_,  withdrawal or cancellation thereof ._. 
He advised the minister to study the judgments delivered by two judges of the Federal High Court in Lagos last week ,_,  where it declared illegal and unconstitutional ,_,  the collection of toll by the Lagos State Government on the Lekki -_: Ikoyi link bridge and the collection of levy through the change of plate numbers by the Federal Road Safety Commission FRSC as both policies were not backed by any law enacted by the National Assembly ._. In view of the imposition of the recruitment fee or levy without any appropriation by the National Assembly  ,_, we are compelled to request you to refund the said sum of N700 million to the applicants including the bereaved families of those who lost their lives within seven days of the receipt of this letter ,_,  he added ._. He said should the minister fail to accede to the request ,_,  he would not hesitate to initiate legal proceedings against him for extorting N700 million from the job seekers on behalf of the federal government which ought to have secured employment for them ._. 
It is hoped that you will not compel us to resort to litigation in the circumstance as it will expose the federal government to untold embarrassment ,_,  he added ._. 
The National Human Rights Commission NHRC Monday declared that the killing of eight tricycle riders at the Apo Legislative Quarters in Abuja on September 20 ,_,  2013 by security agents was unlawful ._. In an 83 -_: page report read for about two hours by the Chairman of the Governing Council of the commission ,_,  Dr ._.  Chidi Odinkalu ,_,  the commission awarded N135 million as compensation to the relatives of those killed ._. The commission awarded N10 million to each of the family of the eight people killed during the attack and N5million to each the eleven that sustained injuries ._. The commission also directed that the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation must lodge the evidence of payment with the commission's office within 30 days ._. It said contrary to reports that the people killed were members of Boko Haram ,_,  the security agents did not even interview those wounded in the operation to establish their connection or otherwise to the sect ._. The commission said before the operation ,_,  security agents should have interrogated the owners of the property where the squatters were killed ._. The commission also said no arms and ammunition were shown to have been recovered from the property where the squatters were killed ._. It also stated that the claim by security agents that the squatters were the first to open fire was not believable in the circumstance ._. The commission urged the military and the Department of State Security DSS to undertake a review and harmonisation the Rules of Engagement governing the operations of security agencies to bring them into compliance with the applicable rules of international humanitarian law governing non -_: international armed conflicts ._. It also requested that the security agents to file a certified text of the harmonised and updated Rules of Engagement with the commission within two months ._. The report said :_:  Having investigated this complaint ,_,  heard all the parties and examined the relevant laws ,_,  the NHRC ,_,  exercising its powers under Sections 5 and 6 of the NHRC Act ,_,  2010 as amended ,_,  hereby determines and declares that :_: At the time of the lethal encounter giving rise to this complaint on or about September 20 ,_,  2013 ,_,  there was a non -_: international armed conflict NIAC going on in North -_: eastern Nigeria involving the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on the one hand and an organised armed group ,_,  Jama'atu ahlus sunnah lid da'awati wal jihad also known as Boko Haram ,_,  on the other ._. 
The theatre of active conflict extended to Abuja ,_,  the Federal Capital Territory FCT ._. With reference to the existence of a NIAC in Nigeria ,_,  the rules of international humanitarian law ,_,  including ,_,  in particular ,_,  common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions ,_,  are applicable to the parties to the conflict ._. 
The rules of human rights law under the Nigerian constitution and other relevant laws supplement international humanitarian law in the theatres of conflict and remain applicable outside those theatres ._. There is no credible evidence to suggest or show that the victims in this case were members of the Jama'atu ahlus sunnah lid da'awati wal jihad JALISWAJ also known as Boko Haram or involved in direct participation in hostilities ._. 
They were ,_,  therefore ,_,  protected ,_,  civilian non -_: combatants ._. The defence of self -_: defence asserted by the Respondents is not supported by the facts or evidence ._. 
Taking account of all the circumstances in this case ,_,  the application of lethal force was disproportionate and the killings of the eight deceased persons as well as the injuries to the eleven survivors were unlawful; andThere is no basis in law for confining detainees freed by the respondents to internal banishment ._. 
In consequence ,_,  the commission hereby orders and directs as follows :_:  Awards the sum of N10 million as compensation for each of the deceased or N8 million in respect of the eight deceased persons;Awards to each of the injured survivors ,_,  the sum of N5 million or a total of N55 million against the respondents ._. The council further noted that the ban of motorcycle and tricycle by the authorities of the FCT was not supported by any law and was therefore illegal ._. 
It said that it amounted to discrimination on the part of the poor who survive by riding bicycle and tricycles to eke out a living ._. 
The Nigerian Army said it would likely challenge the report on the grounds that it was not established that the shots that killed the victims were from its men ._. 
Mr ._. 
G ._. O ._. 
Amyalemechi who said this after the presentation of the report ,_,  said a decision would be taken after the authority had been briefed ._. 
Global Rights ,_,  a non governmental organisation NGO working for the advancement of human rights in Nigeria had initiated the complaint with the commission on the 20 September 2013 challenging the legality of the deaths in Apo ._. Similarly ,_,  on 21 September ,_,  another NGO ,_,  the Human Rights Law Service HURI -_: LAWS ,_,  lodged a separate complaint with the commission alleging that the killings referred to in the DSS release of 20 September were unlawful and that the persons killed were innocent squatters un -_: connected with the JALISWAJ ._. to pray and work for peace using whatever platforms at our disposal ,_,  so that we can happily live ,_,  freely worship ,_,  associate and move around all parts of Nigeria as we should in our fundamental rights ._. 
For the second time ,_,  the ruling All Progressives Congress ,_,  APC ,_,  in Borno State has shifted its ward congress date ,_,  even as the party's unity in the state is being threatened by the simmering war of supremacy between Governor Kashim Shettima and his erstwhile political godfather ,_,  Modu Sheriff ._. The congress has been scheduled for Tuesday ._. Leader of the partyOn Sunday ,_,  the chairman of the Borno State Congress Committee ,_,  Faruq Aliyu ,_,  explained ,_,  at a pre -_: congress meeting of party stakeholders in Maiduguri ,_,  that the delay and subsequent shift of the wards congresses had to do with the late arrival of the material needed to execute the exercise ._. The material needed for the congresses just came into Maiduguri on Saturday ,_,  and by our constitution requirement for elections ,_,  candidates vying for any party position must pay for their nomination forms through designated bank accounts before they are issued the forms ._. Since the materials for the elections only arrived on Saturday ,_,  we have to wait till Monday for the banks to open before we begin issuing the forms ._. 
All contestants for various positions would be allowed to pay for their forms on Monday ._. 
Accreditation would be concluded in the evening and election would take place on Tuesday in places where consensus could not be reached ,_,  he announced ._. Mr ._. 
Shettima ,_,  who was repeatedly hailed as the leader of the party during the meeting ,_,  emphasised in a brief speech that despite public perception he had no grudge against former Borno State governor ,_,  Mr ._. 
Sheriff ._. Power comes from God and nobody can say he or she has the ability to give power ._. 
I and former Governor Sheriff are not better than any one of you here ._. 
Anybody can aspire for any office and attain it if God so pleases ._. 
I am a child from a humble background ,_,  just like Senator Ali Sheriff was ._. 
Senator Sheriff's father and my father were ward councillors in 1976 when Elder Shettima Ali Monguno was the chairman of the Maiduguri Metropolitan Council ._. 
My father was the councillor for Lamisula ,_,  while his father was the councillor for Ngala ._. 
No matter where they are operating from ,_,  a councillor is a councillor ._. 
So we just have to humble ourselves and know that this power comes from God !_. 
Let it be on record that I have no grudge against Senator Sheriff ,_,  he remains our boss and our leader in Borno State ,_,  Mr ._. 
Shettima said ._. Though Mr ._. 
Shettima's speech was greeted with applause ,_,  it still did not go down well with some of the party members who insisted that Mr ._. 
Shettima was the leader of the party and not his predecessor ._. All is not wellA very senior political office holder in the state government who spoke to PREMIUM TIMES said ,_,  There is no need for pretence that all is not well between Governor Shettima and former governor Sheriff ._. The politician who spoke under anonymity as he was not cleared to speak officially explained that the former governor had pushed the incumbent to the wall ._. 
The politician added that Mr ._. 
Shettima had no option but to do what he is doing now ._. There is no way Governor Shettima would continue to be loyal and taking all the insults and embarrassment being heaped on him by Senator Sheriff ,_,  simply because he was the one that assisted him to become governor ._. 
Fine ,_,  Sheriff played a greater role in the political life of Shettima ,_,  but that does not mean he should be subjected to a figure head ,_,  that somebody elsewhere would be dictating to him on how to run his government ._. 
A governor is a governor ,_,  no matter how lowly or inconsequential one tries to look at him ,_,  the politician said ._. The source went further to explain how a once happy relationship went sour ,_,  when Mr ._. 
Sheriff wanted Mr ._. 
Shettima to dissolve his cabinet and sack a few commissioners who the former governor did not like ._. Governor Shettima had always told Senator Sheriff that he would do everything to obey him ,_,  but he cannot be dictated to on the issue of managing his cabinet ._. 
How can he be ordering him to dissolve the cabinet as if he is just some lackey that was installed to do his bidding His Excellency ,_,  Governor Shettima ,_,  had taken his time to explain to him that it would be wrong to sack these commissioners who had not even enjoyed their office because of the on -_: going Boko Haram conflict ._. 
He pleaded that they should be left to tarry for some time ,_,  till when it would be considered okay to fire them ._. 
The governor stood his ground ,_,  and Senator Sheriff was not happy about it; that was the beginning of their conflict ,_,  said the top politician ._. Meanwhile ,_,  Mr ._. 
Sheriff ,_,  who was expected at the pre -_: congress meeting on Sunday but failed to show up ,_,  later arrived Maiduguri via his private jet at about 8 :_: 30 p ._. m ._. 
He arrived alongside Kashim Imam ,_,  another top leader of the APC in the state ._. Messrs Sheriff and Imam were the key players that orchestrated the victory of Mr ._. 
Shettima and his deputy ,_,  Zannah Mustapha ,_,  in the 2011 election ._. Weeks to the 2011 general election ,_,  Mr ._. 
Imam ,_,  a top chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  and two -_: time governorship candidate of the party in the state ,_,  staged a massive pull out of his supporters from the PDP in protest of what he described as skewed governorship primaries in favour of flag bearer ,_,  Muhammed Goni ._. Mr ._. 
Imam ,_,  who had been a major financier of the party since 2003 ,_,  felt undermined by the action of his party men ._. 
He then moved to the All Nigeria Peoples Party ,_,  ANPP ,_,  where the ever -_: willing Mr ._. 
Sheriff ,_,  then an outgoing governor ,_,  struck a horse -_: trade that led to Mr ._. 
Imam's two -_: time running mate on the PDP ticket ,_,  Mr ._. 
Umar now the deputy governor to pair with Governor Shettima ._. PREMIUM TIMES gathered that Mr ._. 
Imam who has been silent on the political happenings in the state could play a key role in seeing that Messrs Sheriff and Shettima come to a common ground and save the party from an imminent implosion ._. Though those in Mr ._. 
Shettima's camp have boasted of having the majority of the support from the elected stakeholders ,_,  who are going to be automatic delegates in the forthcoming primaries after the ward congresses ,_,  some quarters still fear that should Messrs Shettima and Sheriff fail to find a common ground ,_,  it might lead to the two godfathers ganging up against the governor ._. We hope for an amicable settlement amongst them ,_,  but if they fail to settle ,_,  we should know that the battle will turn out dirtier ,_,  and many on both sides would come out with bloody noses ,_,  said a serving commissioner who pleaded anonymity for fear of being victimised ._. No settlementHowever ,_,  some others within the APC have also ruled out any form of settlement ._. 
It is believed that Mohammed Imam ,_,  a former state chairman of ANPP ,_,  who also served as commissioner in various capacity under Mr ._. 
Sheriff may not yield to dropping his ambition of becoming the next governor of Borno State ._. Mohammed's campaign posters have flooded the nooks and cranny of Maiduguri indicating that he is gunning for the governorship ._. 
He is believed to have the support of Mr Sheriff and was part of Mr ._. 
Sheriff's delegation that came into Maiduguri on Sunday night ._. Also ,_,  those in Governor Shettima's camp would prefer the governor parts ways with Mr ._. 
Sheriff if the latter does not discourage Mohammed from eyeing the governor's seat ._. 
They believe that as an incumbent ,_,  Mr ._. 
Shettima has majority of the support within the party and across the state ._. We have the 26 members of the House of Assembly on the side of His Excellency ,_,  Governor Shettima ._. 
We have eight out of the 11 members of the National Assembly on our side ._. 
We have the local government chairmen too ._. 
Sheriff only has three National Assembly members ,_,  said one of the loyalists of Mr ._. 
Shettima ._. But those speaking for Mr ._. 
Sheriff feel they are capable of rocking the boat and even denying Mr ._. 
Shettima a chance at the 2015 elections ._. Senator Sheriff ruled for eight years and had served three times as senator before the 2003 election that brought him in as a governor ._. 
It will be childish to think that in just three years you could uproot him from the system ,_,  given his larger than life political carriage ,_,  said the source speaking for Mr Sheriff ._. The Sheriff loyalist also said ,_,  Reconciliation might turn out to be very difficult because Governor Shettima had drawn the battle line when he sacked the state commissioner for Information ,_,  Mr ._. 
Inuwa Bwala and two other Senior Special Assistants ,_,  simply because they had sympathy for former Governor Sheriff ._. 
What other direct affront could be worse than that actionThe atmosphere in Maiduguri ,_,  as at the time of filing this report ,_,  was tense as hundreds of supporters either flocked to the home of Mr ._. 
Sheriff or were seen around the Government House ,_,  holding different meetings ,_,  as party members prepare for the ward congresses on Tuesday ._. 
The Nigerian Human Rights NHRC Commission in Abuja Monday afternoon indicted the Nigerian Army ,_,  the Directorate of State Security ,_,  DSS and the Attorney General of the Federation saying they had no credible evidence to tag the eight youngsters killed last September in the Apo District of Abuja as agents of the Boko Haram terror group ._. In an 83 -_: page final report and decision ,_,  NHRC said its independent investigations could not support security claims that an army -_: DSS detachment which stormed an uncompleted building in the Apo/Gudu district of the Federal Capital Territory on September 20 last year was on operational target to flush out a Boko Haram sleeper cell ._. The security forces claimed at the time that over 100 inmates of Boko Haram fighters led by one Suleiman were hiding and coordinating an attack on Abuja from the building ,_,  and had buried arms at the nearby Gudu cemetery ._. After a 30 minutes military operation at the Apo building ,_,  seven of the inmates were killed ,_,  one later died in the hospital ,_,  while four were arrested and later detained ._. 
Some of the inmates escaped during the operation while some of the arrested inmates were expelled and asked never to return to Abuja ._. In its report ,_,  the NHRC said it investigated the contending claims and based its resolutions on two questions :_:  whether security forces applied proportionate force to the alleged threat and whether those killed were lawfully denied their lives ._. The NHRC slammed the security agencies for their argument that the victims were Boko Haram combatants ._. 
It said there is no credible evidence to reach such a conclusion and for that reason ,_,  the victims remain in the face of the law ,_,  protected civilians under the Geneva Convention act that governs the rule of law ._. The NHRC also rebuked the security forces for being trigger happy ,_,  saying their testimonies of self -_: defence were inconsistent and could not be accepted ._. Security forces acted without proper amount of case in the prevention of death ,_,  said the NHRC ,_,  describing the killings as unlawful violations of right to life of the deceased ._. Still on the question of proportionality of force ,_,  the NHRC said not only did security agents violate the right to life of the victims ,_,  even the survivors suffered non -_: lethal violations of right to life ,_,  physical integrity and livelihood ._. The Army ,_,  DSS and the Attorney General's office were asked to pay N10 million to each of the deceased family and N 5million to the 11 injured youth ._. Regarding the order to banish some of the youth from Abuja ,_,  the NHRC said the security forces had no legal backing to exclude or internally banish citizens ._. The NHRC gave two months to the three agencies to review and harmonise rules of engagement governing the operations of security agencies and bring them into compliance with international standards governing armed conflict ._. 
It should be against the law in Nigeria for a government official to seek medical attention abroad for any ailment whatsoever ._. I just returned last week from a short visit to London ._. 
One of the major news items there was the re -_: opening of an inquest into the Hillsborough disaster of 1989 when some spectators died during the F ._. A ._. 
Cup semi -_: final football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest ._. 
When I heard this ,_,  I shook my head ._. 
These oyinbos are still concerned about deaths that took place 25 years ago ._. 
But here in Nigeria ,_,  there is no serious inquest into the deaths of job -_: applicants to the Nigerian Immigration Service in several cities just this year ._. A Senate Committee spent a perfunctory two days paying lip -_: service to the disaster ._. 
The Minister of Interior ,_,  Abba Moro ,_,  refused to resign ._. 
His understanding of his responsibility did not go beyond mouthing vain platitudes ._. 
The government imposed no sanctions on those who turned our stadiums into death -_: traps simply in order to defraud the poor unemployed of 6 billion naira ._. 
A court -_: verdict ordered that 50 million naira compensation should be paid to the suspended Central Bank Governor for his unlawful detention for 24 hours ._. 
How much compensation should be paid for the senseless deaths of innocent job -_: seekersOfficial neglectThe government has passed legislation criminalising homosexuality in Nigeria without regard for the implication of this for fighting the scourge of HIV/AIDS ._. 
After South Africa ,_,  Nigeria has the highest number of HIV/AIDS patients in the world ._. 
Who cares if by criminalising homosexuality ,_,  homosexual patients are discouraged from seeking such medical treatment as are available locally Let them die; and if they don't ,_,  we can certainly stone them to death if we ever discover that they are homosexuals ._. Boko Haram insurgents go to churches to kill Christians ._. 
Christians go to church prayer -_: meetings to kill their enemies ._. 
Atheists go to babalawos to negotiate death -_: sentences for their rivals ._. 
It is no longer a big deal to hear of Fulani herdsmen killing the innocent ,_,  or of area -_: boys executing jungle -_: justice in our streets ._. 
It is now all par for the course ._. Let us face it :_:  there is no regard for human life in Nigeria ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  we love life ,_,  but promote and encourage death ._. 
We lavishly celebrate births ,_,  but disregard children after they are born ._. 
The Israelis would move heaven and earth to protect and defend the life of one Israeli ._. 
But governments in Nigeria don't give a damn whether a Nigerian lives or dies ._. 
Over three million Nigerians were slaughtered in a three -_: year civil war; and yet there is no national memorial commemorating our loss ._. 
The victims are gone ,_,  what else is new ._. Murder incorporatedHow much is a human being worth in Nigeria; not more than the cost of a hearty meal in a mama -_: put ._. 
If you want someone killed ,_,  you don't have to break the bank ._. 
You can get a contract -_: killer for as little as 1 ,_, 000 naira and the job will be done ._. 
The list of unresolved murders is so long ,_,  you begin to wonder what exactly the Nigerian police are doing ._. 
From Dele Giwa ,_,  to Alfred Rewane ,_,  to Anthony Ikhazoboh ,_,  to Bola Ige ,_,  to Harry Marshal ,_,  to Funso Willams; Nigerians continued to get slaughtered without any reprieve ._. If someone were to kill you today ,_,  the only people who may blink an eye are members of your family ._. 
Even they may be more concerned with sharing your property than with prosecuting your killers ._. 
As people come ostensibly to commiserate with your relatives about your death; so would they be asking if they can have your spanking stereo system ._. When I was living in a block of flats ,_,  our maiguard got drunk one night and was killed by a hit -_: and -_: run driver ._. 
His friends sent a delegation to the tenants ,_,  saying they needed money to send him home for burial ._. 
We contributed money and gave it to them ._. 
But as we watched from the window ,_,  they gathered round and shared the money among themselves ._. 
Who cares The man is dead ._. Medical deathsBy the law of averages ,_,  if you are a Nigerian the chances are high that you will be dead before your 40th birthday ._. 
It is amazing how many people kick the bucket after proverbially brief illnesses ._. 
We have hospitals where doctors can go on strike for months ,_,  while the government dilly -_: dallies ._. 
Indeed ,_,  hospitals are places where Nigerians go to die :_:  and not to be healed ._. 
If a relative of yours has to undergo surgery in Nigeria ,_,  it is time for fasting and prayer ._. You can even go to a hospital for vaccination against a disease and end up dead from that very disease because of an overdose of the vaccine ._. 
That is what killed my only sister ,_,  Yemisi ,_,  at the tender age of eighteen ._. 
It should be against the law in Nigeria for government officials to seek medical treatment abroad for any ailment whatsoever ._. 
Let them improve the medical facilities here at home or face the music with everyone else ._. We keep discovering new ways to send as many people as possible to early graves ._. 
We sell fake drugs ,_,  knowing they can either kill the sick or ensure that they die of neglected ailments ._. 
We live in unsanitary neighbourhoods ,_,  where rubbish piles up high in the streets ,_,  not caring that this makes us prone to diseases ._. 
We pump oil out of the Niger Delta ,_,  without regard for the pollution of the environment ._. 
The oil companies know they can get away with murder in Nigeria ,_,  doing things in our country that would bankrupt them if they dared to do them at home ._. Wasted livesIn Nigeria ,_,  we produce children ,_,  without sparing a thought for how they would be cared for ._. 
You can have a messenger in an office ,_,  earning 18 ,_, 000 naira a month; nevertheless he is the father of 12 children ._. 
How does he expect to take care of them He does not !_. 
He expects them to take care of him ._. 
From an early age ,_,  he distributes some among his relatives ._. 
He sends out the leftovers as sellers of chewing -_: gum and groundnuts on the streets ._. 
They become street -_: urchins and beggars required to make daily returns to him ._. 
What does it matter if they grow up to be kidnappers and armed -_: robbersBecause human life is disregarded ,_,  a whole segment of our population still cannot read and write; and yet we are in the 21st century ._. 
Because we have no regard for life ,_,  our policemen are as equally likely to shoot you and kill you as they are to protect you ._. 
If you are more fortunate ,_,  they might arrest you merely for walking on the streets and lock you up somewhere for 10 years without trial ._. Let me ask you this :_:  how many men have you ever heard of going to jail for raping women in Nigeria It is not because Nigerians are not rapists like other people ,_,  but that in Nigeria rape is not that big a deal ._. 
Neither is marrying under -_: aged girls ._. 
That actually happens to be the preferred pastime of our distinguished Senators in the National Assembly ._. University lecturers go on a strike for six months ._. 
Nobody seems to care that this is six wasted months in the life of hapless students ._. 
In serious countries ,_,  such neglect might be enough to bring down a government ._. 
Not in Nigeria ._. 
We all know our university education is largely useless anyway ._. 
Most graduates in Nigeria cannot write a sentence of English correctly without firing bullets ._. 
What does it matter if they waste six months while lecturers and the government stare each other down Everyone knows when they graduate they will waste even more time looking for non -_: existent jobs ._. Nobody caresIn our cities ,_,  you can go to work in the morning and find a dead man lying on the street ._. 
When you come back in the evening ,_,  you are likely to find him still there ._. 
Nobody really cares ._. Nobody cares that ,_,  as a result of being the highest users of generators in the world ,_,  we are killing ourselves with the fumes ._. 
Nobody cares that our women are dying by the tens of thousands from ingesting the smoke from cooking with firewood all day long ._. 
Nobody cares that our orthopedic hospitals now have glorified okada wards ,_,  full of people maimed and crippled by naira -_: drunk motorcyclists ._. 
Nobody cares that our flea -_: markets and supermarkets sell expired foods and our so -_: called pure water is responsible for the high incidence of typhoid ._. When they discourage the smoking of cigarettes in the West because of medically -_: proven research that it causes a lorry -_: load of deadly diseases ,_,  the tobacco industry finds a high -_: growth market in Nigeria with every encouragement from our easily -_: bought legislators ._. 
Our mechanics put fake spare -_: parts in our cars ,_,  not caring a hoot if that makes us vulnerable to accidents ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  if you are not killed while driving on the road ,_,  you can be killed while walking on the sidewalk because the okada -_: rider or the Keke Marwa driver does not believe the sidewalk is reserved for pedestrians ._. Corruption deathsCan you imagine it if the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 had been a Nigerian plane full of Nigerians Would the Nigerian government be particularly bothered to spend money in search of the plane ,_,  after all ,_,  what are 239 missing Nigerians in a country of 170 million There are so many Nigerians ,_,  we are easily expendable ._. 
Even if the government were to budget funds to search for the missing plane ,_,  it would not be amiss for some officials to chop the money ._. In 1992 ,_,  a Nigerian Air Force C -_: 130 transport plane crashed in Ejigbo near Lagos ,_,  killing all 200 passengers including top military officers ._. 
A government -_: sponsored memorial service ,_,  coordinated by Vice -_: Admiral Babatunde Elegbede ,_,  was organised in Abuja ,_,  and the widows of the dead were specially invited ._. 
However ,_,  instead of spending the budgeted money on the widows ,_,  it was pocketed ._. 
Instead of housing them in hotels in Abuja ,_,  they were dumped en masse and made to spend the night in an airport hangar ._. 
While there ,_,  they cursed Admiral Elegbede with one voice and prayed that he should come to a bad end ._. In June 1994 ,_,  Admiral Elegbede was assassinated by unknown gunmen ._. 
Over 70 bullets were pumped into his body ._. 
His assailants have never been found ._. 
National Human Rights Commission NHRC yesterday indicted the Attorney General of the Federation ,_,  the Nigerian Army and the Department of the State Security SSS for the killing of eight migrant workers in Abuja in September last year ._. The victims were killed in an uncompleted building on September 20 in Apo area of Abuja ._. Twelve people were injured and many others arrested in an operation meant to arrest suspected Boko Haram members ._. The security forces claimed they came under fire and responded in self defence ._. There was consistent demand by the public for the security people to produce the weapons used to attack them since the victims had been killed ,_,  injured or arrested ._. 
Such demand was never met ._. Most of those arrested during the operation have been released but some among them have been banished from Abuja for two years and warned not to talk to the press ,_,  a decision also widely condemned ._. However ,_,  chairman governing board of the rights commission Prof ._.  Chidi Odinkalu yesterday released an 83 -_: page final report on the killings following six months of investigations and public testimonies ._. He said there was no credible evidence to prove that the victims who were members of the National Association of Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association NATOMORAS were members of the Boko Haram sect ._. The report said that the claim by the DSS on self defence did not have any credible fact or evidence to kill the victims ._. The ruling reads in part :_:  There is no credible evidence to suggest or show that the victims in this case were members of JALISWAJ Jama'atu Ahlis Sunnah Lidda'awati Wal Jihad or involved in direct participation in hostilities ._. 
They were ,_,  therefore ,_,  protected ,_,  civilian non -_: combatants ._. The defence of self -_: defence asserted by the Respondents is not supported by the facts or evidence ._. Taking account of all the circumstances in this case ,_,  the application of lethal force was disproportionate and the killings of the eight deceased persons as well as the injuries to the eleven survivors were unlawful; andThere is no basis in law for confining detainees freed by the Respondents to internal banishment ._.

Association expresses delight with reportLeaders of Garki Modern Market Association have expressed satisfaction with the ruling of the Nigerian Human Rights Commission NHRC over the killing of 8 squatters by security forces ._. Murtala Abubakar the Secretary of the Association who spoke to Daily Trust yesterday said they were delighted with the outcome of the enquiry by NHRC ._. He said they were disappointed with the result of the Senate investigative report ,_,  noting that ,_,  we voted for the members of the National Assembly but they disappointed us ._. He said the Association is grateful for the monetary compensation for the victims ,_,  although there is no money that can return life ,_,  but the families of the victims will get some relief ._. 
Abubakar added that before the tragedy the victims were the bread winners of their families ._. No response yet  -_:  FGWhen contacted yesterday over this development ,_,  spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Justice Mr ._.

Onueke � All of a sudden the horse has now become a part of Igbo life ,_,  and young boys at animal markets in the South  -_: East have not only learnt how to ride ,_,  feed and look after the animal ,_,  they can now speak Hausa as well ._. Friday Nwite ,_,  19 ,_,  wakes up early each morning to feed the horses at the animal market located in Onueke ,_,  Ezza South local government area of Ebonyi state ._. 
He also carries out this ritual every evening ,_,  and over time a sort of bond has developed between him and the horses he looks after ._. 
A special bond has also developed between Friday and the Hausa traders who flourish in the neighbourhood ._. They love the Igbos who have come to share their passion for horses ,_,  while the Igbos look up to them for the rare tutelage on the horse they have come to enjoy at the animal market ._. 
He implies this as he speaks ,_,  stepping forward to collect some bits of grass ,_,  already gathered at one spot ,_,  and puts these between the horses ,_,  majority of which have been attached to strong sticks in the ground by means of ropes ._. The horses bend and began to chew ._. 
Then some of them suddenly start to neigh ._. 
The air is now heavy with the smell of horses as well as the smell of dry grass ._. It is an old ,_,  very deep smell which is hard to describe ._. 
Several other boys emerge and begin to join him in this activity ._. 
They are bilingual ,_,  and speak both Hausa and Igbo with ease ._. 
There is a mosque nearby ,_,  and outside it are a number of kettles ._. 
Later two young girls in Hijabs come along to serve breakfast ._. 
Friday says that Malam Danlami ,_,  who has had a long presence in the community going back many years ,_,  taught him how to feed the horses ._. 
His words Malam Danlami ,_,  my master ,_,  taught me how to feed the horses ,_,  and I learnt how to do it in one day ._. He adds that the meals for the horse is made up of grass ,_,  water and chaff ._. 
He tells Daily Trust that every Saturday one trailer bearing 48 horses arrives Onueke ._. 
But in the month of December ,_,  which is one of the high points in terms of the sale of horses in the area ,_,  3 trailer loads of horses arrive every Saturday ,_,  which means that 144 horses arrive there each Saturday in December ._. 
It is mentioned that outside December ,_,  it may take up to a week before the entire 48 horses are sold ._. Horses are transported from Maigatari in Jigawa State ,_,  as well as Cameroon down to Onueke ,_,  and most of the horses brought are weak polo horses from the north ._. 
Their feet are lame ,_, and the horses are no longer useful for the game of polo ._. 
On a related point ,_,  Friday says Some people leave here for Cameroon ._. 
They spend some months there ,_,  and then they return here after a while with many horses ._. He adds that horses are given as gifts by the wealthy sections of Igbo society ._. 
His words A big man can buy a horse and give another member of his class ._. 
The horse is also bought and used at funerals in Igbo society ._. 
During the burial a sort of performance is staged using horses ._. 
The horse races along at a steady pace ,_,  then it is made to stop all of a sudden ,_,  and then it raises its fore legs which is really a very impressive sight ._. 
After the performance ,_,  it is killed ,_,  cooked and eaten ._. 
Friday mentions that there is currently no work in his village within the state  ,_, and adds that he had no option but to migrate to Onueke ,_,  where under knowledgeable Hausa traders he has enjoyed learning how to look after horses ,_,  and to master many other aspects of the behaviour and make up of horses ._. Friday is not the only young man present who has something positive to say about the animal market ,_,  and how it has turned around life in the area ._. 
Uhuo Chigozie is the Chairman ,_,  Onueke Horse Dealers Union ._. According to him ,_,  horse meat is a special meal in Igboland It is eaten as a delicacy like pepper soup ._. They are ridden at burial ceremonies ,_,  and are made to do a little performance ,_,  he says ,_,  agreeing with the earlier respondent ._. 
His words It costs 5 ,_, 000 Naira to hire a horse to be ridden at an event ,_,  which is usually a burial ._. 
Sometimes ,_,  individuals who are into films come here and hire a horse at 10 ,_, 000 Naira ._. 
When a horse has been hired ,_,  the Igbo boys will now ride the horses to the respective communities ,_,  and also do the burial performance for them ._. 
This always impresses our Hausa friends ._. Contradicting Friday above ,_,  he says that when a trailer arrives with 48 horses ,_, it will take the traders 3 weeks to sell them off ._. 
Friday mentions it will take a week to dispose of the horses ._. 
He agrees that December is the month when the market realises its greatest sales each year ._. Uhuo Chigozie says that he was born and bred in Amuzu community ,_,  which is a part of Onueke ._. 
His words I have been seeing horses since I was a child ._. 
Then I used to follow the Hausa traders and watched them as they were feeding the horses and looking after them ._. 
I therefore became interested in the business ,_,  and I have been in the trade since 1999 ._. He says his involvement in the horse trade has been of tremendous help to him and his family ._. 
His words I have earned enough money to feed myself and family from this trade ._. 
It has been a wonderful experience ._. He adds that women are involved in the trade too ._. 
They come to the market and buy horses ,_,  which they slaughter and later they sell the meat ._. 
He explains They do this because of the lack of jobs ._. 
So ,_,  instead of them to stay idle ,_,  they come and buy horses and slaughter them on market days ._. He salutes the good relationship which they enjoy with the Hausa traders who live among them ._. 
According to him We take ourselves as one  ,_, and we are brothers and sisters ._. 
In our union here ,_, they are the executives ,_,  and Mallam Danlami is the number one patron here ._. The insurgency in the North -_: East has had a negative effect on the horse trade to the South -_: East ,_,  he now says ._. He explains We now pay 3 ,_, 000 Naira at each police checkpoint along the route to the east ._. 
But before the Boko Haram crisis we were only paying 200 Naira at each checkpoint ._. 
Thus ,_,  by the time we get to the east ,_,  we would have spent 120 ,_, 000 Naira as total payment made during the journey ._. 
This is a terrible over head ._. 
He says that one sign of the deep influence the Hausas have had on their Igbo hosts ,_,  is the fact that whenever horses are bought ,_,  the young Igbo boys will now ride the horses to the new owners either at Ikwo or Afikpo ._. 
Followers of the late former Chief of Staff Supreme Headquarters ,_,  Major -_: General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua rtd ,_,  yesterday said they had commenced legal and administrative processes to get the Peoples Democratic Movement PDM deregistered as a political party in the country ._. The PDM was one of the political parties registered by the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC June last year ,_,  but some members of the group have been resisting the registration of the group as a political party ._. The group said its loyalty remained with the Peoples Democratic Party PDP and that it was associates of the former Vice -_: President ,_,  Atiku Abubakar ,_,  that registered PDM as a political party ,_,  insisting that they remained members of the PDP ._. According to a communiqu� at the PDM meeting held at the Yar'Adua Centre ,_,  both administrative and legal processes should be initiated for the determination of the registration of PDM as a political party with a view to ensuring the withdrawal of the registration certificate ._. 
The communiqu� of the PDP members who had affiliation with PDM further said ,_,  That the PDM association is convinced that the antics of those who surreptitiously registered PDM as a political party should not be allowed to stand ,_,  considering genuine efforts that are being made to reform and bolster the credibility of the political system ._. The communiqu� said to realise objective of preventing the PDM from being usurped ,_,  the group set up a five -_: member Rapid Response Committee under the Chairmanship of Alhaji Shuaibu Y ._. 
Abdullahi ,_,  with Dr ._.  Dorncklaimz Enamhe as Secretary and saddled them with the task of going round the country with the aim of bringing back all members of PDM to the association ._. The group further stated that following the return of many members who were deceived into the PDM ,_,  which was registered as a political party ,_,  they resolved to invest considerable energy into the consolidation of the association into the pressure group it is designed to be and help reconcile its members within and outside the association ._. Earlier ,_,  the Chairman of the group ,_,  Senator Abubakar Mahdi ,_,  disassociated the followers of Yaradua in the PDM as a political party ,_,  saying that it was only the followers of Atiku that formed the PDM as a political party ._. According to Mahdi ,_,  permit me to take this opportunity to correct the erroneous impression often created in some sections of the media that the registered PDM comprises all loyalists of the late Tafidan Katsina ._. 
Nothing could be farther from the truth ._. The former Vice -_: President ,_,  Alhaji Atiku Abubakar ,_,  had confirmed in the media recently that his associates and aides registered the PDM as a party ._. 
It is therefore necessary to state here without any equivocation or fear of contradictions that our organisation is peopled by associates and loyalists of Shehu Yar'Adua ,_,  while the registered PDM is a party for Atiku Abubakar's associates and aides and should be so described henceforth in the media ._. 
We are here to discuss and take the necessary next step that will clear any air of doubt about our mission and vision as a political association and pressure group ._. 
Brothers and sisters ,_,  this meeting should not shy away from taking the bull by the horn and dealing with the pirates that registered PDM as apolitical party once and for all ._. 
This we should do within the ambit of morality and the law ,_,  the leader of the group said ._. The meeting was well attended by members of the Executive Committee and States Working Committees including ,_,  among others ,_,  the first Chairman of the late Major General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua's political family ,_,  Dr Farouk Abdulazeez ,_,  National Chairman of the association ,_,  Senator Abubakar Mahdi ,_,  former Minister of State for Foreign Affairs ,_,  Hon ._. 
Dubem Onyia ,_,  former Minister of State for Defence ,_,  Mr ._. 
Murtala Shehu Musa Yar'Adua ,_,  Chief Onyia Ejiofor and Dr Bala Ahmed Tafida ._. The meeting observed a minute silence in memory of all the great Nigerians who lost their lives in the series of Boko Haram attacks on civilian populations in Borno ,_,  Yobe ,_,  Adamawa ,_,  Benue ,_,  Nasarawa ,_,  Plateau ,_,  Kaduna and Zamfara States ._. 
It also paid tribute to the victims of the recent Nigeria Immigration Service NIS recruitment tragedy ._. 
As the debate on the speech of President Goodluck Jonathan to the National Conference continued yesterday ,_,  some delegates have called for a national government of two years with President Jonathan at the helm of affairs to enable him implement the recommendations of the conference ._. In his suggestion that the 2015 general elections be postponed for two years ,_,  Chief B ._. 
Leonard from the North -_: east said that there have been several reports of past conferences that were not implimented ._. 
He therefore said that the only way to ensure that the outcome of the present conference is implemented is to postpone the coming general elections in 2015 and form a government of national unity ._. According to Leonard ,_,  The president said we should think outside the box ._. 
We should adopt a government of national unity for the next two years ._. But ,_,  General A ._. B ._. 
Mamman from the Federal Capital Territory disagreed ._. 
He added that three months was not enough to have meaningful deliberations on the problems confronting Nigeria ._. 
He said there were rumours making the round about the tenure elongation and that the National Assembly's plans to sabotage the outcome of the conference ._. Another delegate raised an objection saying ,_,  If there is any need for us to apply for extension ,_,  it will be misconstrued to mean that the conference is supporting third term ._. At this point ,_,  the Chairman of the Conference ,_,  Justice Idris Kutigi cautioned delegates against such insinuations that may portray the conference in bad light ._. However ,_,  the former Minister of Environment ,_,  Hassan Adamu from Adamawa State appealled to the delegates to address once and for all ,_,  the issue of tenure of the office of the President ,_,  stating that if this is addressed ,_,  the unity of the country would have been addressed ._. In his contribution ,_,  the former Minister of Health ,_,  Prof ._.  Ihechukwu Madubuike called for the restructuring of Nigeria ,_,  saying ,_,  We need to reconstruct Nigeria by restructuring it along the lines of social inclusion ._. 
We should not confuse unity with uniformity ._. 
Nigeria is one of the incomplete projects of the 21st century ._. Nurudeen Lemu ,_,  a delegate from the National Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs NSCIA condemned the insecurity in the country ,_,  while condemning the religious acrimony between Christians and Muslims ,_,  which results in bloodletting ._. 
According to him ,_,  We condemn the murder of all Christians or Muslims not because of their religion ,_,  but because they are human beings ._. 
There is no compulsion in religion ._. 
The rule of law is the defender of the oppressed ._. 
We are all settlers; I pray that after this conference we will all grow in our humanity ._. 
He received a thunderous applause from the delegates ,_,  while the chairman described his comment as beautiful ._. General Zemani Lekwot from Kaduna State called for creation of more states ._. 
He said the conference has a duty to revisit the need to create new states and local governments ,_,  advocating for complete independence for local governments and also asked for the creation of state police ._. On insecurity ,_,  the delegate from Kaduna State called for a strong frontier force to man the borders ,_,  stating that the national identity card project should also be resuscitated ._. He reiterated the need for a new education curriculum that would prepare children for self -_: employment since it is obvious that government cannot create enough jobs ._. Anthony Adefuye from Lagos State listed Nigeria's problems as corruption ,_,  religion and the police ._. 
According to him ,_,  Someone was saying that ex -_: governors have jets ,_,  but even religious leaders have jets bought from the sweat of the poor who have no shoes ._. The Deputy Chairman of the conference ,_,  Prof ._.  Bolaji Akinyemi jokingly said that all those who said we are all corrupt will be denied lunch for the next three days ._. Another delegate from Taraba State ,_,  Isa Mafindi ,_,  who commended the president for convening the national conference ,_,  said ,_,  There is no basis for poverty in Nigeria if agriculture is given adequate attention ._. 
Many farmers do not benefit from the by -_: product of their produce ._. 
We have one of the worst form of meat processing in the world ,_,  which is responsible for some of the diseases afflicting the people ._. Adeniyi Akintola SAN ,_,  canvassed for the devolution of power ,_,  explaining that over centralisation of power at the centre was dangerous ._. He decried the new twist and change of style by corrupt officials ._. 
He said that public officers have adopted a new style of declaring their assets ._. 
He therefore suggested that assets declaration should be made alongside with the tax declaration ._. The conference observed a one -_: minute silence for victims of violence ,_,  including those of the Boko Haram insurgency ._. Earlier on ,_,  the former acting national chairman of PDP ,_,  Dr ._.  Bello Mohammed informed the delegates that the son of Chief Edwin Clark ,_,  who was abducted last week ,_,  had been released and in good health ._. 
He said ,_,  It was a very good news ,_,  this house should send a message of facilitation to Chief Clark ._. 
Government should take stern action to stem these cases of kidnapping and other crimes ._. He also said that about 120 people were massacred in some villages in Zamfara State ,_,  and appealed to the federal government and the security agents to address this persistent loss of lives ._. The former deputy senate president ,_,  Ibrahim Mantu ,_,  who decried tribalism and religious bigotry in the country ,_,  said poverty does not know any boundary ._. 
He called for a united Nigeria to address the problems confronting the nation ._. Alhaji Hassan Adamu from Adamawa State ,_,  in his contribution listed job creation ,_,  poverty ,_,  corruption ,_,  poor education and insecurity as some of the major problems confronting Nigeria ._. 
Another delegate ,_,  Yemi Fasamumini called for the castration of men that rape children ._. 
Her suggestion threw the conference into laughter ,_,  but she insisted saying ,_,  old men of 72 years that rape children of three years should be castrated to serve as a deterrent ._. In his contribution ,_,  Ledum Mittee bemoaned the environmental degradation in Ogoni land ,_,  especially in the light of injustice against the Ogonis ._. 
According to him ,_,  there must be justice and equity for this country to move forward ._. The former president of the Court of Appeal ,_,  Justice Mamman Nasir ,_,  at the plenary reaffirmed his belief in the unity of Nigeria ,_,  and therefore called on the federal government to tackle corruption and insecurity in the county ._. 
Abuja � We are all members of the Borno and Yobe States Peoples Forum who actively participated in the preparation of the Press conference held in Abuja on 30th March 2014 ._. 
The message of that Press conference which was held under the Chairmanship of our leader ,_,  Alhaji Adamu Ciroma ,_,  was widely reported on and generally well received ._. 
We fully subscribe to the content of the statement read on that occasion by Air Marshall Rtd Alamin Daggash and commend it to the attention of all those who are in a position of influence to help bring to a speedy end ,_,  the nightmare under which our people have been living for so long ._. However ,_,  we do realize that the nature of a Press conference and the short time allotted on such occasions necessitate some brevity ._. 
We therefore feel that it is still timely and topical to release this detailed document we prepared in collaboration with some members of the Forum which gives greater depth and further details to the message of the press conference ._. ____________________________________________________________________ Borno -_: Yobe Elders Allege Complicity of Security Agencies in Boko Haram Attacks ____________________________________________________________________For the most part of the last decade ,_,  the people of Borno and Yobe bore their grief and losses alone ._. 
There is hardly any household that has not lost a family member or close relative to the mindless carnage unleashed by Boko Haram ._. 
Property and livelihoods were destroyed or lost across the two states ,_,  and entire villages set ablaze ,_,  leading to thousands fleeing across the borders or being internally displaced ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  not all of the atrocities were committed by Boko Haram ,_,  as the Security Agencies deployed to fight them and protect the civilian population also had a hand in some of the atrocities visited on innocent civilians perceived to be Boko Haram supporters or sympathizers ._. Boko Haram's assassination and murder spree affected not only the defenceless rural dwellers and hundreds of innocent urban bystanders ,_,  but also ,_,  high profile politicians ,_,  businessmen and clerics ._. 
Even revered traditional rulers ,_,  including the Shehu of Borno and the Emir of Fika ,_,  were targeted by suicide bombers ,_,  but mercifully ,_,  their lives were spared ._. While all this was going on ,_,  for a long time ,_,  the people of Borno and Yobe did not see the Security agencies as their protectors ._. 
Neither did we feel any sense of solidarity from even our immediate neighbours in Nigeria as our horrendous suffering was viewed as if it was no different from those of the people of far -_: away lands as Syria or Afghanistan � no delegations of Traditional Rulers ,_,  religious groups and organisations ,_,  Labour Unions or even political parties to sympathise with us ._. 
Yes ,_,  there was a fleeting visit by the President and a well appreciated visit by a group of Governors ._. 
But by and large ,_,  we were left thoroughly alone with our suffering as if we did not belong in Nigeria ._. Our confidence in the Nigerian people's sensitivity to our suffering and their solidarity with our people were somewhat restored recently ,_,  especially after the Buni Yadi Secondary School massacre ,_,  when people from all walks of life rose up spontaneously and roundly condemned the Boko Haram and their atrocities ._. 
We wish to place on record our deep ,_,  profound and heartfelt appreciation to our compatriots at home and abroad for the outpouring of grief and sympathy and demonstration of solidarity over the colossal human tragedy that had befallen our communities ._. We wish to thank the women's groups in Abuja ,_,  Anambra ,_,  Ekiti ,_,  Lagos ,_,  Rivers and Oyo States :_:  students of the unity schools throughout the country; civil society groups ,_,  and our country men and women in the United Kingdom ,_,  Germany and West Virginia in the United States ._. 
We are greatly touched by the demonstration of common humanity by Filipino women who held solidarity rallies in far -_: away Philippines ._. 
The media also started to do more than just report the incidents and began to raise pertinent questions about the manner the insurgency was being confronted ._. 
Indeed ,_,  of recent ,_,  even the Security Agencies began a more robust ,_,  proactive campaign and started taking the initiative on the ground ._. 
To all of you and our individual friends ,_,  associates and acquaintances who have called to commiserate with us ,_,  we say thank you ._. 
May God grand us peace ,_,  social harmony and shared prosperity as we fulfil our common destiny ._. All these developments have led us to believe that what we perceived previously as non �concern of our compatriots to our plight and suffering was perhaps due to the insufficient awareness of the horrors our people of Borno and Yobe had been subjected to over the last five years ._. 
This memorandum is therefore ,_,  an effort ,_,  in part ,_,  to bridge this information gap ._. A brief background to the Insurgency and its metamorphosisYobe State experienced its first wave of violence in 2002 when a previously unknown group which called itself the Taliban ,_,  began its violent activities in some parts of the State ._. 
In December 2003 the group attacked police stations in Geidam and Kanamma ,_,  carting away sizeable number of weapons including AK47 assault rifles ._. 
In January 2004 ,_,  the group ,_,  on their way to Maiduguri ,_,  attacked 3 police stations in Damaturu ,_,  the capital of Yobe State ._. 
At least 18 people were killed in these attacks ._. 
Between 2004 and 2006 not much was heard about the Taliban ._. 
It was apparently undergoing transformation and gaining footholds in the neighbouring States ._. 
By 2007 the group had consolidated its main base in Borno State and christened themselves as Jama'atul Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati Wal Jihad ,_,  popularly known as Boko Haram ._. In June 2009 what started as an altercation between the Police and Boko Haram followers under the leadership of Mohammed Yusuf ,_,  ended up with the officers of the special anti -_: crime unit called Operation Flush opening fire on the group and injuring 17 people ._. 
Following the shootings ,_,  Mohammed Yusuf released several video tapes propagating his ideology and bowing to take revenge for the killings of his followers ._. On 26 July 2009 ,_,  members of the Boko Haram followed up on their revenge threat by attacking a police station in Bauchi ,_,  Bauchi State ._. 
Over the next few days Boko Haram carried out coordinated attacks on the police and government establishments in Borno ,_,  Bauchi ,_,  Yobe and Kano states ._. 
Clashes between members of Boko Haram and security forces continued all that week ,_,  with fierce street gun battles ._. 
By the end of the week over 30 police officers and 14 members of Boko Haram were killed ._. 
Tragically ,_,  more than 800 innocent people had also been killed by both the police and Boko Haram ._. 
Indeed the Al Jazeera news channel broadcast video footages taken at the time showed the police shooting and killing unarmed people who were not fleeing but lying flat on the ground to demonstrate their innocence ._. Following these incidents ,_,  Mohammed Yusuf ,_,  the Boko Haram leader was arrested and while in police custody ,_,  shot in cold blood ._. 
Although the video clip which captured this extra judicial killing had gone viral ,_,  not only Boko Haram members ,_,  but the entire Nigerian public were outraged when it was officially claimed that Yusuf was killed while trying to escape ._. 
This sowed the seed of distrust between the public and members of the Security Agencies who up to now had failed to win the hearts and minds of the people ._. 
Following this public outrage ,_,  an investigative committee looked into the affair ,_,  leading to 5 police officers being charged with murder ._. 
Five years on ,_,  the case has not been concluded ._. From 2009 ,_,  the group unleashed indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians; the abduction ,_,  rape ,_,  torture and killing of women and children; continued looting of people's homes ,_,  banks ,_,  and business premises; and attacks on military formations in Monguno ,_,  Maiduguri ,_,  Bama and others ._. 
In Yobe State ,_,  the attacks were concentrated mainly on policemen ,_,  paramilitary personnel and police stations ._. Boko Haram attacks on school children and the burning of school buildings reached their most inhuman levels with the cold -_: blooded murder of nine 9 students of Government Secondary School Damaturu in June 2013 ,_,  forty -_: two 42 students of Government Secondary School Mamudo in July 2013 ,_,  forty -_: four 44 students of College of Agricultural Gujba in July 2013 ,_,  and the gory slaughter of fifty -_: nine 59 school children whilst they slept at the Federal Government College ,_,  Buni Yadi in February this year ,_,  all in Yobe State ._. 
These attacks led to the closure of most schools outside the two State capitals ,_,  thus further worsening the educational situation of two of the most disadvantaged States in the country ._. 
Concerned individuals and groups continue to be bewildered by the seeming inability of the Federal Government's security agencies to protect the lives and properties of the citizens of these two States ._. 
The shocking level of audacity with which the Boko Haram insurgents attacked and killed people ,_,  destroyed towns and villages and committed unspeakable atrocities led many to raise questions as to whether there was the political will to fight it or the capacity of our Military to successfully defeat it ._. The conduct of the Security formation called the Joint Task Force JTF deployed to Borno State in June 2011 to fight and end the indiscriminate killing and torture of civilians by the Boko Haram lent credence to this public distrust with their heavy handedness against innocent civilians rather than facing the insurgents at whose approach they usually fled !_. 
The atrocities committed by the JTF were condemned and investigated by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and UNHCR ._. 
These atrocities were committed not only by the JTF ,_,  but the Security Agencies in general ,_,  and included;1 The arbitrary arrests ,_,  torture and killing of mostly innocent ,_,  able bodied young men and sometimes even women ,_,  children and the elderly from July ,_,  2009 to July 2013 ._. 
2 The inhuman treatment and extra -_: judicial killing of those arrested and detained in Maiduguri ,_,  Damaturu ,_,  Abuja and other detention centres across the country from July 2009 to date; 3 Breaking into people's homes in the middle of the night on the excuse of the State of Emergency and sometimes committing acts of robbery in the process; and the torching and looting of people's homes and business premises in the name of hunting for members of the Boko Haram Sect ._. 
The burning of almost all houses in Shehuri North ,_,  Kawar Maila ,_,  Budum Market and other parts of Maiduguri township as well as the torching of over half of the houses in Baga town by the Security Agencies are cases in point ._. 
They have also been accused of the recent massacre of over 600 unarmed civilians during the attack on Giwa Military Barracks in Maiduguri ._. 
4 The failure of the JTF to protect the identities of those who collaborated with them by providing useful information led to reprisal killings by the Boko Haram ._. 
This created a climate of fear of even being seen with the JTF ,_,  let alone provides them useful information ._. 
The distrust thus created between the security agencies and the general populace lingered and led to the creation of a self -_: help vigilante group called the Civilian JTF ._. In their 2012 report on Nigeria which focused mainly on Borno State ,_,  Amnesty International said the following :_: In the White Paper on the Report of the Presidential Committee on the Security Challenges in the North -_: East Zone of Nigeria ,_,  the Committee noted allegations of high -_: handedness against the JTF bordering on rape ,_,  destruction of property belonging to sect members ,_,  extrajudicial killings ,_,  and harassment and intimidation of Maiduguri residents ._. 
One of the Committee's recommendations was that the Rules of Engagement should be reviewed to reflect the low intensity nature of the military operations ,_,  not only in Maiduguri but in all similar operations ._. 
The government noted the recommendation and said that there were steps being taken by the Defence Headquarters to investigate the allegations and deal with it appropriately ._. Nothing further was seen or heard of these steps ._. In the course of the prosecution of the fight against the insurgency ,_,  it became evident to even ordinary civilians that the military and paramilitary personnel were overwhelmed ._. 
There were several reports of military personnel running and hiding during the recent attacks in several towns in Borno and Yobe States ._. 
The creation of a new Division ,_, 7 Div ,_,  of the Nigerian Army did not reflect any increase in troop presence in the rural areas which have borne most of the brunt of the attacks by the insurgents in recent months ._. Comments by the spokesperson of the Defence Headquarters that the recent upsurge in attacks on towns and villages in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States was as a result of the Military's flushing out the Boko Haram from their hideouts were greeted with disbelief as were similar previous claims which glaringly contradicted the facts on the ground ._. 
The towns and villages attacked in the three States within a spate of about 2 weeks included Kawuri ,_,  Konduga ,_,  Izghe ,_,  Bama ,_,  Michika ,_,  Buni Yadi ,_,  Mafa ,_,  Mainok ,_,  Jakana ,_,  Auno ,_,  Shuwa ,_,  Madagali ,_,  Malari ,_,  Wajonkoro ,_,  Ajigin ,_,  Benisheikh ,_,  Gamboru -_: Ngala and Kala Balge ._. 
Surely ,_,  a more robust military campaign against Boko Haram should have diminished rather than increased the insurgents' capacity to attack innocent civilians at will ._. It is most worrisome that ,_,  of recent ,_,  reports of mystery helicopters seen landing in the forests ,_,  dropping mercenaries ,_,  supplies ,_,  arms and ammunition to the insurgents have been common knowledge in the affected areas ._. 
These helicopters were spotted in the forests of North Eastern Nigeria and even as far as some parts of Kaduna and Katsina States ._. 
And yet the Defence spokesperson claimed that they had the capability to detect any aircraft crossing into our national air space ._. 
If that is indeed the case then the question arises as to the provenance and ownership of these mysterious helicopters ._. Impact on the CommunitiesThe UN report on Human Development Index HDI classified Borno and Yobe States as a part of the poorest regions on earth ,_,  as measured by access to education ,_,  health ,_,  potable water ,_,  electricity etc ._.  Majority of the citizens of the two States depend on agriculture for their livelihoods ._. 
The threat of attacks by insurgents has further worsened this situation because most farmers were unable to cultivate their farms in the past two to three years ._. 
Livestock production has also been seriously disrupted ._. 
Hunger ,_,  malnutrition and diseases have since started manifesting in many communities in the two States ._. As a result of the increased attacks by the insurgents ,_,  government workers in the rural areas were forced to migrate to the State capitals ,_,  leaving the rural dwellers without any social services such as education ,_,  healthcare ,_,  water ,_,  electricity etc ._.  It is also sad to note that thousands of Nigerian refugees who fled their communities are now living in temporary shelters in the neighbouring countries of Cameroon ,_,  Chad and Niger ._. 
In addition ,_,  it has been estimated that the number of Internally Displaced Persons IDPs in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States is in the millions ._. The dearth of medical facilities in Borno and Yobe States even in peace time has further compounded the suffering of victims and their families ._. 
In Maiduguri ,_,  the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital which is a referral ,_,  Tertiary level facility has been turned into a Primary Healthcare Centre where both staff and facilities are constantly overstretched ._. 
The intermittent strikes by medical and other health workers during this insurgency have further worsened the situation ._. Progress made ._. The recent collaboration between the military and the civilians that led to the formation of the Civilian JTF by a group of well -_: meaning youths is a well welcome development ._. 
These young men holding merely primitive tools as weapons who fought alongside our soldiers were able to arrest the insurgents and hand them over to the authorities ._. 
Shortly after this success ,_,  the Civilian JTF was curiously disbanded without any alternative plan to secure the cities ._. 
Both Maiduguri and Damaturu had experienced a rare period of peace before bombs and wonton shootings returned to Maiduguri recently after the Civilian JTF were disbanded ._. We welcome and endorse the government's Countering Violent Extremism Programme recently unveiled by the National Security Adviser as being a fresh thinking on the multifaceted and long term approach to countering violent extremism in Nigeria ,_,  of which Boko Haram is its most virulent manifestation ._. 
We see the programme as complementary and not a substitute to the military push to end the insurgency and continued military presence in the area ._. In this regard we urge the Boko Haram to seize the window of opportunity offered by the Government's soft approach alternative and therefore engage the newly resuscitated Dialogue Committee in the interest of all ._. We note the release by the Federal Government of 600 trucks of grains to the affected States of Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa from the Strategic Grain Reserve to alleviate the suffering of the victims of insurgency ._. 
However ,_,  this is nowhere near adequate ._. 
We however acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of Borno and Yobe State Governments in assisting victims of the insurgency in various ways ._. 
Despite that it was the primary responsibility of the Federal Government; the two State Governments also provided logistic support from their meagre resources to the Security Agencies in their fight against the insurgents ._. The encouraging effort of the National Emergency Relief Agency NEMA in distributing relief materials to victims in towns and villages attacked by the insurgents is also noted and commended ._. 
However both the quantities distributed and the coverage remain far short of actual needs ._. Recommendations on the way forwardArising from the foregoing ,_,  and to effectively arrest the activities of the insurgents in the North East ,_,  we are calling for action as follows :_: In line with section 142 b of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which states that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government ,_,  the Federal Government should comprehensively address the security and welfare of citizens in the affected areas ._. 
Towards this end :_: i The Federal Government should make proper budgetary allocations to address the effects of the insurgency in ALL the affected States ,_,  especially those that have been under a State of Emergency for nearly the past one year ._. 
A provision should be made in the 2014 Appropriation Act and subsequently ,_,  annually ,_,  for the purpose of reconstruction and rehabilitation of the affected areas ._. 
Not only that ,_,  all monies so voted must be applied in full ,_,  to the purposes intended;ii The Federal Government should ,_,  with all urgency ,_,  deploy additional troops to forestall a return by the insurgents after the current government offensive succeeds ,_,  as we are told ,_,  within the coming six weeks;iii The Federal Government should provide Safe Corridors for the delivery of relief from both local and international sources to the affected communities;iv The Federal Government should authorize more releases from the Strategic Grain Reserve on a regular basis as our people lack any purchasing power and their normal store of grains have been exhausted more than two years ago;v It should be ensured that both the quantity and frequency of distribution of relief materials by NEMA are multiplied several fold as those distributed so far are grossly inadequate ,_,  especially considering the fact that there have been little or no agricultural activity in the two States in the past two years;vi Pending the return of peace ,_,  the Federal and State Governments should ,_,  as a matter of urgency ,_,  transfer all students of secondary schools and colleges in the affected areas to safer zones within the states or to similar schools in neighbouring Geo -_: Political Zones ._. vii The Federal and State Governments should provide temporary shelters ,_,  to the most affected communities ,_,  including the provision of Primary Health Centres;viii The Federal Government should ,_,  as a matter of urgency ,_,  address the issue of the thousands of Nigerian refugees that have moved to various neighbouring countries ._. 
They should be repatriated and rehabilitated ._. 
The millions of IDPs should similarly be resettled and rehabilitated;ix While longer term remedies are being worked out ,_,  the Federal Government should ,_,  as an immediate measure ,_,  adopt a deliberate strategy for poverty alleviation through Sure -_: P and other skills acquisition programmes for the youth;x The Federal and State Governments should remodel and reconstruct all destroyed Primary and Secondary Schools and Colleges with maximum security features to forestall future attacks;xi The Federal Government should broaden the scope of the Almajiri model schools and extend them to Borno and Yobe States so that the teeming number of children and youths out of school and ,_,  therefore ,_,  easy prey for Boko Haram recruitment ,_,  would be fully absorbed into formal education;xii We urge both the Federal and State Governments to provide well equipped and adequately staffed Medical Centres to cater for the large number of casualties ._. 
These should also include Trauma Centres to treat physical and psychological trauma;xiii We urge both the Federal and State Governments to initiate programs that offer the local vigilante groups Civilian JTF training in various skills and employment after the insurgency is ended;xiv We call on the Federal government to establish an Emergency Special Intervention Fund under a States Reconstruction & Rehabilitation Committee which should be managed by a Board of Trustees made up of persons of high integrity ,_,  with the sole purpose of providing quick wins and improving the quality of life of our people ._. 
In our estimation not less than N300 billion ,_,  i ._. e ._. 
N60 billion a year ,_,  over a period of 5 years is required ._. 
The reconstruction projects/programmes to be pursued with this Fund will have a balming effect on the long suffering people in the affected areas ._. 
A Special Adviser should be appointed by the President to oversee and coordinate the reconstruction and rehabilitation projects and programmes in these States;xv We appeal for the revitalization of the Hadejia -_: Jamaare ,_,  Kumadugu Yobe and the Chad Basin to revive agriculture in these areas and create job opportunities for the people;xvi We urge all UN and bilateral agencies ,_,  including International Non -_: Governmental Organizations NGOs ,_,  to partner with our States in the reconstruction and rehabilitation process;xvii We call on the Federal Government to implement the recommendations of the Amb ._. 
Usman Gaji Galtimari and Barr ._. 
Tanimu Turaki Presidential Committees ,_,  and to revisit the 2009 Report of the NSA ,_,  CDS ,_,  IGP and CDI ._. 
It is the considered view of many commentators that ,_,  had the 2009 Report of the NSA ,_,  CDS ,_,  IGP and CDI been implemented ,_,  the insurgency would have been largely contained by now ._. It is our considered view that immediate action is required to take all necessary steps to defeat this murderous and criminal insurgency and for the campaign to be carried out within standard rules of engagement by safeguarding the fundamental human rights of the population ._. 
This requires seeking active cooperation and engagement of our immediate neighbours to jointly monitor our borders in order to stem cross -_: border movement of the insurgents ,_,  cut their source of supplies ,_,  and destroy their bases and training camps ._. 
The recent move by Government to collaborate with our neighbouring countries on cross -_: border movement of insurgents is a step in the right direction ._. 
We should also seek the active support of the US ,_,  the EU and all other friendly countries with the requisite capability to provide satellite based high resolution earth imaging systems to track the movement of the insurgents ._. In the short term ,_,  Government should urgently begin the reconstruction of all social infrastructures and rehabilitation of all internally and externally displaced persons ._. 
The support of specialized international organizations with the required experience ,_,  skills and expertise should be sought for the implementation of these programmes ._. In conclusion ,_,  we urge the government ,_,  politicians ,_,  religious and traditional leaders ,_,  the Press and the general public not to trivialize or play politics with human lives ,_,  the lives of Nigerians of all faiths ,_,  and ethnicities and the lives of our servicemen and women who have also been killed in the line of duty ._. 
This is a criminal insurgency ,_,  pure and simple ,_,  and we should as a nation ,_,  be united and resolute in fighting and defeating it ._. 
It is expected that the Federal Government will give the necessary inspirational leadership in this regard ._. All our requests and suggestions are geared towards discouraging idleness ,_,  creating quality educational opportunities and increasing employment and productivity thereby reducing poverty and vulnerability of our youths for manipulation by agents of destruction ._. 
This will help improve the quality of life of the people in Borno and Yobe States in particular ,_,  and the nation in general ._. Ambassador Baba Gana Kingibe ,_,  CFR Ambassador Baba Kura Kaigama ,_,  OFR ,_,  and Architect Ibrahim Bunu
The NHRC ordered N10 million compensation to each family of the eight victims killed; and N5 million to each person injured during the Apo raid ._. The Nigerian Army and the Department of State Security Services ,_,  DSS ,_,  acted unprofessionally and illegally by killing eight residents of an uncompleted building in Apo area of Abuja last year ,_,  a final report by the National Human Rights Commission ,_,  NRC ,_,  said ._. The Commission investigated the September 20 ,_,  2013 killing of the victims who died during a joint operation of the Army and the DSS ._. The Chairman of the Rights Commission ,_,  Chidi Odinkalu ,_,  while reading from the 83 -_: report said the commission did not receive any positive evidence from the DSS to show that the victims are members of the Boko Haram terrorist group ._. He said that the agency's poor reports support the commission's conclusion that the victims were poor artisans and squatters at the premises ._. 
The victims ,_,  he said ,_,  were at the wrong place at the wrong time ._. Mr ._. 
Odinkalu also condemned the nonchalant attitude of Adekunle Salisu ,_,  who represented his mother and owner of the uncompleted building ,_,  Adunni Oluwole Salisu ,_,  believed to be a relative of former President Olusegun Obasanjo ._. He noted that Mr ._. 
Salisu's inability to account for the whereabouts of his employee ,_,  Joseph the security guard at the premises as well as his testimonies shows that he has no regard for human life or had prior knowledge of the operation by the security operative ._. He also condemned the inability of the Army and the DSS to call Mr ._. 
Salisu for questioning or hold him accountable for the whereabouts of people in his premises ._. Mr ._. 
Salisu's conduct in this circumstance is unreasonable and suspiciously unusual ,_,  more particularly where the incident occurred barely two days after he issued instructions to Mr ._. 
Joseph to clear all the occupants in the premises with an accompanied threat ,_,  Mr ._. 
Odinkalu said ._. The killingsThe NHRC ,_,  in its report ,_,  ordered the DSS and Army to pay N10 million compensation to the families of each of the eight victims killed; and N5 million to each person injured during the Apo raid ._. In the 83 -_: page final report ,_,  the NHRC faulted the logic of the September midnight operation that saw anArmy -_: DSS detachment storm an uncompleted building in the Apo/Gudu district of Abuja ,_,  for a presumed operation to flush out a Boko Haram sleeper cell ._. The security forces later claimed that over 100 Boko Haram fighters led by one Suleiman were hiding and planning an attack on Abuja from the building; and had buried arms at the nearby Gudu cemetery ._. After the 30 -_: minute midnight operation at the building ,_,  seven of the residents were killed instantly ._. 
One person later died in the hospital ,_,  while four were arrested ._. Residents of the area and witnesses had told PREMIUM TIMES that the victims were homeless and unarmed artisans and tricycle riders whose only crime was that they were residing in the uncompleted building ._. Some of the residents escaped during the operation and others were expelled and asked never to return to Abuja ._. The security operatives claimed that they acted on self -_: defence and also made use of Rules of Engagement as then tendered by the Nigeria Army ,_,  Brigade of Guards ._. Army may appealIn his reaction to the report ,_,  an Assistant Director of Legal Services at the Defence Headquarters ,_,  G ._. O ._. 
Anayalebechi ,_,  said the Nigerian Army is likely to challenge the directive of the NHRC ._. Mr ._. 
Anyalebechi ,_,  a Colonel ,_,  stated the Army's position at the premises of the NHRC where the commission presented its report on the Apo killings ._. It is not ascertained whether the victims fell under the bullets of the Nigerian Army ,_,  the fact remains that we acted on self -_: defence and except a forensic investigation is carried out ,_,  it cannot beestablished without doubt that the Nigerian Army is responsible ._. 
That decision is likely to be challenged ,_,  Mr ._. 
Anyalebechi said ._. He ,_,  however ,_,  said he was speaking as a lawyer and not for the Nigerian Army ._. Well ,_,  I'm speaking my mind as lawyer; I'm not speaking for the Nigerian Army ,_,  the colonel ,_,  who represented the Defence Headquarters at the presentation ,_,  said ._. We are vindicatedNkereuwem Akpan ,_,  a lawyer representing the National Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association ,_,  NATCOMORAS ,_,  where most of the victims belonged ,_,  appreciated the efforts of the commission ._. He said while his clients had in December 2013 ,_,  given the Federal Government 72 hours to pay N500 million compensation to the victims of the operation ,_,  the N10 million compensation as directed by the NHRC ,_,  is punitive enough ._. In fact ,_,  I am most obliged to the commission for a wonderful job well done ,_,  the compensation is not necessarily as per monetary value ,_,  it is to show remorse for loss of certain lives which money cannot cover for ,_,  Mr ._.

�The US military is making deeper inroads into Africa ,_,  including military involvement with at least 49 of 54 nations ._. 
But there is nothing to suggest that these interventions actually help end Africa's post -_: colonial conflictsLion Forward Teams Echo Casemate Juniper MicronYou could be forgiven if this jumble of words looks like nonsense to you ._. 
It isn't ._. 
It's the language of the U ._. S ._.  military's simmering African interventions; the patois that goes with a set of missions carried out in countries most Americans couldn't locate on a map; the argot of conflicts now primarily fought by proxies and a former colonial power on a continent that the U ._. S ._.  military views as a hotbed of instability and that hawkish pundits increasingly see as a growth area for future armed interventions ._. Since 9/11 ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  military has been making inroads in Africa ,_,  building alliances ,_,  facilities ,_,  and a sophisticated logistics network ._. 
Despite repeated assurances by U ._. S ._. 
Africa Command AFRICOM that military activities on the continent were minuscule ,_,  a 2013 investigation by TomDispatch exposed surprisingly large and expanding U ._. S ._.  operations  -_:  -_:  including recent military involvement with no fewer than 49 of 54 nations on the continent ._. 
Washington's goal continues to be building these nations into stable partners with robust ,_,  capable militaries ,_,  as well as creating regional bulwarks favorable to its strategic interests in Africa ._. 
Yet over the last years ,_,  the results have often confounded the planning  -_:  -_:  with American operations serving as a catalyst for blowback to use a term of CIA tradecraft ._. A U ._. S ._.  -_: backed uprising in Libya ,_,  for instance ,_,  helped spawn hundreds of militias that have increasingly caused chaos in that country ,_,  leading to repeated attacks on Western interests and the killing of the U ._. S ._.  ambassador and three other Americans ._.  url= Tunisia /url has become ever more destabilized ,_,  according to a top U ._. S ._.  commander in the region ._. 
Kenya and Algeria were hit by spectacular ,_,  large -_: scale terrorist attacks that left Americans dead or wounded ._. 
South Sudan ,_,  a fledgling nation Washington recently midwifed into being that has been slipping into civil war ,_,  now has more than 870 ,_, 000 displaced persons ,_,  is facing an imminent hunger crisis ,_,  and has recently been the site of mass atrocities ,_,  including rapes and killings ._. 
Meanwhile ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  -_: backed military of Mali was repeatedly defeated by insurgent forces after managing to overthrow the elected government ,_,  and the U ._. S ._.  -_: supported forces of the Central African Republic CAR failed to stop a ragtag rebel group from ousting the president ._. In an effort to staunch the bleeding in those two countries ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  has been developing a back -_: to -_: the -_: future military policy in Africa  -_:  -_:  making common cause with one of the continent's former European colonial powers in a set of wars that seem to be spreading ,_,  not staunching violence and instability in the region ._. THE FRENCH CONNECTIONAfter establishing a trading post in present -_: day Senegal in 1659 ,_,  France gradually undertook a conquest of West Africa that ,_,  by the early twentieth century ,_,  left it with a vast colonial domain encompassing present -_: day Burkina Faso ,_,  Benin ,_,  Chad ,_,  Guinea ,_,  Ivory Coast ,_,  Mali ,_,  Niger ,_,  and Senegal ,_,  among other places ._. 
In the process ,_,  the French used Foreign Legionnaires from Algeria ,_,  Goumiers from Morocco ,_,  and Tirailleurs from Senegal ,_,  among other African troops ,_,  to bolster its ranks ._. 
Today ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  is pioneering a twenty -_: first -_: century brand of expeditionary warfare that involves backing both France and the armies of its former colonial charges as Washington tries to accomplish its policy aims in Africa with a limited expenditure of blood and treasure ._. In a recent op -_: ed for the Washington Post ,_,  President Barack Obama and French President Fran�ois Hollande outlined their efforts in glowing terms :_: In Mali ,_,  French and African Union forces  -_:  -_:  with U ._. S ._.  logistical and information support  -_:  -_:  have pushed back al -_: Qaeda -_: linked insurgents ,_,  allowing the people of Mali to pursue a democratic future ._. 
Across the Sahel ,_,  we are partnering with countries to prevent al -_: Qaeda from gaining new footholds ._. 
In the Central African Republic ,_,  French and African Union soldiers  -_:  -_:  backed by American airlift and support  -_:  -_:  are working to stem violence and create space for dialogue ,_,  reconciliation ,_,  and swift progress to transitional elections ._. Missing from their joint piece ,_,  however ,_,  was any hint of the Western failures that helped facilitate the debacles in Mali and the Central African Republic ,_,  the continued crises plaguing those nations ,_,  or the potential for mission creep ,_,  unintended consequences ,_,  and future blowback from this new brand of coalition warfare ._. 
The U ._. S ._.  military ,_,  for its part ,_,  isn't saying much about current efforts in these two African nations ,_,  but official documents obtained by TomDispatch through the Freedom of Information Act offer telling details ,_,  while experts are sounding alarms about the ways in which these military interventions have already fallen short or failed ._. OPERATION JUNIPER MICRONAfter 9/11 ,_,  through programs like the Pan -_: Sahel Initiative and the Trans -_: Saharan Counterterrorism Partnership ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into training and arming the militaries of Mali ,_,  Niger ,_,  Chad ,_,  Mauritania ,_,  Nigeria ,_,  Senegal ,_,  Morocco ,_,  Algeria ,_,  and Tunisia in order to promote stability ._. 
In 2013 ,_,  Captain J ._. 
Dane Thorleifson ,_,  the outgoing commander of an elite ,_,  quick -_: response force known as Naval Special Warfare Unit 10 ,_,  described such efforts as training proxy forces in order to build critical host nation security capacity; enabling ,_,  advising ,_,  and assisting our African CT counterterror partner forces so they can swiftly counter and destroy al -_: Shabab ,_,  AQIM Al -_: Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb  ,_,  and Boko Haram ._. 
In other words ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  military is in the business of training African armies as the primary tactical forces combatting local Islamic militant groups ._. The first returns on Washington's new and developing form of light footprint warfare in Africa have hardly been stellar ._. 
After U ._. S ._.  and French forces helped to topple Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 ,_,  neighboring Mali went from bulwark to basket case ._. 
Nomadic Tuareg fighters looted the weapons stores of the Gaddafi regime they had previously served ,_,  crossed the border ,_,  and began taking over northern Mali ._. 
This ,_,  in turn ,_,  prompted a U ._. S ._.  -_: trained officer  -_:  -_:  a product of the Pan -_: Sahel Initiative  -_:  -_:  to stage a military coup in the Malian capital ,_,  Bamako ,_,  and oust the democratically elected president of that country ._. 
Soon after ,_,  the Tuareg rebels were muscled aside by heavily -_: armed Islamist rebels from the homegrown Ansar al -_: Dine movement as well as al -_: Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ,_,  Libya's Ansar al -_: Shariah ,_,  and Nigeria's Boko Haram ,_,  who instituted a harsh brand of Shariah law ,_,  creating a humanitarian crisis that caused widespread suffering and sent refugees streaming from their homes ._. In January 2013 ,_,  former colonial power France launched a military intervention ,_,  code -_: named Operation Serval ,_,  to push back and defeat the Islamists ._. 
At its peak ,_,  4 ,_, 500 French troops were fighting alongside West African forces ,_,  known as the African -_: led International Support Mission in Mali AFISMA ,_,  later subsumed into a U ._. N ._.  -_: mandated Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali MINUSMA ._. 
The AFISMA force ,_,  as detailed in an official U ._. S ._. 
Army Africa briefing on training missions obtained by TomDispatch ,_,  reads like a who's who of American proxy forces in West Africa :_:  Niger ,_,  Guinea ,_,  Burkina Faso ,_,  C�te d'Ivoire ,_,  Togo ,_,  Senegal ,_,  Benin ,_,  Liberia ,_,  Chad ,_,  Nigeria ,_,  Gambia ,_,  Ghana ,_,  and Sierra Leone ._. Under the moniker Juniper Micron ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  military supported France's effort ,_,  airlifting its soldiers and materiel into Mali ,_,  flying refueling missions in support of its airpower ,_,  and providing intelligence ,_,  surveillance ,_,  and reconnaissance ISR through drone operations out of Base Aerienne 101 at Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey ,_,  the capital of neighboring Niger ._. 
The U ._. S ._. 
Army Africa AFISMA document also makes reference to the deployment to Chad of an ISR liaison team with communications support ._. 
Despite repeated pledges that it would put no boots on the ground in troubled Mali ,_,  in the spring of 2013 ,_,  the Pentagon sent a small contingent to the U ._. S ._. 
Embassy in Bamako and others to support French and MINUSMA troops ._. After issuing five media releases between January and March of 2013 about efforts to aid the military mission in Mali ,_,  AFRICOM simply stopped talking about it ._. 
With rare exceptions ,_,  media coverage of the operation also dried up ._. 
In June ,_,  at a joint press conference with President Obama ,_,  Senegal's President Macky Sall did let slip that the U ._. S ._.  was providing almost all the food and fuel used by MINUSMA as well as intervening to assist us with the logistics after the French response ._. A January 2014 Stars and Stripes article mentioned that the U ._. S ._.  air refueling mission supporting the French ,_,  run from a U ._. S ._.  airbase in Spain ,_,  had already distributed 15 ._. 6 million gallons of fuel ,_,  logging more than 3 ,_, 400 flying hours and that the effort would continue ._. 
In February ,_,  according to military reports ,_,  elements of the Air Force's 351st Expeditionary Refueling Squadron delivered their one millionth pound of fuel to French fighter aircraft conducting operations over Mali ._. 
A December 2013 briefing document obtained by TomDispatch also mentions 181 U ._. S ._.  troops ,_,  the majority of them Air Force personnel ,_,  supporting Operation Juniper Micron ._. Eager to learn where things stood today ,_,  I asked AFRICOM spokesman Benjamin Benson about the operation ._. 
We're continuing to support and enable the French and international partners to confront AQIM and its affiliates in Mali ,_,  he told me ._. 
He then mentioned four key current mission sets being carried out by U ._. S ._.  forces :_:  information -_: sharing ,_,  intelligence and reconnaissance ,_,  planning and liaison teams ,_,  and aerial refueling and the airlifting of allied African troops ._. U ._. S ._. 
Army Africa documents obtained by TomDispatch offer further detail about Operation Juniper Micron ,_,  including the use of Lion Forward Teams in support of that mission ._. 
I asked Benson for information about these small detachments that aided the French effort from Chad and from within Mali itself ._. 
I don't have anything on that ,_,  was all he would say ._. 
A separate briefing slide ,_,  produced for an Army official last year ,_,  noted that the U ._. S ._.  military provided support for the French mission from Rota and Moron ,_,  Spain; Ramstein ,_,  Germany; Sigonella ,_,  Italy; Kidal and Bamako ,_,  Mali; Niamey ,_,  Niger; Ouagadougou ,_,  Burkina Faso; and N'Djamena ,_,  Chad ._. 
Benson refused to offer information about specific activities conducted from these locations ,_,  preferring to speak about air operations from unspecified locations and only in generalities ._. Official military documents obtained by TomDispatch detail several U ._. S ._.  missions in support of proxy forces from the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali ,_,  including a scheduled eight weeks of pre -_: deployment training for troops from Niger in the summer of 2013 ,_,  five weeks for Chadian forces in the autumn ,_,  and eight weeks in the autumn as well for Guinean soldiers ,_,  who would be sent into the Malian war zone ._. 
I asked Benson about plans for the training of African forces designated for MINUSMA in 2014 ._. 
In terms of the future on that ._. 
I don't know ,_,  was all he would say ._. Another official briefing slide produced by U ._. S ._. 
Army Africa notes ,_,  however ,_,  that from January through March 2014 ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  planned to send scores of trainers to prepare 1 ,_, 400 Chadian troops for missions in Mali ._. 
Over the same months ,_,  other U ._. S ._.  personnel were to team up with French military trainers to ready an 850 -_: man Guinean infantry force for similar service ._. 
Requests for further information from the French military about this and other missions were unanswered before this article went to press ._. OPERATION ECHO CASEMATELast spring ,_,  despite years of U ._. S ._.  assistance ,_,  including support from Special Operations forces advisors ,_,  the Central African Republic's military was swiftly defeated and the country's president was ousted by Seleka ,_,  a mostly Muslim rebel group ._. 
Months of violence followed ,_,  with Seleka forces involved in widespread looting ,_,  rape ,_,  and murder ._. 
The result was growing sectarian clashes between the country's Muslim and Christian communities and the rise of Christian anti -_: balaka militias ._. 
Balaka means machete in the local Sango language ._. 
These militias have ,_,  in turn ,_,  engaged in an orgy of atrocities and ethnic cleansing directed against Muslims ._. In December ,_,  backed by a United Nations Security Council resolution and in a bid to restore order ,_,  France sent troops into its former colony to bolster peacekeepers from the African -_: led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic MISCA ._. 
As with the Mali mission ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  joined the effort ,_,  pledging up to $60 million in military aid ,_,  pouring money into a trust fund for MISCA ,_,  and providing airlift services ,_,  as well as training African forces for deployment in the country ._. Dubbed Echo Casemate ,_,  the operation  -_:  -_:  staged out of Burundi and Uganda  -_:  -_:  saw the U ._. S ._.  military airlift hundreds of Burundian troops ,_,  tons of equipment ,_,  and more than a dozen military vehicles into that strife -_: torn land in just the first five days of the operation ,_,  according to an AFRICOM media release ._. 
In January ,_,  at France's request ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  began airlifting a Rwandan mechanized battalion and 1 ,_, 000 tons of their gear in from that country's capital ,_,  Kigali ,_,  via a staging area in Entebbe ,_,  Uganda where the U ._. S ._.  maintains a cooperative security location and from which U ._. S ._.  contractors had previously flown secret surveillance missions ._. 
The most recent airlift effort took place on February 6th ,_,  according to Benson ._. 
While he said that no other flights are currently scheduled ,_,  he confirmed that Echo Casemate remains an ongoing operation ._. Asked about U ._. S ._.  training efforts ,_,  Benson was guarded ._. 
I don't have that off the top of my head ,_,  he told me ._. 
We do training with a lot of different countries in Africa ._. 
He offered little detail about the size and scope of the U ._. S ._.  effort ,_,  but a December 2013 briefing document obtained by TomDispatch mentions 84 U ._. S ._.  personnel ,_,  the majority of them based in Burundi ,_,  supporting Operation Echo Casemate ._. 
The New York Times recently reported that the U ._. S ._.  refrained from putting American boots on the ground in the Central African Republic ,_,  but the document clearly indicates that a Lion Forward Team of Army personnel was indeed sent there ._. Another U ._. S ._. 
Army Africa document produced late last year noted that the U ._. S ._.  provided military support for the French mission in that country from facilities in Germany ,_,  Italy ,_,  Uganda ,_,  Burundi ,_,  and the Central African Republic itself ._.

As U ._. S ._.  personnel deploy to Europe as part of Washington's African wars ,_,  additional European troops are heading for Africa ._. 
Last month ,_,  another of the continent's former colonial powers ,_,  Germany ,_,  announced that some of its troops would be sent to Mali as part of a Franco -_: German brigade under the aegis of the European Union EU and would also aid in supporting an EU peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic ._.

In January ,_,  France announced that it was reorganizing its roughly 3 ,_, 000 troops in Africa's Sahel region to reinforce a logistical base in Abidjan ,_,  the capital of C�te d'Ivoire ,_,  transform N'Djamena ,_,  Chad ,_,  into a hub for French fighter jets ,_,  concentrate special operations forces in Burkina Faso ,_,  and run drone missions out of Niamey ,_,  Niger already a U ._. S ._.  hub for such missions ._. SCRAMBLING AFRICAOperations by French and African forces ,_,  bolstered by the U ._.

At the same time ,_,  the intervention caused a veritable terror diaspora that helped lead to attacks in Algeria ,_,  Niger ,_,  and Libya ,_,  without resolving Mali's underlying instability ._. Writing in the most recent issue of the CTC Sentinel ,_,  the official publication of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point ,_,  analyst Bruce Whitehouse points out that the Malian government has yet to reassert its authority in the north of the country ,_,  reform its armed forces ,_,  tackle graft ,_,  or strengthen the rule of law :_:  Until major progress is made in each of these areas ,_,  little can be done to reduce the threat of terrorism ._.  the underlying causes of Mali's 2012 instability  -_:  -_:  disaffection in the north ,_,  a fractured military ,_,  and systemic corruption  -_:  -_:  have yet to be fully addressed by the Malian government and its international partners ._. The situation may be even worse in the Central African Republic ._. 
When France sent troops to halt violence between Christians and Muslims in Central African Republic ,_,  John Irish and Daniel Flynn of Reuters recently reported ,_,  commanders named the mission Sangaris after a local butterfly to reflect its short life ._. 
Three months later ,_,  it is clear they badly miscalculated ._. 
Instead ,_,  violence has escalated ,_,  more than one million people have been displaced ,_,  tens of thousands have been killed ,_,  looting has occurred on a massive scale ,_,  and last month U ._. S ._. 
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper informed Congress that much of the country has devolved into lawlessness ._. It is also quickly becoming a regional arms -_: smuggling hot spot ._. 
With millions of weapons reportedly unaccounted for as a result of the pillaging of government armories ,_,  it's feared that weaponry will find its way into other continental crisis zones ,_,  including Nigeria ,_,  Libya ,_,  and the Democratic Republic of Congo ._. In addition ,_,  the coalition operation there has failed to prevent what ,_,  after a visit to the largely lawless capital city of Bangui last month ,_,  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres called ethnic -_: religious cleansing ._. 
Amnesty International found much the same ._. 
Once vibrant Muslim communities in towns and cities throughout the country have been completely destroyed as all Muslim members have either been killed or driven away ._. 
Those few left behind live in fear that they will be attacked by anti -_: balaka groups in their towns or on the roads ,_,  the human rights group reported ._. 
While an African Union peacekeeping force ,_,  the African -_: led International Support Mission to the Central African Republic MISCA ,_,  supported by French troops ,_,  has been deployed in the country since early December 2013 ,_,  they have failed to adequately protect civilians and prevent the current ethnic cleansing from taking place ._. FRENCH WINE IN NEW BOTTLESWe're not involved with the fighting in Mali ,_,  AFRICOM spokesman Benjamin Benson told me ,_,  emphasizing that the U ._. S ._.  military was not engaged in combat there ._. 
But Washington is increasingly involved in the growing wars for West and Central Africa ._. 
And just about every move it has made in the region thus far has helped spread conflict and chaos ,_,  while contributing to African destabilization ._. 
Worse yet ,_,  no end to this process appears to be in sight ._. 
Despite building up the manpower of its African proxies and being backed by the U ._. S ._.  military's logistical might ,_,  France had not completed its mission in Mali and will be keeping troops there to conduct counterrorism operations for the foreseeable future ._. Similarly ,_,  the French have also been forced to send reinforcements into the Central African Republic and the U ._. N ._.  has called for still more troops ,_,  while Chadian MISCA forces have been repeatedly accused of attacking civilians ._. 
In a sign that the U ._. S ._.  -_: backed French military mission to Africa could spread ,_,  the Nigerian government is now requesting French troops to help it halt increasingly deadly attacks by Boko Haram militants who have gained strength and weaponry in the wake of the unrest in Libya ,_,  Mali ,_,  and the Central African Republic and have reportedly also spread into Niger ,_,  Chad ,_,  and Cameroon ._. 
On top of this ,_,  Clapper recently reported that Chad ,_,  Niger ,_,  Mali ,_,  and Mauritania were endangered by their support of the French -_: led effort in Mali and at risk of increased terror attacks as retribution ._. Still ,_,  this seems to have changed little for the director of national intelligence ._. 
Leveraging and partnering with the French is a way to go ,_,  he told Congress last month ._. 
They have insight and understanding and ,_,  importantly ,_,  a willingness to use the forces they have there now ._. France has indeed exhibited a longstanding willingness to use military force in Africa ,_,  but what insight and understanding its officials gleaned from this experience is an open question ._. 
One hundred and sixteen years after it completed its conquest of what was then French Sudan ,_,  France's forces are again fighting and dying on the same fields of battle ,_,  though today the country is called Mali ._. 
Again and again during the early 20th century ,_,  France launched military expeditions ,_,  including during the 1928 -_: 1931 Kongo -_: Wara rebellion ,_,  against indigenous peoples in French Equatorial Africa ._. 
Today ,_,  France's soldiers are being killed on the same ground in what's now known as the Central African Republic ._. 
And it looks as if they may be slogging on in these nations ,_,  in partnership with the U ._. S ._.  military ,_,  for years to come ,_,  with no evident ability to achieve lasting results ._. A new type of expeditionary warfare is underway in Africa ,_,  but there's little to suggest that America's backing of a former colonial power will ultimately yield the long -_: term successes that years of support for local proxies could not ._. 
So far ,_,  the U ._. S ._.  has been willing to let European and African forces do the fighting ,_,  but if these interventions drag on and the violence continues to leap from country to country as yet more militant groups morph and multiply ,_,  the risk only rises of Washington wading ever deeper into post -_: colonial wars with an eerily colonial look ._. 
Leveraging and partnering with the French is the current way to go ,_,  according to Washington ._. 
Just where it's going is the real question ._. �THE VIEWS OF THE ABOVE ARTICLE ARE THOSE OF THE AUTHOR/S AND DO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE VIEWS OF THE PAMBAZUKA NEWS EDITORIAL TEAM

Department of State Daily Press BriefingEgyptMS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Oh ,_,  how nice of you ,_,  Arshad ._. 
Two things for all of you at the top ._. 
The United States is deeply troubled by the decision today of an Egyptian court to uphold an on -_: appeal three -_: year prison sentences and substantial fines for Mohamed Adel ,_,  Ahmed Douma ,_,  and Ahmed Maher  -_:  three peaceful ,_,  pro -_: democracy activists ._. 
Their continued imprisonment under a law that severely restricts the universal right to peaceful assembly and expression runs counter the Egyptian Government's commitment to fostering an open electoral environment and a transition process that protects the universal rights of all Egyptians ._. 
We urge the Egyptian Government to exercise its constitutional authority to commute these excessive sentences ,_,  which are not in line with the rights guaranteed in Egypt's new constitution ,_,  Egypt's international obligations ,_,  or the government's own commitment not to return to Mubarak -_: era practices ._. South SudanQUESTION :_:  The Secretary meets with the South Sudanese foreign minister this week ._. 
While you were traveling ,_,  there was an announcement of sanctions in South Sudan ._. 
Have there been any individuals associated with those sanctions ,_,  and is the message  -_:  that part of the message to the South Sudanese foreign minister this weekMS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  I'm certain that will be part of the discussion ._. 
I'm not aware of individuals tied to it but  -_:  yet ._. 
But let me talk to our team and see if there's an update ._. 
I know that was last week ,_,  if I remember correctly ._. NigeriaQUESTION :_:  In Nigeria ,_,  there are members of the military who have come forward with evidence that the Nigerian military itself is coordinating attacks with Boko Haram ._. MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Mm -_: hmm ._. QUESTION :_:  Is the United States aware of these reports Does the United States have any independent analysis of collusion between the Nigerian military and Boko Haram How does that affect your helping the Nigerian military with what you thought was a fight against Boko HaramMS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Well ,_,  let me check ,_,  Scott ,_,  with our team ._. 
I haven't had a chance to talk with them about this issue this morning  -_:  or this afternoon ._. EgyptQUESTION :_:  I have a quick one on Egypt ._. MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Go ahead ,_,  Said ._. QUESTION :_:  You started at the very top ._. 
How did you make your displeasure known about  -_:  to the Egyptians about Mohammed Adel and Ahmed Maher Did you  -_:  did anyone speak with anyone there ,_,  or just that they  -_:  -_: MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  We have an expansive team on the ground  -_:  -_: QUESTION :_:  Okay ._. MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:   -_:  -_:  so they certainly make their  -_:  our concerns known when that is relevant ._. QUESTION :_:  Same topic ,_,  sort ofMS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Okay ._. QUESTION :_:  Today is 100 days since the Al Jazeera English journalists  -_:  -_: MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Mm -_: hmm ._. QUESTION :_:   -_:  -_:  have been in captivity ._. 
I'm just wondering if you guys are  -_:  -_: MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Sure ._. QUESTION :_:   -_:  -_:  in touch at all with the Egyptians on that ._. MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Well ,_,  we are ,_,  of course ,_,  watching closely the trial and continue to convey our deep concerns directly to the Government of Egypt ._. 
We urge the government to drop these charges and release these journalists who have been detained ._. 
We remain deeply concerned about the restrictions of freedom of expression in Egypt ,_,  including the targeting of Egyptian and foreign journalists simply for expressing their views ._. 
Journalists ,_,  regardless of affiliation ,_,  should be protected and permitted to do their jobs free from intimidation or fear of retribution ._. 
Egypt's constitution upholds these basic rights and freedoms ,_,  and Egypt's interim government has a responsibility to ensure that they are protected ._. QUESTION :_:  Thank you ._. MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Thank you ._. QUESTION :_:  One more on the Egypt thing ._. MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Sure ._. QUESTION :_:  Had you  -_:  I know you had previously urged the Egyptian authorities to reconsider the sentences on those three ._. MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Mm -_: hmm ._. QUESTION :_:  Had you previously urged them to commute themMS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  I'd have to check on that ,_,  Arshad ,_,  and see what language we'd used previously ._. QUESTION :_:  Because the  -_:  I mean ,_,  I can check too ,_,  but the reason I ask is I think there's one more legal appeal that is still possible ._. MS ._. 
PSAKI :_:  Mm -_: hmm ._. 
Yeah ._. QUESTION :_:  And if you didn't ask them to commute it before ,_,  it suggests you've just given up on the legal process entirely ,_,  or on the court process ._. MS ._. 
Let me check with our team and see on that ._. 
Lagos � THE Army says it is on high alert to curb possible terror attacks the Boko Haram sect is planning to carry out in Ogun State ,_,  southwest of the country ._. Addressing soldiers in Abeokuta ,_,  General Officer Commanding 81 division of Nigerian Army ,_,  Lagos ,_,  Major -_: General Tamunomieibi Dibi ,_,  said the possibility of Boko Haram attack on the state was very likely ._. The army leader however assured that the Nigerian Army had what it took to foil the Boko Haram insurgency and its attacks ._. He charged the soldiers and other security agencies to be watchful and on the alert every time to crush any attacks ._. Dibi urged the military men to be security -_: conscious and report any security -_: threatening information to the appropriate quarters for quick and necessary action ._. �Security watch and consciousness should be seen as everybody business ,_, � Dibi said ._. The army arrested 41 Boko Haram members in the state in January following a raid of notorious areas in the region ._. Dibi said the recent arrest pointed to possible attacks by the Islamic militant group ._. 
After months of emergency rule and military operations in Nigeria's north -_: east ,_,  a few weeks ago Boko Haram launched a comprehensive and audacious assault on Maiduguri ,_,  the capital of Borno state ._. In a multi -_: pronged attack ,_,  hundreds of insurgents reportedly targeted the city's military barracks ,_,  Maiduguri University ,_,  and an area where civil servants are known to live ._. In its temerity and scale the attack is reminiscent of the Taliban's notorious 2012 assault on Kabul ._. 
It proves what many of us already suspected  -_:  that the state of emergency imposed last spring and the deployment of thousands of troops since then have done nothing to weaken Boko Haram ._. 
They are alive and well ._. This attack has been in the making for a few weeks ._. 
More than 1 ,_, 300 people have been killed in the last two months as the insurgents have ramped up the violence ._. They've been daring and brutal ,_,  attacking villages all around Maiduguri ._. 
Most often the military are not there to protect people ._. 
When they are there ,_,  they often run away ._. 
And it routinely takes them hours to respond to any attack in full force ._. But the problem isn't just the military's fighting performance ._. 
The security forces are accused of arbitrarily rounding up young men on the streets and shooting them ._. 
Amnesty International has long accused the security forces of burning homes and carrying out summary executions in response to attacks ._. Their most recent report claimed police are presiding over hundreds of deaths in detention ._. 
These tactics are entirely counter -_: productive ._. They strengthen the insurgency by alienating people and pushing them into the hands of Boko Haram  -_:  as sympathisers and recruits ._. 
In fact ,_,  if this conduct is routine ,_,  it is very possible that the extra troop deployments have made things worse rather than better ._. How can Nigeria turn this around There needs to be nothing short of a revolution in strategy and capabilities ._. Improving capabilities should firstly be about training ._. 
It is quite clear that the army is not properly trained to carry out a counter -_: insurgency campaign ._. They are still being trained as if they were fighting a conventional war ._. 
But 95 percent of the time counter -_: insurgency doesn't involve shooting at anyone ._. 
It involves denying insurgents space and support by providing reliable security and winning the confidence of local people ._. 
No soldiers should be sent north unless they know how to do this ._. It's also about numbers ._. 
Counter -_: insurgencies require large numbers of troops because ,_,  unlike the insurgents ,_,  you have to hold territory and protect the population ._. Nigeria should try and recruit some of the extra troops from the north ,_,  specifically from the Kanuri ethnic group where the insurgency is said to have most of its support ._. 
Kanuri soldiers will be more trusted by the local population and will be less likely to commit human rights violations ._. 
The downside is the risk of infiltration ._. The army will have to understand the importance of vetting from the very beginning ,_,  and should work through trusted local leaders to recruit ._. 
Elsewhere ,_,  they should try and recruit more from groups with whom the Kanuri have not historically had poor relations ._. To boost both skills and numbers ,_,  Nigeria is going to need outside help ._. 
They will need Western advisors to help train the troops in counter -_: insurgency tactics ,_,  and they will probably need Western funding too ._. 
European countries and the USA should start thinking about a counter -_: terrorism assistance package ._. The problem is they will rightly be concerned about supporting an army that has been accused of so many human rights violations ._. 
That's why they should insist on accountability for human rights violations ._. 
And they should also ensure that the training instils the need to respect human rights and protect the population right through the ranks ._. Most critically ,_,  the strategy must change ._. 
Insurgents are only able to succeed when they have some support amongst the local population ._. Since they do not have the capacity to win a conventional war involving constant battles out in the open ,_,  they must be able to hide themselves and their equipment from the army in between surprise attacks ._. 
They must also recruit people into their ranks ._. 
Both of these require some level of local support ._. 
Boko Haram certainly has this ,_,  as the New York Times has reported ._. The only way to defeat an insurgency is to drain it of this support ._. 
The battle ,_,  then ,_,  is primarily political rather than military ._. 
Put simply ,_,  you've got to make a better offer to the people than the insurgents can ._. 
You've got to encourage them to turn the insurgents in rather than shelter and join them ._. How do you do this The first step is to understand ._. 
Who are Boko Haram Who might be sympathetic to them and why How much support do they have and from which particular areas and villages These questions need answers ._. 
There is an impressive amount of data out there about what Afghans think ,_,  for example ,_,  about the Taliban ,_,  NATO forces ,_,  and the Afghan government ._. There has also been a lot of effort put into identifying exactly who the Taliban are  -_:  where they come from and what they want ._. 
Naturally ,_,  a complex picture emerges of an insurgency with various different elements and motivations ,_,  and supporters with varying levels of sympathy and reasons for sympathising ._. There is undoubtedly a similar picture in north -_: east Nigeria waiting to be discovered ,_,  documented ,_,  and used for counter -_: insurgency purposes ._. The second step is knowing what not to do ._. 
In general ,_,  heavy -_: handed tactics and human rights violations make things worse because they alienate civilians and increase sympathy for the enemy ._. 
Corruption is also highly alienating ._. 
These should be obvious points ,_,  but little progress seems to have been made on either front ._. The government should start by adopting a zero tolerance policy on both ,_,  and announcing prosecutions for past crimes ._. The Nigerian courts do not have the capacity to put every human rights violator or corrupt official on trial ,_,  so they'll have to hope that a few high -_: profile ,_,  well publicised prosecutions are sufficient as a deterrent ._. All security forces should be given anti -_: corruption training ,_,  as well as human rights training ._. 
They should also be trained to avoid methods of fighting that are likely to accidentally kill civilians ._. Finally you've got to know what proactive actions to take ._. 
Most importantly ,_,  you must provide security ._. 
Insecurity will undermine confidence in the state and encourage people to look for alternative sources of authority and protection ._. The number one focus of the counter -_: insurgency effort should be to protect the population ._. 
This is far more important than pro -_: actively searching for insurgents and killing them ,_,  which can even be counter -_: productive ._. On a tactical level ,_,  it makes more sense to deploy small numbers of troops into different villages than to keep them all inside bases ._. 
They will be more able to respond to attacks and protect the population ._. You may think these troops would invite attacks on themselves and the villages they inhabit ,_,  but experience in Afghanistan counter -_: intuitively suggests attacks on small groups are actually much less likely than attacks on large bases ._. Smaller groups of soldiers deployed in villages will be able to develop relationships with villagers ,_,  gather intelligence ,_,  and deny the insurgents military and political space ._. 
This will be vital in defeating the insurgency ._. But it shouldn't be done unless the troops are well trained ._. 
If and when they are attacked ,_,  they'll be far away from help ._. 
They're also more likely to commit human rights violations if they're living with villagers ._. 
So the soldiers that do this will have to be better at fighting and more respectful of the population than average troops ._. In Afghanistan ,_,  NATO soldiers were specially trained for 'village stability operations' ._. 
These were very effective in improving security ,_,  as demonstrated by several case studies ._. 
Nigeria should consider creating a special force for similar operations ._. It's also a good idea to work with local people ._. 
They will be trusted more by civilians and are less likely to commit human rights violations ._. 
Borno state's civilian JTF initiative ,_,  championed by Governor Shettima ,_,  is a good model that could be rolled out across the three embattled states ._. The potential pitfalls are that paramilitaries may be more interested in using weapons to settle local disputes than to protect people from Boko Haram ,_,  and that they may attract more attacks on the civilian population ._. 
Alarmingly ,_,  there have been reports of Boko Haram killing civilians after accusing them of being in the civilian JTF ._. The way to get round the first problem is to ensure local dynamics are fully understood before equipping a paramilitary force ._. 
If it seems likely they will use their weapons to simply attack another village ,_,  it's best to avoid arming them ._. It will also be important to train them and ensure they are accountable both to the state and to the communities they serve ._. 
Indeed ,_,  Governor Shettima has gone to great lengths to train the civilian JTF ._. As for whether they invite attacks on civilians ,_,  the government will have to make a judgement as to whether this risk is outweighed by the benefits ._. 
I would argue it is ,_,  especially as the civilian JTF are credited with pushing Boko Haram out of Maiduguri last year  -_:  something the army were unable to achieve ._. Economic development is also key ._. 
Governor Shettima has spoken of the need for a 'Marshall Plan' for the north ._. 
It is desperately needed ._. 
In the north of the country ,_,  72% of people live in poverty ,_,  compared with 27% in the south ._. Poverty and lack of opportunities make it easy for Boko Haram to attract recruits and sympathisers ._. 
The government should also provide better services for local people ._. 
Insurgencies thrive when they are able to step in as service providers ,_,  which is what Boko Haram originally did ._. Development will not be a quick fix ._. 
We are talking about a generational change ._. 
But it is vital that Nigeria starts now ._. 
Western governments and institutions should step in to help ._. This includes the World Bank ,_,  which is now focusing on conflict affected states ._. 
But a return to insisting on structural adjustment ,_,  which limits the government's role as a service provider ,_,  would be unwise ._. Another ingredient is the narrative ._. 
A successful counter -_: insurgency must create favourable political dividing lines between government forces and the insurgents ._. In theory ,_,  Boko Haram does not make it difficult to do this ._. 
They primarily kill Muslim civilians and are responsible for disorder and violence ._. The government has the opportunity to portray itself as a champion of security and development ._. 
But as long as troops continue to be ineffective and commit human rights violations ,_,  and as long as the poverty rate remains high ,_,  this will be difficult ._. Nigeria can win this war ,_,  but they need to start turning it around now ._. 
The north needs economic development on a massive scale; it needs well -_: trained troops working with reliable local volunteers ,_,  and a visible security presence even in remote areas ._. And all of this needs to be packaged into a convincing narrative that can deliver that vital political victory ._. 
Without this ,_,  we can only expect things to get worse ._. Andrew Noakes is a human rights activist and freelance journalist covering Africa ._. 
A monthly Daily Trust online poll has shown that most Nigerians are dissatisfied with the current efforts of the Federal Government in stemming the violence that has rocked the North -_: Eastern part of the country for close to two years now ._. A handful of the respondents equally believe the use of military force is a sure way to curb the excesses of the insurgents ._. In the latest poll ,_,  out of a total of two thousand one hundred and twenty seven 2 ,_, 127 respondents ,_,  over 50 percent of responses agreed that the present efforts by the government in fighting insurgency and protecting lives and properties especially in the north eastern states of Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa was insufficient ._. While about 10 percent of respondents praised the government's intervention efforts ,_,  a further 32 percent split into two equal halves on the one hand says the use of force is the best way to end the insurgency and dialogue with the terrorist group remains the best option on the other hand ._. In May 2013 ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan had declared a state of emergency in three Nigerian states of Adamawa ,_,  Yobe and Borno ._. 
He made the declaration during a nationwide broadcast aired live on television ._. The activities of insurgents and terrorists have been reprehensible ,_,  causing fear among our citizens and a near -_: breakdown of law and order in parts of the country ,_,  especially the North ._. 
We have taken robust steps to unravel and address the root causes of these crises ,_,  but it would appear that there is a systematic effort by insurgents and terrorists to destabilize the Nigerian state and test our collective resolve were Jonathan's words on why a state of emergency had to be declared in those states ._. But over the last few months after the emergency rule was declared ,_,  the frequency of terrorist attacks seem to have scaled up ,_,  with the terrorists becoming more daring with every attack ._. 
Maiduguri � Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima yesterday condemned the allegation of collaboration between the Boko Haram and some sections of the nation's military ,_,  describing such allegation as unfair ,_,  reprehensible and dangerous to the survival of the nation at the current phase of counter insurgency operations ._. The governor was reacting to media reports which quoted an unnamed soldier as saying that some military commanders were working with Boko Haram elements ._. 
An unknown soldier had made the allegation in an interview on VOA Hausa Service radio ._. But Shettima in a statement yesterday debunked the claim ,_,  saying insurgents would do everything to cause confusion and manipulate people into distrust as citizens and establishments ,_,  saying ,_,  let's not fall into their trap ,_,  lose focus and become their mass victims ._. Of all theories being linked to Boko Haram ,_,  the most dangerous as far as I'm concerned is to raise such grievous suspicion around our security forces ._. 
When citizens grow such suspicion and believe in it ,_,  I'm afraid ,_,  Boko Haram can light fireworks to celebrate a grand victory of setting up citizens against the security agencies ._. 
Since last week ,_,  I have listened to and read these media reports with the hope that the issue will not get out of hand but it appears the matter is growing and I find it very disturbing ._. 
I do not want to bother about the credibility or otherwise of the soldier in question ._. 
I'm sure the security forces take this allegation seriously and they are investigating it as they should ._. 
I am not holding brief for the armed forces but as governor of Borno State  ,_, whose area is unfortunately the worst hit ,_,  who has been closely working with security agencies ,_,  I would rather encourage confidence building between citizens and the armed forces so that intelligence sharing can rise continually and we don't lose focus in the counter insurgency ,_,  he said ._. The governor noted that the day citizens become suspicious of security agencies as collaborators with insurgents the nation would drift towards chaos ._. We cannot afford that unhealthy development ._. 
Unless it becomes unquestionably evident ,_,  we must work as individuals ,_,  groups and institutions to promote public trust in our armed forces to encourage cordiality between citizens and security agencies ._. 
We must recognize that at the moment ,_,  the security agencies are all we've got ,_,  we should preserve their integrity by at least giving them the benefit of doubt ,_,  he added ._. 
The Chairman of the National Conference ,_,  Idris Kutigi ,_,  and Lagos -_: based pastor ,_,  Tunde Bakare ,_,  again clashed over the use of religious recitation during Tuesday's plenary session ._. Mr ._. 
Kutigi had on March 18 recited a Muslim prayer ,_,  Bismi -_: llhir -_: ramni r -_: ram ,_,  meaning ,_,  In the Name of God ,_,  the Most Gracious ,_,  and the Most Merciful ,_,  before declaring the day's proceeding open ._. But Mr ._. 
Bakare raised objection against the use of the recitation ,_,  insisting that delegates must stick to the language used in conducting proceedings ._. He referred to the Bible where Apostle Paul admonished Christians who speak in other tongues to interpret such tongues in order not to confuse their listeners ._. During that sitting ,_,  the Chairman had agreed and even ruled that only English language would be used throughout the duration of the Conference ._. However ,_,  Mr ._. 
Kutigi ignored the rule when he opened Tuesday's plenary sitting with the Islamic prayer for God's guidance ,_,  a situation which made Mr ._. 
Bakare again to raise a point of order ._. Mr ._. 
Bakare said ,_,  I have never seen you laugh like you have done in this Conference ._. 
I pray that you laugh last and live long for all of us ._. 
The Rules of the Proceedings of this Conference says everything will be conducted in English language ._. On the 18th of March ,_,  I made some observations and one of them was what you said in your opening remarks ._. 
I want to make an addendum to that ._. In a bid to build bridges and not war ,_,  Mr ._. 
Odumakin had raised the same objection and the deputy chairman overruled ._. Sir ,_,  I have since realised that it is not intimidation on your path ._. 
It is just your way of opening the Conference ._. 
When my brother representing the Islamic Council finished his speech ,_,  I went there to embrace him for building bridges ._. 
I also went to the Lamido of Adamawa to ask him for my own passport to Cameroon in case there is trouble ._. Mr ._. 
Chairman ,_,  let us speak the language that everyone understands ._. 
Let us stick to what somebody did yesterday when he said 'In the name of God ,_,  the Most Gracious ,_,  and the Most Merciful ._. 'That way ,_,  we know that it is a prayer coming from the heart ._. 
In the holy book that I read ,_,  Apostle Paul said 'He who speaks in an unknown tongue must interpret so that others can understand ._. 'When Mr ._. 
Bakare's point of order was completely ignored by Mr ._. 
Kutigi ,_,  who went ahead to recognise the next speaker ,_,  other delegates murmured at the action ._. Another clash was averted at the Conference when delegates shouted down the North -_: East delegate ,_,  Ibrahim Bunu ,_,  while presenting a paper on the growing insurgency in the North ._. Trouble started when Mr ._. 
Kutigi permitted Mr ._. 
Bunu to present the paper on the floor but was shouted down by other delegates barely two minutes after he started speaking ._. Mr ._. 
Bunu had said ,_,  I have listened to a number of comments about the insecurity in the North -_: East ,_,  particularly the Boko Haram insurgents ._. I have a document of the happenings in the North -_: East which was prepared by Borno Elders ._. The document contains what has been happening in Borno state ._. 
If you will permit me ,_,  let me quickly read it out to you so that you can understand ._. 
As Mr ._. 
Bunu was speaking ,_,  another delegate ,_,  Anayo Nembe ,_,  representing former speakers' forum argued that other delegates had their papers to present about the goings on in their respective areas ._. Mr ._. 
Nember argued that allowing Mr ._. 
Bunu to read the report will amount to a waste of time since every part of the country has similar report to present before the Conference ._. Mr ._. 
Nembe said :_:  Let him photocopy the documents and circulate to delegates ._. 
We all have our different documents to present about what is happening in our areas ._. 
We cannot sit here and be wasting time ._. 
He should not waste our time ._. 
Make photocopies and circulate ._. When the Conference resumed debate on President Goodluck Jonathan's address ,_,  the tension dissolved and delegates again paid attention to the plenary ._. In his contribution ,_,  the National Chairman of the Labour Party ,_,  Dan Nwuanyanwu ,_,  identified corruption ,_,  tribalism and religion as common enemies of Nigeria ._. Mr ._. 
Nwuanyanwu said :_:  I will start by asking a question ._. 
Are we cursed or we are the cause I am asking Nigerians the same question ._. 
We are the cause ._. 
We do not love one another in this country ._. 
We do not even give contracts to people who are not of our tribe ._. 
We must address this problem of regions and religion ._. We cannot pretend as if we are not aware of it ._. 
Nigerians abroad will never come home because of the way things are run here ._. If they come here ,_,  they will be kidnapped or killed or not even allowed to work because of his tribe and religion ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  we do not go to war with our best 11 players ._. Mr ._. 
Nwuanyanwu advocated death penalty for corrupt public office holders ,_,  saying it was the only remedy for curbing corruption in the country ._. The former Governor of Anambra state ,_,  Jim Nwobodo ,_,  compared Nigeria's presidential system to that of the United States ,_,  but argued that the demerits of the system were more than its merits ._. The former governor said ,_,  The only country that practices the presidential system in the world like the Americans are Nigerians ._. 
The system has its merits and demerits ._. 
The demerits outweigh its merits ._. For me ,_,  religion is not an issue in Nigeria ._. 
It is a creation of those who want to rule forever ._. 
I see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today ._. 
Let us replicate what the youth have done for us ._. 
They have made us proud in many ways ._. A former Minister of Health ,_,  ABC Nwosu spoke in a similar vein ._. He said the control of excessive power by the central government remains one of the reasons why the country is not making significant progress and called for the devolution of power to zones and states ._. In devolving powers ,_,  we have to sharply define federating units ._. 
I recommend the zones ,_,  Mr ._. 
Nwosu said ._. 
As April 19 ,_,  the last day for the ongoing state of emergency rule in the northeast states of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe due to the unending terror attacks approaches ,_,  the military yesterday noted that it was always impossible to predict the end to any operation against terrorism or insurgency ._. The military has been dispatching troops to the three states with a view to stopping the insurgency by the Boko Haram Islamists ,_,  but from all indications ,_,  the counter -_: insurgent operations ,_,  according to the Chief of Air Staff ,_,  Air Marshal Adesola Amosu ,_,  would go beyond April 19 ._. Addressing Defence Correspondents in his office on the 50th anniversary of the Nigerian Air Force ,_,  Air Marshal Amosu explained that the complexity of the operations against terrorism anywhere in the world makes it difficult to predict when it would end ._. He ,_,  however ,_,  gave the assurance that the elusive peace would have been restored before February 2015 to ensure that the general election holds there ._. He said ,_,  Don't forget that in the fight against terrorism and the insurgency ,_,  there are about four aspects involved :_:  you have the issue of the counter -_:  and the anti -_:  ,_,  the issue political intervention and economic situation ._. 
But the first is that if there is no peace ,_,  the only thing you can do is the anti  -_:  you can go ahead with the counter -_:  and the anti  -_:  terrorism ._. The aspect of introducing the economic activities is almost suspended if the peace is not there ._. 
There are variables that would prevent you from achieving your target date ._. But for terrorism and insurgency ,_,  you definitely cannot have a target date ._. 
Even if you have put everything under control ,_,  you may still have sporadic attacks ,_,  a well  -_: planned organised attack ,_,  one or two of these terrorists may show up with AK 47 rifles ._. 
Even if it is one or two shots he fired ,_,  you know that is a terrorist attack ,_,  so ,_,  it is difficult to give a date ,_,  but I want to assure you we would continue working hard to ensure that we bring the entire situation under control ._. 
The military yesterday alleged that the herdsmen that have been killing innocent people in some states in the north are targeting Abuja ,_,  the seat of the government ,_,  and cautions the populace against identifying with them ._. The herdsmen ,_,  who have been operating under the cover of the night ,_,  according to the military ,_,  were hired by some unscrupulous faceless people to unleash terror on the populace ._. The terrorists have killed about 2 ,_,  000 innocent people in the last few weeks ._. The military has been dispatching troops to Benue ,_,  Nasarawa and Plateau states at the directive of President Goodluck Jonathan ._. Some top officers that were sent to Benue on fact -_: finding mission were said to have written a damning report that showed that the herdsmen were coming into the country from the neighbouring countries to attack ,_,  kill and destroy ._. The report ,_,  according to a top officer of the Defence Headquarters ,_,  also revealed that the herdsmen are planning to launch some sporadic attacks on the federal capital ._. 
Speaking with LEADERSHIP ,_,  a senior military officer quoted excerpts from the report but promised that the military is up to the task of stopping them from entering Abuja ._. He said :_:  It is a pity some people who do not understand the agenda of these criminals pretending to be Fulani herdsmen are identifying with them and attacking the military for dealing with them ._. 
These hoodlums ,_,  we believe ,_,  were hired by some faceless people in the country from the neighbouring countries ._. 
They have attacked Adamawa ,_,  Taraba ,_,  Benue ,_,  Nasarawa states ,_,  and you would know that Nasarawa is the closest state to Abuja ._. Already they have some camps in Kogi ,_,  Niger ,_,  and Kaduna states ._. 
Some of them are said to be living inside one big forest in Niger State ._. 
All these states surround the Federal Capital Territory ._. 
Their mission in those states is to displace the indigenes ,_,  take over their land and pretend to be taking care of their cattle ._. 
They have already done that in Benue State where two local government councils were sacked; most of the towns and villages there were razed down; many were killed and these forced those who survived their attacks to relocate ._. These herdsmen were coming from the neighbouring Nasarawa State ._. 
We saw some of them with their cattle grazing in the two local governments where their people have run away and they pretend as if nothing unusual has happened ._. 
In one of the villages they razed down ,_,  they used marker to write 'Nasarawa State' as if they were doing annexation ._. 
Once they settled down in all these states ,_,  their next move is Abuja ,_,  but this we would not allow ,_,  no matter the propaganda being used against the military ._. Military faults NHRC reportAlso ,_,  the military has faulted the National Human Rights Commission NHRC report which indicted the Nigerian Army and the Department of State Services DSS for their role in the killing of eight people in the Apo District of the Federal Capital Territory on September 20 ,_,  last year ._. The commission ,_,  through its chairman ,_,  Professor Chidi Odinkalu ,_,  said the Army and the DSS failed to prove that the eight persons killed and 11 others injured due to an attack launched by the security operatives in Apo were members of Boko Haram ._. Distress call saves community as troops continue onslaught on terroristsThe Defence Headquarters yesterday said it was a timely distress call that saved communities besieged by terrorists in search of food around the Lake Chad area ._. The terrorists who were said to be heavily armed scampered for safety on sensing the approach of troops before they could carry out their mission ._. According to a statement issued in Abuja and signed by the Defence spokesman ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade ,_,  the troops of the Multi -_: National Joint Task Force on patrol of the area have so far recovered some arms and ammunition left behind by the fleeing terrorists ._. 10 killed ,_,  15 injured in WukariOver 10 people were yesterday reportedly killed ,_,  15 injured and 20 houses burnt down in Jibu village in Wukari local government area of Taraba State ._. 
A resident of the village ,_,  Mr Dan Anguyo ,_,  told LEADERSHIP at Wukari that the armed men identified to be Jukums numbering over 39 invaded the village in the early hours of yesterday shooting people and burning houses ._. Anguyo ,_,  who said he narrowly escaped the attack ,_,  also confirmed to LEADERSHIP that nobody knows the actual reasons behind the attack on the innocent people ._. When contacted ,_,  the spokesman of the state police command ,_,  ASP Joseph Kwaji ,_,  noted that the command had quickly drafted more of its men to the affected area to bring the ugly situation under control while investigation into the matter continued ._. Zamfara massacre :_:  Reps summon IGP ,_,  Gusau ,_,  NSAWorried about the death of over 200 people in the hands of gunmen in Maru and Zurmi local government areas of Zamfara State ,_,  the House of Representatives has invited the minister of defence ,_,  Gen ._. 
Aliyu Gusau rtd ,_,  and the inspector -_: general of police ,_,  Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar ,_,  to appear before its committee on national security to shed light on the killings  ._. The decision was taken yesterday during plenary ,_,  following the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance moved by Hon ._. 
Ibrahim Gusau PDP ,_,  Zamfara ._. The lawmakers also directed the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA to immediately deliver relief materials to the distressed citizens of the affected communities ._. Leading debate on the motion ,_,  Gusau called the attention of his colleagues to the April 3 ,_,  2014 ,_,  killings where over 30 people were ambushed and killed in the towns of Yar -_: Tsaba and Birnin -_: Tsaba in Zurmi local government area ._. 
He went further to add that ,_,  on the April 5 ,_,  over 200 innocent citizens were mercilessly killed in Yar -_: Galadima village by people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen ._. He went further to inform the lawmakers that the gunmen who numbered over 100 operated freely for about four hours shooting at children ,_,  traders ,_,  vigilante ,_,  community leaders and clerics ._. The incidents ,_,  Gusau lamented ,_,  has led to fear among residents of many villages in the affected areas over a repeat of the attacks ._. 
According to him ,_,  this had led to many fleeing their homes ._. The Fulani herdsmen have gradually become more daring ,_,  well organized and well -_: armed that no small units of security personnel can repel their attacks when they strike ._. These groups of attackers are becoming more coordinated and if not quickly terminated can turn into yet another organized terror group which can pose additional dimension to the security challenges in the country ._. The above gruesome statistics were for Zamfara State alone ._. 
Similar incidents have been recurring in Benue and Nasarawa states where several people were killed ,_,  he said ._. Meanwhile ,_,  the House has advised the federal government to construct a military barracks in Doma ,_,  headquarters of Doma local government area of Nasarawa State ,_,  to accommodate a battalion to boost security in the southern senatorial district of the state where there have been a series of attacks in recent times ._. While adopting the resolution which was sequel to a motion of urgent national importance sponsored by Hon ._. 
Mohammed Onawo PDP yesterday ,_,  the House also mandated its committees on Works and Army to ascertain why the project was not executed ._. Needless killings must stop  -_:  MarkSenate president David Mark has lamented the incessant killings in the north -_: central and north -_: east regions of the country ,_,  saying these needless killings must stop ._. The Senate president made this plea after a point of order raised by Senator Kabir Marafa on the recent massacre in Zamfara ._. If there is any birthday gift that I would want ,_,  it is for us to end these needless and senseless deaths that we have in the country today ._. We wake every day and we hear of people being killed ._. 
First it was single unit  -_:  -_:  two ,_,  three people died; then tens ,_,  now hundreds ,_,  and we don't want it to go beyond this ,_,  and I hope and pray that all Nigerians will ensure that we bring these needless deaths to an end ,_,  he said ._. Nasarawa killings :_:  Fulani threatens to drag FG to criminal courtThe Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association ,_,  the socio cultural group of Fulanis ,_,  have threatened to drag the Nigerian government before the International Criminal Court over the killings of Fulani herdsmen by the Nigerian military in Nasarawa State ._. Though the military authorities said those killed were insurgents who have terrorised farmers in Nasarawa and Benue states ,_,  the association said those killed were innocent Fulani ,_,  alleging that there is grand plot to eliminate the Fulani from Nigeria ._. Addressing the press in Abuja ,_,  the Nasarawa State secretary of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association ,_,  Alhaji Mohammed Husseini ,_,  urged the government to tender a public apology and pay compensation to the families of those killed by soldiers ._. He said ,_,  Our people were killed in their houses which they have inhabited for over 30 years without committing any crime ._. 
We are convinced beyond reasonable doubt there is a grand plot to eliminate the Fulani from Nigeria ._. 
Otherwise there is no reason why a people will continue to be killed in their houses by government troops who are supposed to protect them ._. This time around we cannot keep quiet ,_,  even if it means going to the International Criminal Court ,_,  because what is being done to us amounts to genocide and ethnic cleansing ._. He said direct confrontation will never solve the issue ,_,  stressing that the Fulanis are open to positive dialogue that will resolve the issues ._. He said though there may be bad eggs amongst the Fulanis the primary responsibility of the government is to fish out the bad eggs and there are standard procedures for doing that ._. He warned that the approach by applied by the government may degenerate into a dangerous situation that will be very difficult to handle ._. Village head ,_,  10 others killed in BornoSuspected Boko Haram militants ,_,  in the early hours of yesterday ,_,  stormed Takulari village ,_,  in restive Chibok local government area of Borno State ,_,  killing 11 people and setting several houses alight ._. The residents told the Hausa service of the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC that a village head and several others were killed in the attack ._. 
On Sunday March 30 ,_,  2014 ,_,  about 21 persons suspected of belonging to the Boko Haram sect were killed and many others wounded during a reported jailbreak at the Asokoro headquarters of the Department of State Security in Abuja ._. The official account of the incident as reported in the media is that a detainee struck an operative who had brought breakfast with his handcuff ._. 
The report did not say whether the handcuff had been locked around the detainee's wrist or had been unlocked ._. 
It did not say the extent to which the action of the detainee threatened the life or safety of the operative ,_,  and whether the detainee succeeded in dispossessing the operative of his weapon if s/he carried one ._. 
The statement further said that bullets were fired at the detainee ,_,  but did not say what other detainees did to deserve being fired at or killed ._. 
Some media reports quoted Ms ._. 
Marilyn Ogar ,_,  Deputy Director ,_,  Public Relations ,_,  of the State Security Service ,_,  as saying that  ._.  the attempt by the detainee to escape made other SSS operatives on guard to fire shots to prevent others from escaping ._. A literal interpretation of this statement is that other detainees who posed no danger to the DSS or its operatives ,_,  or ,_,  who ,_,  in fact made no attempt to escape from detention were fired at to prevent them from even contemplating the possibility of fleeing !_. 
Is this what happenedPreventive shooting ,_,  or ,_,  actually ,_,  preventive killing !_. No clear justification has been provided by the DSS or the Nigerian State for the killing of such a multitude of vulnerable detainees ._. 
We pose many questions to the SSS :_:  Where were the detainees when they were fired at Outside of their enclosures or within Within the precincts of the DSS facility or outside At what point were they fired at ,_,  and with what purpose To restrain their flight or to annihilate them Then ,_,  who fired at them The DSS/SSS or the soldiers who came to assist them Were they fired at to avoid political embarrassment Did they all die immediately after the shooting or were injured persons given medical assistance There has been no clear ,_,  forthright ,_,  convincing and consistent statement from the DSS ,_,  SSS or government to justify this massacre ._. Anyone associated with the Boko Haram sect would ordinarily face considerable public prejudice given the horrifying atrocities attributed to the group; yet ,_,  it is this negative perception that renders both them as well as those wrongly associated with them so vulnerable to persecution ,_,  to being silenced ,_,  brutalised or violated capriciously ._. 
The death of anyone associated with this sect must be subject to the toughest scrutiny to avoid people getting away with clear homicides only by the sheer unpopularity of the victims' ascribed label ._. 
And yes :_:  Nigerian law enforcement and security agencies do understand how to leverage on unpopular stereotypes and how little sympathies exist for people associated  -_:  truthfully or falsely  -_:  to reviled groups ._. 
We see this every time ,_,  everywhere ._. 
They abound with the police routinely saying those they extra -_: judicially killed were armed robbers who were trying to flee from the law ,_,  and to refresh our memory with a notorious piece of history ,_,  we recall the Apo 6 ._. 
We see the Joint Task Force JTF saying that those it killed in Baga ,_,  Maiduguri last year were terrorists ,_,  when it fired indiscriminately at unarmed civilians in revenge for the killing of an Army Lieutenant or Lance Corporal ._. 
Our security forces ,_,  overwhelmed by the escalating affront of extremist groups are ,_,  no doubt ,_,  under pressure ,_,  and have repeatedly acted with impunity and committed grave crimes against many innocent people ,_,  in a largely unchallenged way ._. Reports of extra -_: judicial ,_,  summary executions by government forces are clearly intensifying and ,_,  to some extent ,_,  delegitimising what ought to be a credible fight against terrorism ._. 
There is some advocacy to take government forces to the International Criminal Court along with Boko Haram fighters because our government will not rein in wayward ,_,  illegitimate violence meted to innocent victims by its security forces ._. We cannot afford to be quiet when the State kills in circumstances like this ,_,  notwithstanding the extremism and violence of armed groups that has brought much gut -_: wrenching bloodshed and dislocation to our country ._. 
Our answer to extremist depravities cannot mirror and reproduce the brutishness and mindlessness we condemn ,_,  for then ,_,  we can't say we have set a standard by which we are entitled to judge and condemn others ,_,  for we can be no different from those judged ._. 
But more than that ,_,  we run the universal risk of exposing innocent people suffering to the injustice of stigmatisation and victimisation from mislabelling ._. 
That stigmatisation has often led to many deaths ,_,  unfair ,_,  unfortunate deaths ._. 
Nelson Mandela ,_,  that hero of the anti -_: apartheid struggle ,_,  was once branded a terrorist by the White government in Pretoria ._. 
Had he been killed the way the 21 inmates in the custody of the SSS were ,_,  the world would have been denied knowledge of the truth of who Mandela really was ._. 
Who is to say whether all of those persons in SSS custody were actually Boko Haram members in a country where people are picked up randomly and hauled to face fabricated crimes In a country where security agencies are plumbing the depths of incredulity to make distorted claims of their progress in winning the war against terrorismPrisoners and detainees still have the right to life and where there is an attempt to escape detention ,_,  their lives cannot be taken whimsically ,_,  or as a retribution for the attempt to escape detention or cause political embarrassment ._. 
In the context of the location where this escape bid was reportedly launched ,_,  it is untenable to argue that there were no non -_: lethal means of preventing the escapes ._. 
The Nigerian Constitution guarantees the right to life ,_,  and the government is under a constitutional responsibility to thoroughly and impartially investigate the deaths of any persons who die in custody ._. 
Many international norms and instruments obligate Nigeria to undertake credible ,_,  impartial and thorough investigations into the death of any persons who dies in custody ._. 
For example ,_,  Principle No 34 of the United Nations Body of Principles for the Protection All Persons under AnyForm of Detention or Imprisonment provides that :_: Whenever the death or disappearance of a detained or imprisoned person occurs during his detention or imprisonment ,_,  an inquiry into the cause of death or disappearance shall be held by a judicial or other authority ,_,  either on its own motion or at the instance of a member of the family of such a person or any person who has knowledge of the case ._. 
When circumstances so warrant ,_,  such an inquiry shall be held on the same procedural basis whenever the death or disappearance occurs shortly after the termination of the detention or imprisonment ._. The findings of such inquiry or a report thereon shall be made available upon request ._. We also urge the National Human Rights Commission ,_,  by virtue of its statutory mandate ,_,  to undertake a thorough and independent investigation into what actually happened during the jail break and ensure that the truth is not buried under the weight of what is politically expedient for the SSS to claim at this time ._. 
After this investigation ,_,  the commission should refer any matter of human rights violation requiring prosecution to the Attorney General of Federation ._. Otteh and Patrick are Lagos based lawyers with Access to Justice
Gov Babangida Aliyu of Niger on Tuesday urged anti -_: corruption agencies to be more proactive in the fight against corruption in the country ._. Aliyu made the call when he received the members of the Fiscal Responsibility Commission led by the Acting Chairman ,_,  Mr Victor Muruako who paid him a courtesy visit ._. The governor urged them to do more in view of the public perception that the anti -_: corruption agencies were not doing enough to curb corruption in the country ._. Corruption is increasing at an alarming rate ._. 
This calls for a stronger push in fighting the scourge ._. He said the efforts of EFCC ,_,  ICPC and the Fiscal Responsibility Commission had done little to reduce corruption in the country ._. We have EFCC ,_,  we have Fiscal Responsibility Commission and we have ICPC but none of these agencies are doing enough to curb corruption ._. Today ,_,  there is no way you will not see stories in the media about corruption and there is no way court cases about corruption will not be reported by the media any day in the country ,_,  he said ._. He blamed the insurgency in the northern region of the country on the rising rate of corruption ._. In fact ,_,  corruption brought about the Boko Haram insurgency ._. Earlier ,_,  Muruako said the commission had been able to recover N114 billion in operating surplus paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund by ministries ,_,  departments ,_,  agencies and corporations ._. He said Nigeria's economy had demonstrated remarkable resilience in the years since the new fiscal regime under the Fiscal Responsibility Act became operational ._. This is in spite of corruption and reluctance at individual and institutional levels to adopt the culture of transparency and accountability ._. Muruako said 22 states had adopted the fiscal responsibility law ,_,  adding that this was not encouraging enough ._. Total compliance with the Act will guarantee a more stable economy and strengthen the nation's position as a peer leader in the region ._.  NAN
A troop of soldiers in masks stormed the Jimeta Shopping Complex situated in the heart of Yola ,_,  the capital of Adamawa state Tuesday arresting 17 persons suspected to be members of Boko Haram ._. The Shopping Complex with a capacity of 500 shops and stores has been tagged by residents as an enclave for hoodlums following reports of incessant criminal activities in the area ._. Eyewitnesses account said the marked soldiers stormed the Shopping complex at about 1pm and started arresting people they had already targeted to arrest ,_,  including men of the Civilian JTF that are helping the military in their operations against members of Boko Haram ._. 
Yaounde � Officials from Francophone Africa say plummeting customs revenue could lead to severe financial difficulties and slow development ._. 
Cross -_: border trade and the usual taxes it generates have taken a serious hit because of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea ,_,  Boko Haram activities in Nigeria ,_, and the persistent crisis in the Central African Republic ._. The drop in customs revenue ,_,  caused by conflict ,_,  piracy and terrorism ,_,  is a growing problem for governments across West and Central Africa ._. At a meeting this week in Yaounde ,_,  organized by the Global Forum on Transparency ,_,  officials said the Central African Republic has lost nearly all of the $6 million is usually receives from customs dues ._. They said other countries in the region ,_,  such as Gabon ,_,  the Republic of Congo ,_,  Chad ,_,  and Sudan ,_,  have lost up to 40 percent of their customs revenue ._. Some of the loss stems from an increase in illegal or undocumented trade; some of it comes from a loss in trade across borders ,_,  as violence makes travel dangerous or difficult ._. Epeh Nkongho ,_,  who works in surveillance for Cameroon's customs agency ,_,  says governments need to take action or face the loss in revenue and a failure to meet development goals ._. You will hear of threats coming from terrorists acts groups like Boko Haram ._. 
We know of the maritime pirates ._. 
We must make sure that we control our borders to make sure that all this illicit trade does not happen ,_,  said Nkongho ._. He says customs officers need to be empowered to be able to face their new challenges ._. It is really not a matter of arms ,_,  it is a matter of intelligence ._. 
We need to carry on cooperation with the other forces of defense to have information on how they terrorists operate ._. 
Even though we have the arms ,_,  that is not the tactic or the strategy to counter some of this crimes ,_,  he said ._. Cameroon Finance Minister Alamine Ousman Mey says customs departments in Africa should work together to stop terrorist movements from harming their economies ._. He says it is important to improve surveillance ,_,  strategic information sharing and transparency and track down those who decide to disrespect laws and adds that it should be done in a transparent manner ._. The most serious problem raised during this week's meeting in Yaounde is the rise of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea ._. 
Data from the International Maritime Bureau shows about 1 ,_, 000 seafarers and fishermen were attacked by pirates armed with guns or knives in the gulf last year ._. 
Abuja � Erstwhile National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  Alhaji Bamanga Tukur ,_,  declared yesterday that those opposed to President Goodluck Jonathan's re -_: election for second term in 2015 will fail ,_,  saying the President must get to his destination ._. Tukur ,_,  while receiving Niger Delta PDP Youth Movement who paid him a visit in his residence in Abuja ,_,  said ,_,  Nigerians needed Jonathan beyond 2015 for continuity and stability ._. You can't change a captain of ship at the middle of sea and ,_,  therefore ,_,  Jonathan must get to the destination ,_,  he said ._. He said :_:  We must support Jonathan ._. 
It is not Jonathan that killed Umaru ,_,  late President Umaru Yar'Adua ._. 
No ,_,  no ,_,  no ,_,  no ._.  It is God ._. 
In our constitution ,_,  when there is no president ,_,  the vice president takes over ._. God shows ,_,  and understand that it is God that gives power ._. 
So ,_,  He shows you ._. 
Even though you decide to give power ,_,  He will show you who He wants to give that power and the type he wants ._. So ,_,  the idea is to follow ._. 
To follow and continue encouraging what God has showed us so that he can be motivated ,_,  he can be assisted to continue doing what we want ,_,  which he is doing on our behalf ._. 
That is the most important ._. Tukur added that Jonathan had the constitutional right to seek re -_: election for a second term in office for continuity ,_,  adding that we need stability for national growth ._. On insecurity in some parts of the country ,_,  Tukur ,_,  while proferring solutions Boko Haram insurgency ,_,  called for adoption of dialogue and diplomacy approach to deal with the current situation ._. 
Following continued air and land strikes on Boko Haram terrorists in the hills and forests of the North -_: East ,_,  an officer of the Nigerian Army and four soldiers have been killed in an ambush by the terrorists ,_,  while scores of the sect members were killed in the shootout that ensued ._. The death of the soldiers came just as a distress call from indigenes indicating a planned attack ,_,  saved some communities around the Lake Chad Basin from being over run by the terrorists ._. A statement by the Director of Defence Information ,_,  Major -_: General Chris Olukolade ,_,  said :_:  A timely distress call has saved communities besieged by the terrorists in search of food around the Lake Chad area ._. The terrorists ,_,  who were said to be heavily armed ,_,  scampered for safety on sensing the approach of troops ._.

North -_: East before 2015 electionsMeanwhile ,_,  Chief of Air Staff ,_,  Air Marshal Adesola Amosu ,_,  declared yesterday that the military and other security agencies will stabilise the security situation in the North -_: East of the country before the 2015 elections ._. Amosu ,_,  who was briefing the media on the activities lined up to mark the NAF 50th anniversary ,_,  however ,_,  said it was difficult to put a time frame as to when the insurgency and terrorism in the North -_: East can be brought to an end ._. He disclosed that a major event planned to mark the golden jubilee ,_,  which is the biennial air expo scheduled for Kaduna this month ,_,  had been postponed to enable the Air Force focus on eliminating insurgency ,_,  terrorism ,_,  oil theft and securing the nation's borders ._. He said :_:  You are all aware that our nation is no doubt facing unprecedented security challenges ,_,  although ,_,  they are by no means insurmountable ._. 
The Nigerian Air Force has been active and in the fore front of the fight against insurgencyAs a result ,_,  NAF assets and personnel are currently fully deployed in the North -_: East to counter the terrorists' insurgency ._. Similarly ,_,  a percentage of Nigerian Air Force assets are involved with the Joint Task Force in the Niger Delta to stem illegal maritime activities and recently ,_,  we are involved in security activities ,_,  aerial surveillance and intelligence regarding herdsmen/farmers killings in the North Central ._. Main challenge ,_,  state of emergencyOn the war proper ,_,  Amosu said :_:  The main challenge we are facing in the North -_: East is that of the citizens not giving us information ._. This is a war that all Nigerians must partake in ,_,  not necessarily by taking part in the fight but by getting us timely information ._. 
With information we can overcome the challenge in a short space of time ._. Reminded that the state of emergency declared by President Jonathan will end by this April and that some elders from the area are calling for the military to pull out then ,_,  the Air Chief said ,_,  you have to take many variables into consideration ._. In fighting terrorism ,_,  you consider the counter aspect ,_,  the anti -_: aspect ,_,  the political intervention aspect and the economic situational aspect ._. On the recent attack on the NAF base in Maiduguri and destruction of its aircraft ,_,  Amosu said the Air Force was in a position to strike at the terrorists during that attack but held back because of the colossal damage it would have done to the Maiduguri metropolis ._. On the North Central attacks ,_,  he said we are already involved in Benue and around the North Central ._. 
We have sufficient intelligence to ensure that peace is restored ._. Throwing light on allegations that foreign aircraft were seen flying into the North East dropping weapons and other logistics for the insurgents ,_,  Amosu said the allegation was being investigated ,_,  adding our pilots do not sleep ._.

New fighter jetsThe Federal Government has placed orders for the acquisition of new fighter and surveillance aircraft for the Nigerian Air Force to enhance the war against terrorism and insurgency in the North -_: East and the deadly attacks of Fulani herdsman in the North Central area ._. Chief of Air Staff ,_,  Amosu ,_,  who made the disclosure during his briefing ,_,  noted that because of the huge responsibility of also monitoring the nation's borders through air surveillance ,_,  a Forward Operations Base has been established in Sokoto ,_,  which will entail the use of more aircraft ._. Aside the fighter and surveillance aircraft ,_,  Vanguard gathered that more Helicopter Gunships ,_,  like the Mi 35 ,_,  will be acquired because of its precision and accuracy in identifying and taking out enemies ._. 'Religious ,_,  ethnic sentiments'Defence headquarters ,_,  DHQ ,_,  has debunked the accusation by leading Islamic religious body ,_,  Jama'atul Nasril Islamiya ,_,  that the resolve by the Nigerian military and security agencies to rid the North -_: East of Boko Haram terrorists and other parts of the North of killers in the form of herdsmen and other armed gangs ,_,  was a form ethnic cleansing against Muslims ._. According to DHQ ,_,  the Nigerian military has never waged any battle on the basis of religion or ethnicity ,_,  but against those bent on scuttling the peace and stability of the nation ,_,  adding that there was no policy or agenda to carry out massacre or extra judicial killing of law -_: abiding citizens ._.

Khalid Abubakar Aliyu ,_,  alleging extra judicial killing of Muslims and people of Fulani ethnic group by the Nigerian military is spurious and inflammatory ._. Much as the military is reluctant to join issues with a respectable religious organisation like JNI ,_,  the need to set the records straight makes this response imperative ._. The Nigerian military remains non partisan ,_,  non sectarian and will continue to be the symbol of patriotism and a unifying factor in the face of threats to national sovereignty ._. If this wild allegation was meant to cause disaffection or brew disharmony within the military ,_,  then it has woefully failed as the Nigerian military does not operate along religious or ethnic lines ._. We 'll restore sanity -_:  -_:  JonathanPresident Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  yesterday ,_,  expressed confidence that despite the escalation in terrorism attacks and the new challenge of herdsman/farmers clashes ,_,  his administration will restore sanity soon ._. Speaking at the commissioning of the Nigerian Police International Peacekeeping Training Centre and the Police Museum at force headquarters ,_,  Jonathan said though terrorism activities are inimical to the development of the country ,_,  we would stop at nothing to combat the menace ._. He said that the Police ,_,  as the lead security agency in a democracy ,_,  have a cardinal role to play in containing internal security ._. 
Abuja � The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board ,_,  JAMB ,_,  yesterday ,_,  blamed the 35% drop in 2014 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination ,_,  UTME ,_,  on the activities of Boko Haram insurgency in some parts of the country ._. The Registrar and Chief Executive of JAMB ,_,  Professor Dibu Ojerinde ,_,  stated this in Abuja while briefing journalists on the board preparation for 2014 UTME ._. His declaration came against the backdrop that registration for 2014 UTME is 129 ,_, 139 less than the 1 ,_, 735 ,_, 892 recorded in 2013 ._. He said the board had started investigation on reasons Nigerian universities admitted fewer applicants to their carrying capacities ._. Ojerinde said :_:  We will not reveal our strategies to the public but we know there are security challenges in some parts of the country but of course we have made adequate arrangement to conduct examinations in such States and in everywhere in Nigeria ._. There are some areas full of insecurities and we have made adequate security arrangement and if the worse come to the worse we will result to CBT to such candidates ._. From the Northeast which is one of the troubled areas ,_,  the number of candidates coming from there is relatively lower than last year and therefore we had a shortfall and that is the reason why there were lesser candidates this year compared to last year ._. 
And you know why it is not only education that is being troubled even the economy of that areas are affected ._. 
So therefore not many people are coming out to do the exams ._. On the capacity of Nigerian universities to absorbed applicants ,_,  Ojerinde said :_:  Recently ,_,  I setup a committee to find out why Nigerian universities admit less figures to their carrying capacities ._. 
Spaces are there ,_,  the federal government has created a huge access but no admission ._. 
Most of Nigerian institutions are not responsive to their carrying capacities ._. On 2014 UTME ,_,  he said :_:  This year's examination will be in three modes :_:  Computer based test ,_,  CBT ,_,  Dual Based Test ,_,  DBT ,_,  and Paper Pencil Test  ,_,  PPT ,_,  ._. 
This desire to go full -_: blown CBT has been the resolve of the of the Board ,_,  owing to the need to curb examination hitches of result 'black -_: outs' and other forms of malpractice that have been norm in the PPT ._. 
Gov ._. 
Babangida Aliyu of Niger on Tuesday urged anti -_: corruption agencies to be more proactive in the fight against corruption in the country ._. Aliyu made the call when he received the members of the Fiscal Responsibility Commission led by the Acting Chairman ,_,  Mr Victor Muruako who paid him a courtesy visit ._. The governor urged them to do more in view of the public perception that the anti -_: corruption agencies were not doing enough to curb corruption in the country ._. Corruption is increasing at an alarming rate ._. 
This calls for a stronger push in fighting the scourge ._. He said the efforts of EFCC ,_,  ICPC and the Fiscal Responsibility Commission had done little to reduce corruption in the country ._. We have EFCC ,_,  we have Fiscal Responsibility Commission and we have ICPC but none of these agencies are doing enough to curb corruption ._. Today ,_,  there is no way you will not see stories in the media about corruption and there is no way court cases about corruption will not be reported by the media any day in the country ,_,  he said ._. He blamed the insurgency in the northern region of the country on the rising rate of corruption ._. In fact ,_,  corruption brought about the Boko Haram insurgency ._. Earlier ,_,  Muruako said the commission had been able to recover N114 billion in operating surplus paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund by ministries ,_,  departments ,_,  agencies and corporations ._. He said Nigeria's economy had demonstrated remarkable resilience in the years since the new fiscal regime under the Fiscal Responsibility Act became operational ._. This is in spite of corruption and reluctance at individual and institutional levels to adopt the culture of transparency and accountability ._. Muruako said 22 states had adopted the fiscal responsibility law ,_,  adding that this was not encouraging enough ._. Total compliance with the Act will guarantee a more stable economy and strengthen the nation's position as a peer leader in the region ._.  NAN
The Nigerian military on Tuesday said the timely distress call made by residents of communities close to Lake Chad saved them from a terrorist attack ._. This was made known in a statement by the Director of Defence Information ,_,  Chris Olukolade ,_,  who said the terrorists had come to those communities in search of food ._. The heavily armed terrorists ,_,  Mr ._. 
Olukolade said ,_,  ran for safety on sensing troops approach ,_,  hence could not attack the communities ._. He also said that the troops of the Multi -_: National Joint Task Force on patrol in the area have recovered some arms and ammunition the fleeing terrorists left behind ._. He said that a cordon and search of the area is going on with a view to apprehending any of the terrorists that could be lurking around ._. He also said that the assault on terrorists' enclaves in Sambisa forests and surrounding locations is still going on while operational activities around Wala ,_,  Gwoza ,_,  Pulka and environs in Borno State have intensified ._. Encounters resulting from air and land strikes and an ambush of troops on patrols in the area have resulted in the death of scores of terrorists and loss of five soldiers including an officer ._. 
All the clever rationalisations and justifications in the world for presenting a Muslim/Muslim ticket will not enable us to escape this ugly tag ._. 
As a matter of fact ,_,  they will simply confirm it ._. 
We have a lot of work to do in this respect and permit me to share just one of the things that we ought to do very quickly if we wish to avoid the consequences of our own folly ._. We must go out of our way to redress the religious imbalance in our Interim National Executive where you have virtually ALL the KEY positions in the hands of Muslims ,_,  and where it is only the lesser positions that the Christians enjoy ._. The charge that there are far many more Muslims than Christians on the Interim National Executive Committee is false because the number of Christians and Muslims in that distinguished body is more or less equal ._. The numbers are not the problem but rather the fact that virtually all the substantive positions on that 35 -_: man Executive Committee are in the hands of Muslims ._. 
The Christians that are there are either deputy or vice to one of their Muslim colleagues or the other ._. Does anyone have an idea what signal this sends Do they care about the consequences of such a signal Was this done by design or was it just an innocent mistake These questions must be asked and they must be answered ._. We have been saying all this quietly for a few months now but nothing has happened ._. 
No one seems to be listening and no one seems to care ._. 
Worst still ,_,  instead of reaching out and allaying our fears we are now being fed with subtle yet insulting and unacceptable rationalisations and justifications for what is essentially politically explosive and electorally suicidal nonsense ._. If there is no Christian in Nigeria that qualifies to be President or Vice President and that does not have the noble qualities of integrity ,_,  capacity and competence that were listed earlier ,_,  then they should tell us and we will know what to do ._. The whole thing is beginning to move in a certain direction and it stinks ._. 
An illicit and subterranean agenda seems to be unfolding and ,_,  instead of assuring us that such a thing can never happen or even be contemplated in today's Nigeria ,_,  they are telling us to live with it and that ,_,  all of a sudden ,_,  religion does not matter anymore ._. 
If it does not matter anymore then why not present a Christian/Christian ticket If it does not matter anymore then why give the impression that you are interested in the Christian vote If it does not matter anymore then why the resistance in some quarters against a Christian Presidential candidate for the partyMeanwhile ,_,  it matters enough to those who want a Muslim/Muslim ticket to be secretly advocating it and to be openly suggesting it ._. 
This is nothing more than an Islamic agenda in the making and to those who have such an agenda ,_,  and who wish to use the APC to effect it I say ,_,  That which you want to do ,_,  do it quickly and see the result of the work of your hands ._. Make no mistake about it; I speak the minds of millions of self -_: respecting and discerning Christians in this country when I say these things ,_,  and I have consulted very widely before saying them ._. I say them because I am a committed and loyal party member who wants the party to fare well in the 2015 elections and who wants them to win ._. 
I will not sit back and remain silent when I see such a precious vehicle heading for the rocks and when I see it courting self -_: destruction ._. 
Only the irresponsible ,_,  the sycophantic ,_,  and the opportunistic would do that together with those who have a hidden agenda ,_,  and who do not give a damn about the consequences of this reckless course of action on the fortunes and image of the party ._. If those that disagree with me wish to expel me from the party for saying so ,_,  please ,_,  go ahead ._. 
It will only prove my point ._. 
I have a soft spot for the APC and I have tremendous respect and affection for my friends and brothers who established it and who represent the more liberal and enlightened wing of the party ._. I am talking about people like our leader ,_,  Bola Tinubu; our National Chairman ,_,  Bisi Akande; Kayode Fayemi; Rauf Aregbesola; Ibikunle Amosun; Abiola Ajimobi; Rabiu Kwakwanso; Murtala Nyako ,_,  Tanko Al Makura; Adams Oshiomole; Rochas Okorocha; Kashim Ibrahim -_: Imam; Joseph Waku; George Akume; Joel Danlami Ikenya; Ajayi Borriface; Nuhu Ribadu; Lawal Shuaibu; Sam Nda Isaiah; Tom Ikimi; Audu Ogbeh; John Oyegun; Niyi Adebayo; Atiku Abubakar; Femi Gbajabiamilla; Yusuf Tuggar; Tony Momoh; Rotimi Makinde; Femi Ojudu; Jide Omoware; Bukola Saraki; Danjuma Goje; Adamu Abdullahi; Bello Masari; Nasir El Rufai; Adeyemi Ikuforiji; Olorunimbe Mamora ,_,  and so many others ,_,  all of whom I have been very close to for many years and all of whom are far more to me than just being mere friends or political associates ._. These people ,_,  together with a number of others ,_,  are the heart and soul of the party and they are its saving grace ._. 
I say this because ,_,  unlike a handful of others ,_,  they are essentially moderates and liberals ,_,  and they represent the forces of light within its ranks ._. 
Yet ,_,  the truth must be told ._. 
And true friends and brothers always speak the truth to one another no matter how bitter that truth is ._. If speaking that truth will cost me ,_,  then so be it ._. 
At least ,_,  I will sleep very well at night with a clear conscience knowing that I have done my very best to steer the party in the right direction and stop it from destroying itself ._. 
One thing that I will never do ,_,  no matter what ,_,  is to allow anyone or any group of people to denigrate or insult my faith or the adherents of my faith and relegate us to the position of second class citizens ._. 
This matter must be taken very seriously indeed because the consequences of not doing so will be swift ,_,  far -_: reaching ,_,  irretrievable and very grave for the APC ._. This is 2014 and not 1993 ,_,  and today things are very different ._. 
Christians cannot and must not be taken for granted ,_,  and no -_: one should attempt to sacrifice them on the altar of political expediency ._. 
Any party that seeks to do that ceases to be a political party and can be better described as a religious cult ._. 
And no Christian worth his salt can or will ever be the member of such a cult ._. 
The choice is for the leaders of the APC to make ._. 
If you are a cult ,_,  then continue on the path of self -_: destruction ,_,  but if you are a political party ,_,  then learn to be fair to Christians and to appreciate their sensitivities ._. The suggestion of a Muslim/Muslim ticket by some and the subtle rationalisation of such a repugnant and self -_: destructive agenda by others is ,_,  to say the least ,_,  nauseating ._. 
It is simply unacceptable and ,_,  in Jesus name ,_,  we reject it ._. 
Like I said earlier ,_,  those that are thinking along those lines should perish the thought and stop causing consternation ,_,  dissention and confusion ._. 
Yet ,_,  if they choose to continue to do so they should prepare for the consequences ._. The desire for a Vice Presidential candidate to emerge from the south -_: western part of the country is very strong and ,_,  if the APC really wants to win ,_,  it is the smartest thing to do ._. 
Being an unapologetic Yoruba nationalist ,_,  not only am I at the forefront of that struggle ,_,  but I also believe in it passionately ._. 
I believe that that is the right and proper thing to do and that that is our due ._. 
I also believe that if the person that the leadership of the Yoruba APC eventually decide to field as a Vice Presidential candidate is a Muslim then the north must field a Christian candidate for the Presidency ._. Conversely ,_,  if the person that the leadership of the Yoruba APC eventually decide to field as a Vice Presidential candidate is a Christian ,_,  then the north must field a Muslim candidate for the Presidency ._. 
It really is as simple as that ._. 
That is the way out and that is the winning combination and formula ._. The way to failure ,_,  disaster and ruin is to ignore this counsel and to field a northern Muslim as the Presidential candidate of the party and a Yoruba Muslim as his running mate ._. 
A word is enough for the wise ._. Yet ,_,  all hope is not lost ._. 
I say this because there are many leading northern Muslims who are highly respected elders and leaders within the ranks of the opposition who have been quietly advocating for a northern Christian that can be trusted by them and that is competent and reliable to be the candidate of the APC ._. 
They see this as the only way to ensure that the ugly tag of being a sectarian party is finally removed ._. 
They also see it as the only way that President Goodluck Jonathan can be defeated simply because a combination of the northern Christian and Muslim vote ,_,  coupled with a strong and credible Muslim running mate from the south -_: west that will garner the support of all the Yoruba regardless of their faith ,_,  cannot be defeated ._. Since we are on this topic ,_,  I am constrained to make reference to a rather strange and curious event which took place just last week ,_,  and which has some relevance to this discourse ._. The Sultan of Sokoto ,_,  who is the leader of the Muslim community in Nigeria ,_,  led a delegation to Mr ._. 
Jonathan to complain about what the Sultan described as the under -_: representation of Muslims at the Constitutional Conference ._. The President ,_,  in an uncharacteristically frank and candid manner ,_,  hit back immediately by asking the Sultan why it was that the Muslim governors of the north -_: west do not sponsor members of their Christian community to pilgrimage in Jerusalem in the same way that they sponsor the members of their Muslim community to Mecca ._. 
He urged the Sultan to tell the governors of the north -_: west to sit up and do the right thing by being fair to all ._. 
This was excellent counsel from our President and he has won many new converts and friends by asking the Sultan a pertinent question and telling him the simple truth ._. Frankly ,_,  I never knew that President Goodluck Jonathan had it in him ,_,  and I am pleasantly surprised ._. 
If the Christian population in the core north could be treated with such contempt and so unfairly by the core northern governors I really do wonder what their plight would be under a Muslim/Muslim President and Vice President ._. 
Perhaps those that tell us that religion does not matter could enlighten us about this ._. Permit me to end this rather long contribution with the words of a young ,_,  keen and insightful mind by the name of Miss ._. 
Ayobami Animashaun ._. 
In my view ,_,  Ayo has put the case against a Muslim/Muslim ticket in a succinct ,_,  compelling and simply brilliant manner ._. In an interesting and somewhat heated facebook discussion on the 29th March 2014 she wrote :_: The Presidential ticket in Nigeria is usually shared between the North/South and Muslim/Christian ._. 
To have a South/South or North/North or Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim for now will be a complete and total failure in the Nigeria we live in today ._. 
If it is true that a Muslim/Muslim ticket is currently being considered by APC then this is evidently the handy work of President Goodluck Jonathan's prayer warriors !_. He shall have a very easy ride back to Aso Villa in 2015 ._. 
I am an APC supporter but should the party field a Muslim/Muslim ticket I shall be jumping ship over to PDP for sure ._. Someone within APC isn't thinking right !_. 
99 per cent of Nigerians are extremely religious ,_,  and I am one of them ._. 
I make no apology for that ._. 
This country has over 85 million Christians ,_,  and for anyone in the APC to say they cannot find one out of 85 million to be on their ticket is extremely insulting to us ._. 
Take it or leave it; that is how I feel ._. 
I have indeed spoken the minds of many ._. No self -_: respecting Christian would support an all Muslim ticket in Nigeria today ._. 
Neither would Muslims accept a Christian/Christian ticket nor should we expect them to do so ._. 
We already hear people openly refer to the APC as the Boko Haram and the Janjaweed Party ._. 
Presenting a Muslim/Muslim ticket would only confirm this ._. 
That is absolute logic !_. Some say only a tiny percentage of our people care about religion or the faith of the candidates on the Presidential ticket ._. 
That is complete and utter bollocks !_. 
We will all be here to see the outcome of this folly !_. 
Meanwhile I will re -_: consider my support for the APC ,_,  because I cannot continue to be associated with people that are religiously insensitive !_. This is a party whose key substantive officers in the National Executive Committee are ALL Muslims !_. 
Meanwhile we are in 2014 ._. 
Did I see someone compare 1993 to today That was 21 years ago for goodness sake and so much has happened between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria since then ._. 
I am not religiously intolerant ,_,  I am simply being politically realistic in the climate we have in Nigeria today ._. 
Trying to sound politically correct can only score you little brownie points on a small Facebook thread ._. It is not common sense to come up with a Muslim/Muslim ticket in a multi -_: religious ,_,  multi -_: ethnic ,_,  multi -_: cultural state where over 50 per cent of the population are Christians ._. 
To do so not only make no sense but it is also politically suicidal ._. Go to the Christians of the North Central ,_,  the North West and the North East and tell them that you are presenting a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket and see if they do not stone you !_. 
Go to the South -_: South and the South -_: East and tell them that you are presenting a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket and see if they do not spank you ._. 
Go to the South -_: West and tell the Yoruba Christians that you are presenting a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket and see if they do not insult you ._. 
If you like ,_,  go ahead and try it !_. This will not be the first time that arrogance and the lust for power override sound judgement and wise counsel ._. 
I am seeing something very ugly behind the mask of the APC now and it is called religious bigotry ._. My advice to you is to rid yourselves of it otherwise no self -_: respecting Christian would support you ._. 
No matter what you say or do ,_,  no one can use the back door to Islamise Nigeria ._. Miss ._. 
Animashaun has spoken courageously and she has voiced an inconvenient and bitter truth ._. 
I need say no more ._. 
I rest my case ._. 
God bless Nigeria ._. 
Washington ,_,  DC � The Obama administration has been advised to disregard the claim by the 12 northern states' governors who recently visited the White House ,_,  where they blamed President Goodluck Jonathan for the mounting insurgency and killings by the Boko Haram sect ._. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs ,_,  Dr ._.  Doyin Okupe ,_,  gave the advice in Washington on Monday ,_,  saying that it was frivolous for the 12 governors to blame the Boko Haram insurgency on the best President Nigeria has ever had ._. Okupe ,_,  who addressed the media and a section of the Washington Diplomatic Corps at the National Press Club on various issues affecting the political space in the country ,_,  said it was both unserious and misleading for the governors to abandon the issue of shared experience and solution to counter terrorism and blame a president whose tenure was preceded by the activities of the terrorist group in the North ._. The presidential aide said one of the ways the president was fighting Boko Haram was through the introduction of massive education in the North inclusive of the Almajiri system which is meant to rehabilitate many young northerners whose idleness makes them easy recruits for terrorist groups such as Boko Haram ._. According to Okupe ,_,  over 10 ._. 5 million Nigerians are presently out of school and the Jonathan administration was doing all it can to get them back to the classroom with emphasis on the North -_: east geopolitical zone ._. Under Jonathan ,_,  Okupe said ,_,  the economy of Nigeria has never been this good since 1960 ,_,  surpassing the World Bank's prediction in its Gross Domestic Product GDP ._. He said under the same president Nigeria's foreign reserve had grown from about $16 billion to $42 ._. 9 billion with a rising Sovereign Wealth Fund ,_,  a robust Nigerian Stock Exchange ,_,  quoted as the largest in Africa ,_,  followed by South Africa and Egypt ._. He said these achievements had taken place in under three years of the Jonathan administration ._. 
Okupe chided the suspended Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN ,_,  Mallam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi for deceiving the Nigerian public with his ever shifting figures which moved from $49 billion to $12 billion and then $20 billion ._. He asked his hosts if the chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank would stay in office one minute longer than was necessary if he had fed the American populace with such deceptive figures ,_,  adding that there was a huge difference between a missing fund and one that was yet to be accounted for ._. He said Sanusi went on suspension because he presented a questionable and inaccurate 2012 audited account of the CBN which made the presidency to ask for the report of the 2013 audited account which he failed to present ,_,  prompting an investigation ordered by the president and you cannot run an investigation with the CBN governor in office ._. 
That was why he was asked to step aside ._. He reminded the audience that CBN governor was suspended and not sacked which was completely in order to save the nation's economy ._. Okupe asked the US audience whether it was acceptable for the US Federal Reserve Bank chairman to make such a mistakeStill detailing the achievements of the Jonathan administration ,_,  Okupe noted that the president has done well on infrastructure with 200 kilometers of road construction in every zone of the country and a comprehensive renovation of 22 airports in the country ,_,  inclusive of designs and beautification ,_,  improvement in safety ,_,  security and expansion of radar coverage ._. On agriculture ,_,  he told his audience that Nigeria was today the largest exporter of cassava overtaking Indonesia with an increase in rice production and a decrease on importation ._. According to Okupe ,_,  with the privatisation of the PHCN and transfer of ownership to private companies with 11 distribution and six generating companies ,_,  Nigeria's poor power sector which had been ailing since the 1960s would experience the expected turn around in the not too distant future ,_,  with 10 ,_, 000 megawatts generation by 2015 ._. 
Nigeria's Ambassador to the US Prof ._.  Ade Adefuye ,_,  concluded the press conference by noting the current problems of the Jonathan administration ,_,  saying it was the result of years of bad government which cannot be solved in two or three years ._. Adefuye said the Jonathan administration cannot be blamed for the terrorist activities in Nigeria as some people would want to convince the world ,_,  rather he noted that Nigeria was paying the price for trying to integrate the countries of ECOWAS through its signing of several protocol agreements that include a free passage of goods and services ,_,  which is the only reason that terrorists can come from Chad ,_,  Niger ,_,  Cameroun ,_,  strike our targets and run back to these countries ._. The ambassador reassured his audience that the Jonathan administration was trying to repair the long inherited problems of Nigeria ._. 
Minna � King Faisal award recipient Sheikh Ahmed Lemu says he plans to work towards correcting the information imparted on youths by misguided clerics which results in the Boko Haram insurgency ._. 
Lemu spoke yesterday during a visit to Niger State Governor Mu'azu Babangida Aliyu ._. Some of members of the clergy ,_,  whether Islamic or Christians ,_,  do not know the content of their holy books nor are they prepared to follow the content and some of them are misleading their followers which lead to social problems ,_,  he said ._. In his remarks ,_,  the governor who expressed delight for the award said it is not only for Sheik Lemu but also for the state ,_,  being the second Nigerian to receive it after the late Sheikh Abubakar Gumi ._. 
He said the award would spur him to continue to contribute to the development of mutual understanding between Muslims and Christians ._. 
From President Goodluck Jonathan Tuesday came an assurance to Nigerians of the determination of his administration to checkmate the activities of Boko Haram with a view to making the nation safe again ._. He said in Abuja at the inauguration of the Nigeria Police International Peacekeeping Centre and Police Museum that despite the escalating cases of terrorism in the North -_: east ,_,  he was determined to restore sanity to the country ._. He identified terrorism as a threat to the development of the country and vowed that he would stop at nothing to combat the menace ._. There has been an upsurge in attacks ,_,  especially on soft targets by Boko Haram insurgents in the wake of the renewed onslaught against members of the terrorist group by the military ._. The attacks have raised fears over the possibility of holding elections in the North -_: east in 2015 ,_,  but Chief of Air Staff ,_,  Air Marshal Adesola Amosu ,_,  has assured Nigerians that the military will ensure the zone is secured and stable enough for the polls ._. Reiterating his commitment to make sure Nigerians no longer live in fear over the activities of the insurgents ,_,  the president said :_:  I hardly need to say that we live in a changing time in which we are witnessing unprecedented violence and criminal acts ._. 
We are witnessing an escalation of terrorism ._. Terrorist acts and insurgencies are inimical to our progress ._. 
Our dear country has unfortunately experienced this odious development ._. 
We are determined to confront them and checkmate crime in our society ._. It is imperative that the Nigeria Police Force as the lead agency in the maintenance of internal security must play an active role in combating terror and providing security for our people ._. 
This is the major and compelling role of the police today ._. I have every confidence that the Nigeria Police Force will be alive to this responsibility ._. 
I wish to assure the force and the Nigerian people that everything will be done to fully support the force in our determined effort to ensure the security of our nation ._. 
Our people must live without fear ._. The president praised security agencies for their commitment to the anti -_: terror war ,_,  saying :_:  For the ordinary people ,_,  they may not know the commitment and the contribution of the army ,_,  the police and the State Security Service and their sacrifices ._. 
But for me who is at the centre of everything ,_,  I know what they have been doing and I believe God being with us ,_,  we will overcome the challenges ._. Jonathan expressed delight to inaugurate the police museum and the Nigeria Police International Peacekeeping Institute ._. I am indeed pleased to know that these two projects have been initiated by the police management in support of the policy thrust of this present administration aimed at building and sustaining a strong ,_,  capable and efficient police force that can fulfill its mandate and hold its own among its peers in the world ,_,  he said ._. He recalled the exploits of the police in international peacekeeping operations which started from their maiden foray in Congo in 1960 ._. According to him ,_,  it has been widely acknowledged as a matter of national pride that Nigerian police officers maintain the tradition of excellence in peacekeeping operations in the world ._. The construction of the police peacekeeping institute is a step in the right direction ._. 
I am confident that it will be utilised to train and build the required capacity of our troops as they meet their obligation in domestic and international peacekeeping duties ._. 
The Nigeria Police Force has a rich history ._. 
The museum being inaugurated will warehouse artifacts celebrating its involvement and accomplishments in both domestic and international peacekeeping operations ._. I believe that the museum will be used as a centre of learning and raise the whole body of knowledge of the force in coping with the duty that has been entrusted to them ,_,  he added ._. Earlier ,_,  Inspector General of Police IG ,_,  Mr ._. 
Mohammed Abubakar ,_,  had recalled that police participation in peacekeeping started in 1960 with the first IG ,_,  Louis Edet ,_,  deployed in Congo ._. He said due to the successes recorded in promoting the core values of peacekeeping ,_,  Nigeria was again the first country to deploy the first formed police unit in Liberia in 1994 which made the African Union AU to request another formed unit in Somalia ._. 
He commended Jonathan for promoting the welfare of the police ,_,  especially with the several housing programmes in various parts of the country as well as the construction of hospitals and schools ,_,  procurement and refurbishment of police equipment ,_,  among others ._. He said the international peacekeeping centre would serve as a training facility for police formations in Africa ._. Also yesterday ,_,  Amosu assured Nigerians that the military would ensure that the North -_: east is secured and stable enough for the 2015 general election ._. Briefing reporters in Abuja on the activities lined up for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Nigerian Air Force ,_,  which he said would be low -_: key as a result of the state of insecurity and commitment of their personnel across the country ,_,  Amosu said :_:  We must stabilise the North -_: east and we must ensure that elections take place ._. 
Democracy is something vital to our nation; and we are defenders of democracy ._. According to him ,_,  one of the challenges facing the military in the North -_: east is the lack of information by citizens and urged them to cooperate with the troops in the fight against the insurgency ._. He explained that with necessary information from the people ,_,  perhaps the North -_: east would have been stabilised by now ._. Meanwhile ,_,  troops of the Multi -_: National Joint Task Force MNJTF have foiled bids by Boko Haram insurgents to attack some communities in Borno State ._. The troops ,_,  reacting to distress calls ,_,  saved communities besieged by the terrorists who were searching for food around the Lake Chad area ,_,  from being massacred ._. The Director of Defence Information DDI ,_,  Maj -_: Gen Chris Olukolade ,_,  said in a statement yesterday that the heavily armed terrorists scampered for safety and abandoned their mission when they learnt that the troops were approaching ._. 
Olukolade said the MNJTF patrol of the area had so far recovered some arms and ammunition left behind by fleeing terrorists ._. He added that the assault on terrorists' enclaves in Sambisa forests and surrounding locations was continuing ._. Operational activities around Wala ,_,  Gwoza ,_,  Pulka and environs have been intensified ._. 
Encounters resulting from air and land strikes and an ambush of troops on patrols in the area have resulted in the death of scores of terrorists and loss of five soldiers including an officer ,_,  he said ._. 
If the abduction of two Italian priests and a Canadian nun is confirmed to have been conducted by Boko Haram ,_,  it will be the Islamist militants' third kidnapping in northern Cameroon ._. At approximately 2 am on the morning of 5 April ,_,  two Italian priests and a Canadian nun were abducted from their residence in northern Cameroon ._. 
The incident occurred in Tchere ,_,  a settlement located in Cameroon's Far North Region which shares a border with Nigeria ._. While there have been no immediate claims of responsibility for the abduction ,_,  suspicion has fallen on the Nigerian -_: based Islamist militant group Boko Haram ,_,  which is believed to have established an operational presence in the region ._. 
If confirmed ,_,  the latest kidnapping would mark the third abduction of foreign nationals by Boko Haram in northern Cameroon ._. In the first such incident ,_,  the militant group kidnapped a French family from the town of Dabanga on 19 February 2013 ._. 
Boko Haram's shadowy leader ,_,  Abubakar Shekau ,_,  claimed responsibility for the abduction and demanded that the Cameroonian government release all detained group members in exchange for the French hostages ._. The family of seven was released unharmed in April 2013 amid speculation that France had paid a ransom of $3 million ,_,  though the exact circumstances surrounding the release remain unclear ._. Boko Haram's second kidnapping in Cameroon occurred on 13 November 2013 ,_,  when suspected group members abducted French priest ,_,  Georges Vandenbeusch ,_,  from the Far North Cameroonian town of Koza ._. A few days after the incident ,_,  Boko Haram confirmed its involvement in the kidnapping in a statement provided to the Agence France -_: Presse ._. 
Vandenbeusch was eventually released unharmed a month after his capture amid claims that French authorities had again paid a cash ransom to the group ._. Both France and Boko Haram denied that a ransom was paid ,_,  however ,_,  with the Islamists claiming that the priest was freed by Shekau on compassionate grounds ._. 
But this account was in turn denied by a Cameroon military source who said that Vandenbeusch was exchanged for a senior Boko Haram commander who had been detained by Cameroonian authorities ._. Abductions in NigeriaWhile these foreign kidnappings in Cameroon were the first to be claimed by Boko Haram ,_,  they were preceded by similar abductions in neighboring Nigeria ._. On 12 May 2011 ,_,  British national ,_,  Chris McManus ,_,  and his Italian compatriot ,_,  Franco Lamolinara were abducted from their residence in the northern Nigeria city of Birnin Kebbi ._. 
The victims ,_,  who were engineers of the B ._. 
Stabilini construction company ,_,  were executed by their captors on March 2012 in the city of Sokoto following a failed rescue attempt by Nigerian and British Special Forces ._. Their abduction ,_,  which the British Foreign Office linked to Boko Haram ,_,  marked the first kidnapping of foreigners in Nigeria at the hands of Islamist militants ._. Less than eight months later ,_,  German engineer Edgar Fritz Raupach became the second foreigner to be kidnapped by the Islamist insurgents when he was seized in the northern city of Kano ._. 
Similarly to Lamolinara and McManaus ,_,  Raupach was executed during a failed rescue attempt in May 2012 ._. Although al -_: Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb AQIM claimed Raupach's abduction ,_,  analysts such as Martin Ewi from South Africa's Institute for Security Studies ISS claimed that Boko Haram facilitated the kidnapping in return for training they had received from AQIM in Mali ._. Although Boko Haram was already engaging in kidnapping ,_,  the threat to foreign expatriates was arguably only truly realised on 19 December 2012 when Ansaru ,_,  a group believed to be a breakaway faction of Boko Haram ,_,  orchestrated one of the most daring and well -_: executed kidnapping operations seen in northern Nigeria ._. In the attack ,_,  dozens of its militants seized French engineer ,_,  Francis Colump ,_,  from a guarded compound in the town of Rimi ,_,  located in Nigeria's Katsina state ._. Less than 24 hours after the abduction ,_,  Ansaru claimed responsibility for the kidnapping which it said was retaliation for France banning women from wearing a full -_: face veil in public and the French government's planned intervention in against Islamists in northern Mali ._. On 19 February 2013 ,_,  the group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of seven further foreign expatriate workers ,_,  employed by the Lebanese -_: owned Setraco construction company ,_,  in the Jama'are local government area in Bauchi State ._. On 10 March 2013 ,_,  the group released a video claiming that it had executed the hostages in response to a government attempt to free the hostages ._. Operational changeIn recent years ,_,  Nigeria -_: based armed groups have gained notoriety for the kidnapping foreign expatriates ._. 
The tactic was previously employed by Nigerian militants operating in the country's southern Niger Delta as a means of soliciting both socio -_: economic concessions from the Nigerian government and ransom payments from multinational firms operating within the oil -_: rich region ._. The relative success of these groups further served to encourage criminal networks ,_,  which have also abducted foreign expatriates within and outside the country's borders ._. However ,_,  the use of kidnapping as an operational tactic by Nigerian Islamists is a development that has a much wider -_: reaching impact than merely scaring off would -_: be tourists or stymieing foreign investment ._. With the Nigerian government already struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency which may be expanding outside its borders ,_,  the use of kidnapping will only further complicate counterinsurgency initiatives ._. Ransom payments will likely be used to purchase more weaponry and/or recruit more fighters ,_,  while hostage exchanges will also result in the likes of Boko Haram and Ansaru reclaiming high level members and subsequently strengthening their operational capabilities ._. Moreover ,_,  the recent increase of foreign kidnappings in northern Nigeria and neighbouring Cameroon may itself be indicative of an operational evolution of Nigerian -_: based Islamist militant groups ._. To date ,_,  the tactic has been employed with great efficacy by various al -_: Qaeda -_: linked groups who have kidnapped foreign nationals in the likes of Algeria ,_,  Mali and Mauritania ._. In a declassified report issued by the British government in 2013 ,_,  it was estimated that at least $70 million in ransom payments had been paid to Islamist kidnappers since 2009 and that al -_: Qaeda's North African branch had received an estimated $45 million ._. Nevertheless ,_,  in accordance with the high pay -_: offs ,_,  the kidnapping of foreign nationals remains a high -_: risk undertaking subject to various logistical and operational challenges ._. In this regard ,_,  the fact that Nigerian Islamists have been able to execute such abductions with a relative degree of success speaks volumes of their own operational capabilities ._. Perhaps even more disconcertingly ,_,  the use of kidnapping as an operational tactic by Boko Haram and Ansaru could serve as the most credible evidence of some form of connection or cooperation between these groups and wider al -_: Qaeda -_: linked networks ._.

Monrovia � Nigerian nationals residing in Liberia under the Banner Nigerian Community and Descendent Union in Liberia took into protest Tuesday in demand of the recall of their Ambassador accredited to Liberia Ambassador Chigozie F ._. 
Obi -_: Nnadozie ._. 
The aggrieved Nigerian in a statement accused their ambassador of always referring to them as thieves and criminals and not serving in their best interest ._. The statement which they said meets the consensus of the executive and council of elders of the Nigerian community and descendent Union in Liberia ,_,  calls for all Nigerians in Liberia to embark on a one week fast and pray for the government of Nigeria to see reason to recall their Ambassador ._. The group said in their statement :_:  Ambassador Chigozie F ._. 
Obi -_: Nnadozie continuous stay in Liberia is not only inimical to the welfare of all the people of Nigeria in Liberia ,_,  but also injurious to the supreme interest of the Federal Republic of Liberia as a state ._. All attempts to get comments from the Ambassador did not materialize as reporters were informed by private security officers protecting the embassy that the Embassy staff were in a meeting ._. We want the ambassador to leave ,_,  she has been tormenting us ,_,  she has called us all types of names so we are here to tell Liberians that we are neither criminals nor Boko -_: Haram ,_,  one of the aggrieved Protesters said ._. 
Lagos � ACCESS to Justice ,_,  the human rights advocacy group ,_,  has called on government to set up a panel to investigate the killing of 21 Boko Haram suspects at the State Security Service SSS detention facility in Abuja ._. Secret Police Authority in Abuja had claimed that the 21 suspected Boko Haram members were killed during the exchange of gunfire that allegedly followed an attempted jailbreak ._. Operatives claimed that some of its officials sustained several degrees of gun wounds during the battle ._. Access to Justice has however faulted the account of the jailbreak rendered by the secret police authorities as it noted that many questions were left unanswered ._. It queried the SSS account of events ._. The group pointed out that official account of the incident said that shots were fired at a detainee but did not state what other detainees did to deserve being killed ._. �A literal interpretation of this statement is that other detainees who posed no danger to the DSS or its operatives ,_,  or ,_,  who ,_,  in fact made no attempts to escape from detention were fired at to prevent them from even contemplating the possibility of fleeing ._. There is no clear justification provided by the DSS or the Nigerian State for the killing of such a multitude of vulnerable persons ,_,  it said ._. The group has therefore called for an inquiry which must be free from external influence or control and undertaken by people of unquestionable integrity ._. The group also urged that the results of the inquiry be made public and any persons found to have killed without clear ,_,  reasonable and lawful justification be brought to account and to justice ._. 
The kidnappers asked Mr ._. 
Marama's family to link them with Governor Shettima or Senator Ndume within an hour ._. Gunmen have kidnapped a former Borno governorship aspirant in the state ._. Family sources said Stephen Marama ,_,  a governorship aspirant during the 1979 general elections ,_,  was on Saturday kidnapped while on his way back to Maiduguri ,_,  the Borno State capital ._. 
He had visited his country home ,_,  Marama ,_,  in Hawul Local Government Area of the state ._. The abductors reportedly took the politician away in his LX 760 jeep ._. The kidnappers have threatened to kill the politician if his family fails to link them up with the Governor of Borno State ,_,  Kashim Shettima or the Senator representing Borno South ,_,  Ali Ndume ._. The abductors had on Tuesday noon called the politician's family warning them not to involve the security lest their father be killed ._. 
The abductors ,_,  who called using Mr ._. 
Marama's phone number ,_,  instructed the eldest son ,_,  Bundi Madu ,_,  to link them with either Mr ._. 
Shettima or Mr ._. 
Ndume within one hour ._. 
They threatened to kill Mr ._. 
Marama if the family failed to carry out their instruction ._. A family source who spoke to PREMIUM TIMES said ,_,  We have been trying to get across to Governor Kashim Shettima and Senator Ali Ndume but to avail ._. 
Now we are confused because the kidnappers who spoke with us using our father's phone told us that if they did not get to speak with either the Borno state governor or Senator Ali Ndume in the next one hour ,_,  they will be left with no option than to execute him ._. Family members said they are confused as they expected the kidnappers to make a ransom demand ._. 
They said they were worried as the one hour ultimatum expired and they still have not heard from the abductors again ._. The kidnappers are aware that these people Governor Shettima and Senator Ndume are not easily reached ,_,  except by luck ._. 
I think they only want to kill him because they know there is no way we can get these people to ask them to speak to them within an hour ._. 
Our family has been disturbed since we received the call and was told that our father has been kidnapped ,_,  said a relative ._. Security agencies said they were not aware of the kidnap when PREMIUM TIMES contacted both the police and the Department of State Security ,_,  DSS ._. Boko Haram abductors are known to ask for large sums of money from government and family members as ransom before they release any victim ._. 
Many residents of Maiduguri who are aware of the kidnap wonder what the abductors want for insisting on getting a direct link with top government officials ._. 
Governors of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe ,_,  facing the challenges of Boko Haram insurgency on Wednesday urged the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC not to postpone the 2015 general elections in the states ._. The call was contained in a statement jointly issued in Maiduguri by their spokespersons ._. The statement urged INEC to disregard calls by some politicians for the postponement of the elections due to the security situation in the states ._. It urged INEC to take a cue from war -_: ravaged Afghanistan where elections were recently held ,_,  in spite of threat of attacks by the Taliban terrorist group ._. INEC should take a cue from Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission which courageously held the country's presidential and provincial election last Saturday despite strong threats issued by the Taliban ._. Afghanistan was celebrated worldwide for liberating herself from the scourge of fear ,_,  thereby sending a strong signal that no threat would prevent them from choosing their leaders through democratic processes ,_,  it said ._. The statement further pointed out that the Afghan government provided adequate security for the conduct of the polls ,_,  urging the Federal Government to do same ._. INEC should as a matter of counter insurgency approach ,_,  ensure that no part of Nigeria is excluded from the election ._. 
The announcement of the discovery in Cameroon of a large cache of arms and ammunition intended for Boko Haram insurgents in Nigeria is regarded in some quarters as government propaganda ._. There was alarm in northern Cameroon when it was announced in early April that two Italian priests and a nun had been kidnapped by suspected members of the Islamist sect Boko Haram ,_,  which is waging an insurgency in neighboring Nigeria ._. The whereabouts of the three are still unknown ._. 
But as news of their disappearance was breaking ,_,  the Cameroonian government announced it had seized a huge cache of arms and ammunition ostensibly destined for Boko Haram ._. 
However it now seems that the mysterious arms find could be a complete fabrication ._. An announcement on Cameroon's state radio appeared to leave no doubt ._. 
The governor of the Far North Region has congratulated the forces of law and order and administrative authorities of Logone and Chari Division for impounding a huge quantity of arms and ammunition which was being smuggled for onward supply to the Boko Haram group ._. 
The radio station went on to say that Cameroonian defense forces had seized some 5 ,_, 400 firearms ._. Boko Haram in northern CameroonBoko Haram is fighting to establish an Islamic state ruled solely by Sharia law ._. 
The sect is based in northeastern Nigeria and is very active on Cameroon's northern border ._. The media in Cameroon have been reporting for some time that the Islamist group was using Cameroon's northern territories as training grounds for its fighters ._. These reports have been denied by the government in Yaounde ._. 
The seizure of the weapons ,_,  said government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakari ,_,  was a clear sign that the Cameroonian government saw the Islamist fighters as a threat and would not tolerate them pursuing their aims from Cameroonian territory ._. This the find is the best way to deny any allegations that Cameroon is being used as a base for insurgents for the destabilization of other countries ,_,  Bakari told DW's correspondent in Cameroon ._. Villagers deny government claimsThe government says the firearms were seized in a small village called Kekte ._. However ,_,  villagers interviewed by DW's correspondent said they knew nothing about such a find or alleged Boko Haram activity in the area ._. 
Village chief Alim Bachir said he believed it could be a case of government propaganda ._. 
He said that ,_,  had there been any weapons in the vicinity ,_,  he would certainly have known about them ._. The government also claimed it had arrested several Islamist fighters when the firearms were discovered ._. 
They are said to be in detention in the northern town of Kolofata ._. 
However ,_,  the town's Muslim leader Imam Hamaounde dismissed the claims ._. When confronted with the statements by Chief Bachir and Imam Hamaounde ,_,  government spokesman Bachari refused to comment other than to say the statements contradicting the government's version of events were defamatory ._. In March Nigeria asked its neighbors Cameroon ,_,  Niger and Chad to join it in creating a task force to fight terrorism in the region ._. All four are members of the Lake Chad Basin Commission and work closely together to monitor and coordinate actions that could affect the level and quality of water in the lake ._. Cameroon's response at the time was to say it would only contribute troops when absolutely necessary ._. 
In the meantime ,_,  it says it will make sure its northern territories are safe for the people living there ._. 
In commemoration of the United Nations Day on Sports for Peace and Development in Nigeria ,_,  some school children took the playing field for a Football Match for Peace ,_,  on Friday ,_,  April 4 ._. The match ,_,  which was played between LEA School ,_,  Utako and LEA School ,_,  Zone 2 ,_,  ended 1 -_: 0 in favour of LEA Utako ._. With the continuous attack on Nigerians by the insurgents in the North -_: East ,_,  especially with the murder of about 22 children in February by the dreaded Boko Haram sect ,_,  the school children thought it very relevant to ask for peace using sport ._. Isah Ahmed ,_,  a Primary 6 school student of LEA Utako ,_,  urged the Federal Government to put a stop to the killings and find a way to stop Boko Haram tormenting Nigerians ._. I want to beg the government to put a stop to the killing of school children ._. 
Boko Haram should also ,_,  please ,_,  stop torturing the people; please ,_,  I beg ,_,  he said ._. The International Day of Sports for Peace is aimed at highlighting the potential of sports to advance peoples' life and promote global solidarity ._. The event coordinator ,_,  an award winning journalist ,_,  Aderonke Ogunleye ,_,  said she organised the event because she believed there is power in sports for development ._. Sports is a powerful tool for development ._. 
It helps in spreading messages of peace ,_,  driving social change and meeting the millennium development goals ,_,  and we equally use it to ask for peace in Nigeria ._. 
I believe in a peaceful nation ,_,  a peaceful Nigeria and it can be echoed through this football match ,_,  she saidSpeaking about the event ,_,  she said the football match was a successful one ._. 'The school children were all happy with what they did ._. 
Being peace ambassadors made them happy ._. 
I join millions of Nigerians to tell all the terrorist groups to stop the attack and embrace peace ,_,  she said ._. Eugene Igbudu ,_,  a representative of the UNAIDS Country director ,_,  Camara Bilali ,_,  at the event ,_,  also said UNAIDS is on a road to educate for peace ._. It is our own way of bringing peace to the nation ._. 
We are here to educate children and Nigerians on the need for peace through activities like sports ,_,  which is a universal language ._. 
This way we can achieve peace and achieve all our goals and objectives ,_,  it is a developmental process ,_,  he said ._. The event was sponsored by the Nigeria Football Federation ,_,  the Nigerian Red cross ,_,  UNAIDS ,_,  UNFPA ,_,  UNICEF and John Utaka Foundation ._. Ms ._. 
Ogunleye thanked the partners for helping bring the event to fruition ._. We thank all our partners for being part of this remarkable event ._. 
It actually shows that they are socially responsible ,_,  and also showed their contributions to the society ._. 
We are indeed grateful and I wish them all the best ,_,  she said ._. 
Scene One :_:  On March 27 this year ,_,  a Police Corporal ,_,  Sunkanmi Ogunbiyi ,_,  attached to the State Criminal Investigation Department of the Ogun State Police Command left his station and headed home where he turned his gun on estranged wife ,_,  also a police Corporal ,_,  his landlady ,_,  a 2 -_: year -_: old toddler and several others ,_,  before shooting himself ._. 
At the end of the gruesome affair ,_,  six lives were wasted while three survivors sustained serious gunshot injuries ._. Scene Two :_:  On April 6 this year ,_,  five gunmen entered St ._.  John Anglican Church ,_,  Oke -_: Sopen in Ijebu -_: Igbo ,_,  Ogun State while the service was going on to pump bullets into Chief Tola Okuneye ,_,  a ._. k ._. a Ajagajigi ,_,  69 ._. 
By the time the gunmen who had earlier pretended to be worshippers were done ,_,  Okuneye ,_,  Chairman of the Oodua Peoples Congress OPC who also doubled as chair of the Police Community Relations Committee ,_,  was no more ._. Scene Three :_:  On April 5 this year ,_,  Yargaladima village in Zamfara State was invaded by dozens of gunmen ,_,  riding on motorcycles and carrying dangerous weapons ,_,  including AK 47 rifles ._. 
They stormed a meeting of a vigilante group and professionals planning how to confront Boko Haram insurgents ._. 
A survivor of the attack ,_,  Mallam Muhamadu Yargaladima ,_,  completes the story :_:  Using AK 47 and other rifles ,_,  they began to shoot at children ,_,  traders ,_,  vigilante ,_,  community leaders ,_,  clerics ,_,  thereby killing 215 people at the end of the four -_: hour operation ._. Scene Four :_:  On March 17 this year ,_,  two Britons ,_,  Piers Eastwood and Vincent Haywood ,_,  and their 12 Nigerian accomplices were apprehended by the Joint Task Force JTF ,_,  Operation Pulo Shield ,_,  over their involvement in illegal bunkering along the Chanomi Creek in Delta State ._. 
The suspects ,_,  representatives of an oil servicing company ,_,  had offered some hefty bribe money to fuel a gunboat that would escort the stolen crude oil they wanted to ferry out of Nigeria ._. Last Sunday ,_,  Nigeria's Gross Domestic Product GDP was rebased by the National Bureau of Statistics NBS which pushed our economy into the first position in Africa and the 24th in the world with Belgium and Poland ,_,  overtaking South Africa ._. 
Not surprisingly ,_,  many commentators have dismissed the exercise because ,_,  as they argue ,_,  at just $3000 per capita income ,_,  it is fallacious to say Nigeria's economy is above South Africa's that is on $7 ,_, 336 per capita income ._. 
A few people have also argued that placing Nollywood above India's Bollywood is carrying fantasy too far ._. 
Yet there are others who refuse to accept that Nigeria is now above countries like Austria ,_,  Argentina and Iran in economic terms ._. At this point ,_,  there are salient questions to ask :_:  Was the exercise necessary The answer is yes because it is routine in most countries and essential for the investing community ._. 
For instance ,_,  on Monday ,_,  the London Financial Times reported that the United Kingdom Office of National Statistics will soon reveal data to indicate that their economy is bigger and in better shape than had been earlier projected ._. 
Are the figures from our National Bureau of Statistics NBS credible I believe that on balance they are ,_,  especially considering the fact that the NBS Director General ,_,  Dr Yemi Kale put a rather instructive caveat :_:  While GDP depicts how rich a nation is ,_,  this is not necessarily the same as showing how rich individuals in the nation are ,_,  due to problem of unequal distribution of wealth ._. 
Similarly ,_,  growth in GDP is not synonymous with job creation ._.  this is the challenge of non -_: inclusive growth ._. While the debate can go on ,_,  I feel rather uncomfortable with Nigerians who are ever quick to dismiss any positive news about our country while those who politicize the routine exercise to attack President Goodluck Jonathan's administration miss the point ._. 
However ,_,  I am also of the opinion that China presents a good model on how to handle situations like this ._. 
While the country has the second largest economy in the world ,_,  their authorities continue to project their huge population and the fact that many of their citizens are yet to be lifted out of poverty ._. 
We should be honest enough to admit that we also have serious challenge of poverty and unemployment in Nigeria despite our abundant human and material resources ._. Whatever the merit of the NBS statistics ,_,  it is also a fact that if we rebase other aspects of our national life ,_,  we may end up with unflattering figures ._. 
I am not even talking about the fact that South African companies from MTN to Shoprite are gradually colonizing our country ._. 
Nor am I alluding to the growing inequalities in wealth and opportunities which made the World Bank President ,_,  Dr Jim Yong Kim to say recently that two thirds of the world's extreme poor are concentrated in five countries -_:  -_:  -_: India ,_,  China ,_,  Nigeria ,_,  Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo ._. 
I am more concerned by the growing violence in our country and its damaging implications ,_,  even for the economy ._. On Monday ,_,  the Global Peace Index for 2013 was released ._. 
The Index used three broad indicators :_:  the level of safety and security in society; extent of domestic or international conflict; and the degree of militarization ._. 
Our country did not fare well in the report which usually serves as a guide to potential investors ._. 
In fact ,_,  the Positive Peace Index PPI which measures the strength of the attitudes of 126 nations to determine their capacity to create and maintain a peaceful society ranked Nigeria 122 among 126 countries ._. While I intend to interrogate the challenge of our economy with respect to the broken educational system ,_,  collapsing infrastructure and the unemployment problem another day ,_,  what is of concern to me today is how to deal with the growing violence in our country based on the four scenarios with which I opened the page ._. 
They represent the several dimensions of the violence that is daily being encountered in our country ._. 
It is not that such bloody occurrences are restricted to Nigeria but rather in the way we deal or refuse to deal with them ,_,  which quite naturally ,_,  impact on several things ,_,  including ,_,  if not especially ,_,  the national economy ._. Take the first ._. 
It is not likely that there will be any investigation to unravel why a man would kill his wife ,_,  his landlord and her children yet it is easy to point in the direction of what could be a psychiatric challenge ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  that case is closed which then means there will be no lesson to learn ._. 
The point being underscored here is that there are violent acts in our country today that result from issues of mental health but that is one area we do not pay attention to ._. 
Yet as people undergo social and economic pressure ,_,  it is a problem that is bound to increase ._. 
And we must deal with it ._. The second scenario may not have been taken from a T ._. 
S ._. 
Eliot's play ,_,  Murder in the Cathedral but the title might just have made a sinister impression on someone ._. 
That gunmen would enter a church to mix with worshippers before shooting their target looks much like a case of assassination ._. 
This kind of crime is also prevalent because no single killing of such nature has ever been successfully investigated and prosecuted in the country ._. 
Not one !_. 
In a society where the rule of law is absent ,_,  what you have will be rule of the jungle !_. The third scene is a classic case of terrorism ._. 
Invading a village to kill ,_,  maim and rape innocent people with whom you had no problem can only be classified as such ,_,  whatever the nomenclature of the group involved or the motivation ._. 
This is another critical challenge confronting our nation today and the jury is still out as to whether we are facing up to it with the right tool ._. 
The last is organised crime with economic motive but we should worry because the international criminal cartel involved in oil theft is also to a large extent responsible for bringing in massive cache of arms into the country ._. However ,_,  as diverse as the four scenarios are ,_,  one thing connects them and that is the ease with which guns can be procured in our country today ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  the authorities don't seem to be paying much attention to Hon Nnnena Ukeje ,_,  chairman of the House of Representatives committee on Foreign Affairs ,_,  who has been leading a campaign on how to tackle the menace ._. 
She is at the vanguard of the efforts to get the Bill for the establishment of a national commission to deal with the proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons SALW passed not only to meet our international commitment but also to contain the growing domestic challenge of violence ._. Some of the questions we need to interrogate ,_,  according to Ukeje ,_,  are :_:  What is driving the current high demand for these dangerous weapons in our country Who are the entrepreneurs of violence paying for them What are the sources of these arms and how do they come in How do we deal with the social ,_,  political and economic pressures that engender violence Have we built the requisite capacity to take inventory of the arms and ammunitions that enter the country officially and how they are deployed When and how do we create a platform for a national conversation on these and many other related issuesSmall arms by the way include revolvers and self -_: loading rifles and pistols ,_,  assault rifles ,_,  sub -_: machine guns and light machine guns while light weapons include heavy machine guns ,_,  hand -_: held grenade launchers ,_,  portable launchers of anti -_: aircraft and anti -_: tank missile systems ._. 
According to the United Nations ,_,  since weapons in this class are capable of being carried ,_,  if by small arm ,_,  by one person or ,_,  if a light arm ,_,  by two or more people ,_,  a pack animal or a light vehicle ,_,  they allow for mobile operations where heavy mechanized and air forces are not available or are restricted in their capabilities owing to difficult mountain ,_,  jungle or urban terrain ._. Indeed ,_,  Hon Ukeje poses other questions which include :_:  Have efforts ever been made to demilitarize theatres of violence in our country after bloody encounters Are we adopting the right approach in the bid to secure the compliance of Cameroun to give our military authorities the needed right of pursuit against Boko Haram insurgents that find easy abode in their territory To what extent have we complied with the United Nations Resolution 2117 and the ECOWAS Moratorium concerning SALW that was signed in Abuja With privatised security groups in the form of vigilante that are all over the country ,_,  the growing crude -_: for -_: arms in the Niger Delta that is happening right before our eyes ,_,  the rise in ethnic militias and the fact that there are about 200 illegal routes between Nigeria and Benin Republic alone ,_,  Hon Ukeje is of the strong conviction that we are toast if we do not act fast enough to contain the growing danger ._. Some of the arms and ammunitions highlighted are those with which Boko Haram and all manner of criminals including kidnappers ,_,  armed robbers etc ._.  are wreaking havoc in our country today ._. 
And there is no way we can bring an end to the violence until we are able to deal with the supply of these dangerous weapons that have literally become two -_: for -_: ten kobo ._. 
Yet the violence that has now become prevalent in our country is not only dimming the local economy but also scaring away foreign investments with all the attendant consequences ._. 
The bigger tragedy is that we are not only leaving behind a whole section of Nigeria but indeed a whole generation of our young population :_:  Those who cannot go to school either as a result of violence in their current location or the non -_: availability of space two million candidates will be sitting for JAMB this year or the lack of means by their parents; and those who cannot find job after completing schools because the opportunities are simply not there ._. Three years ago ,_,  the World Investment Report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD stated that the Nigerian economy had lost some N1 ._. 3 trillion due to the activities of Boko Haram ._. 
According to UNCTAD ,_,  foreign direct investment to Nigeria fell to N933 billion in 2010 from N1 ._. 3 trillion in 2009 ,_,  a decline of 29 percent ._. 
That was four years ago yet the security situation has worsened between then and now ._. To compound the situation ,_,  the activities of Boko Haram combined with that of cattle rustlers have virtually rendered the economy of majority of the states in the North prostrate ._. 
That then explains why many believe that the new GDP figures do not account for the fiscal bucket with a big hole because it is difficult to put a price at the hundreds of thousands of people that are daily dislodged from their homes and means of livelihood in Borno ,_,  Yobe ,_,  Adamawa ,_,  Zamfara and lately Nasarawa ,_,  Benue ,_,  Taraba ,_,  Plateau and Kaduna States ._. 
The larger implication is that such state of affairs provides a breeding ground for young people to be recruited into criminal gangs as can be seen from the profiles of those that are usually paraded for the killings ._. 
Majority of them are either in their teens or twenties -_: people who ordinarily should be in school ._. From the foregoing ,_,  it is important for us to take seriously the menace of small arms and light weapons but that is just one side of the story ._. 
We also need to take the young men and women out of the streets and take the guns out of the hands of those who are already far gone ._. 
But that would require revamping our educational system and providing outlets for job creation ._. 
That is the challenge for all of us ,_,  not only people in government ._. 
And it is something we have to take seriously if we are not to lose our country and its future ._. A 2010 report sponsored by the British Council in Nigeria and coordinated by David Bloom ,_,  Harvard University Professor of Economics and Demography ,_,  is fast becoming a self -_: fulfilling prophesy ._. 
Titled Nigeria -_: The Next Generation the report states :_:  Nigeria is at a crossroads :_:  one path offers a huge demographic dividend ,_,  with tremendous opportunity for widespread economic and human progress ,_,  while the other path leaves Nigeria descending into quicksand ._. 
Nigeria's most important asset is its young people  -_:  more important than oil ._. 
History has proven young adults to be a powerful agent of beneficial change ,_,  especially if they are healthy and educated ,_,  with decent job prospects ._. It is indeed instructive that several Nigerian professionals ,_,  including the current Coordinating Minister for the Economy Dr ._.  Ngozi Okonjo -_: Iweala ,_,  then Managing Director at the World Bank collaborated on the report ._. 
Their conclusion was that Nigeria had become poorly positioned to maximise the economic opportunities created by its demographics yet if this potential is not harnessed ,_,  it will become an increasingly disruptive force ._. 
With the right policies ,_,  the report concludes ,_,  Nigeria could easily become one of the world's leading economies; and with wrong choices ,_,  Nigeria's development breakthrough could be forever lost ._. With Boko Haram making vast territories practically ungovernable ,_,  schools are closing down and more Nigerians are daily slipping into poverty ._. 
That is why we urgently need to find solution to the crisis of insecurity ,_,  pay more attention to the education sector ,_,  reverse the shrinking investments and restore confidence in the economy ._. 
We need a holistic approach that not only tackles the immediate challenge but also deals with some of the root causes of violence in our country ._. 
We have been talking of national security and without food security ,_,  there cannot be national security ,_,  declared Agriculture Minister ,_,  Dr ._.  Akinwunmi Adesina ,_,  last year in an apt reality check ._. Those who dismiss the validity of the rebasing statistics may be missing a crucial distinction between the size of the economy and the serial failures of governance in recent times ._. 
The size of the economy is the aggregate sum of the cumulative economic activities and wealth created by all our people :_:  From the mobile phone recharge card seller who spends an entire day in the sun to make the small income with which she feeds her family to the creative ingenuity of Genevieve Nnaji ,_,  Ali Baba ,_,  Dare Art Alade et al ._.  Those are the economic dynamics captured by the NBS in their statistics ._. However ,_,  I can also understand what is driving some of the public anger ,_,  especially against the background that some government officials are already making song and dance about the routine exercise ._. 
Thanks to Mallam Abba Kyari ,_,  I have just completed the late Prof ._.  Tony Judt's last book ,_,  Ill Fares The Land which harps on the contradictions inherent in a rent -_: dependent economy such as we have in Nigeria today because it can only promote extremes of both wealth and poverty ._. 
What that means in effect is that the clear failures of the Nigerian state in the areas of security of life and property ,_,  quality of public services ,_,  infrastructure decay and growing unemployment also represent the decline in the aggregate competence of leadership in our country ._. Clearly then ,_,  while the GDP rebasing is a belated statistical acknowledgment of the economic resilience and productivity of Nigerians as a people ,_,  the persistence of abundant evidence of inequality and desperation in the land is an indictment on government at all levels ._. 
There is an even more disturbing reality that could be inferred from this exercise :_:  While the people of Nigeria have worked over the last two decades or more to make their nation richer ,_,  our leaders have perfected the squandering of riches into the directive principle of state governance and a virulent political philosophy ._. Therefore ,_,  it is commendable that our rebased economy shows that Nigeria is in the big league and even those who have questions about the methodology adopted to arrive at the conclusion can take it as merely aspirational ._. 
But even at that ,_,  such information means nothing to the man who cannot feed his family ,_,  whose children cannot go to school or access any affordable medicare ._. 
As Adam Smith put it rather succinctly in his book ,_,  Wealth of Nations ,_,  no society can surely be flourishing and happy ,_,  of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable ._. The 'Lead Story' @ 40 It was a sarcastic remark to drive home his point that I was unproductive in the week since I could not come up with any potential front page story for The Guardian on Sunday ._. 
But Mr ._. 
Ifeanyi Mbanefo ,_,  currently the oga on top ,_,  Communication and Public Relations at Nigeria Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas NLNG limited ,_,  sounded truer than he probably intended ._. 
Pointing behind me to the visitor walking into the newsroom ,_,  he said :_:  I bet that is your lead story for this week !_. 
The young lady who got that unflattering moniker which stuck is now my wife of almost 16 years and she will be 40 on Saturday ._. I guess everyone would have something nice to say about their spouse but the Bible could not be more apt with the summation :_:  He who finds a wife finds a good thing ._. 
Even before we finally got married in December 1998 ,_,  Tosin had begun to enrich my life and there are several witnesses to that ,_,  essentially because our courtship remarkably played out in the newsroom :_:  from The Guardian to Concord Press !_. I am sure Mr Tunji Bello Lagos State Environment Commissioner; Mr Sam Omatseye chairman of The Nation editorial board; Mr Kayode Komolafe THISDAY Deputy Managing Director and my friend and Bestman ,_,  Louis Odion Edo State Commissioner for Information can write interesting epistles about my fianc�e -_: turned -_: wife ._. 
So can Mr Segun Babatope who on his own without my knowledge or solicitation went to my late then prospective father -_: in -_: law's house on January 1 ,_,  1998 for a dramatic fit -_: only -_: for -_: Nollywood encounter that put in motion the process towards our wedding that year ._. Fortunately ,_,  the good virtues that other people saw in the woman I eventually married have been a blessing for me ._. 
In good and bad times ,_,  my wife and I have together taken some leaps of faith but in most instances ,_,  I just coasted along ,_,  ever trusting in her love ,_,  wisdom and strength of character ._. 
As she therefore clocks 40 on Saturday ,_,  I crave the indulgence of readers for this public appreciation ,_,  especially since she doesn't want ,_,  and there is not going to be ,_,  any ceremony to mark the day ._. 
At her insistence ,_,  the money for a get -_: together has been donated to a worthy cause ._. 
Every day ,_,  I thank God for leading me to Oluwatosin ._. 
And I am glad she accepted me !_. 
Gunmen suspected to be members of the Boko Haram sect have killed seven policemen and one civilian in an attack at Gwaram local government of Jigawa state ._. The gunmen attacked a police station ,_,  Sharia court and bank in the early hours of Wednesday during which there was an exchange of fire with the terrorists which lasted for several hours ._. The Assistant Inspector General of Police of zone 1 Kano ,_,  Tambari Yabo confirmed the incident to reporters in Dutse the Jigawa state capital ._. 
About two hundred terrorists came on motorcycles and some stolen cars attacked a police station ,_,  a bank and a sharia court in Gwaram at about 1 ._. am today ._. Yabo said Unfortunately we lost seven of men during the attack and one civilian ._. 
LAST Monday ,_,  it was my turn to respond to President Goodluck Jonathan's address at the opening ceremony of the National Conference ,_,  2014 ._. 
As was set out by the conference leadership ,_,  every delegate was expected to say something about Jonathan's speech ._. 
The great handicap was that each one of us was assigned just three minutes for a statement ._. 
Not enough time to open full hearts about the Nigerian condition ._. While many delegates spent time praising the speech ,_,  quite a significant number of delegates have also touched on some of the issues that necessitated the conference in the first place ._. 
Nigerians are obviously hurting ,_,  for a variety of often ,_,  disparate and conflicting ,_,  even adversarial reasons ._. 
I knew that three minutes won't be enough to state all that occurred to me ,_,  but I chose to write out my thought ,_,  while I then summarised the script ._. 
What you read here is the script that I wrote as my thought ,_,  and which I spoke to Goodluck Jonathan's speech of March 17th ,_,  2014 ._. Nigeria matters ._. 
We are the only African country with all attributes to become a great power :_:  size and population; arable land and water; oil and solid minerals; diverse tourist potentials and very resourceful people ,_,  with incredible self -_: assuredness ._. 
Yet ,_,  we face serious problems :_:  a deformed political structure and an economy that has not worked ,_,  especially since the mid 1980s ,_,  with the implementation of imperialist Structural Adjustment Policies SAP and neoliberal policies ._. 
They have led to de -_: industrialisation; and the transfer of public assets into the hands of private cronies ,_,  in controversial privatisation policies ._. Consequently ,_,  we have managed to create one of the most unjust societies in the world today ._. 
The National Bureau of Statistics NBS says 115million Nigerians live in poverty and 64% of our urban population lives in slums ._. 
Yet ,_,  those who now control Nigeria's wealth have spent over $6billion purchasing private jets ._. 
Nigeria's rich oligarchy consumes more champagne than their Russian counterparts ._. 
CRONY CAPITALISM is ruining our country ._. 
It is at the base of ethno -_: regional and religious rivalries ,_,  that many of the old people here assume to be the most important contradictions facing us ._. 
Extreme wealth lives side by side with mind -_: boggling poverty ,_,  deprivation and hopelessness ._. 
The World Bank recently said that two thirds of the extremely poor people of the world live in China ,_,  India ,_,  NIGERIA ,_,  Bangladesh and DR Congo !_. 
Since 1999 ,_,  a new phenomenon emerged in Nigeria ,_,  where those who have ruled our states ,_,  after eight years ,_,  have become richer than the states they governed !_. Today ,_,  Nigeria is a country of young people :_:  45% is under 15; 63% of the population is under the age of 25; while 75% is under 35 ._. 
Instructively ,_,  those aged 65 and above ,_,  are only 3% of our population ._. 
The young; urban and rural working people; women; and the physically challenged ,_,  and how we treat them ,_,  will determine Nigeria's future ._. 
23 ._. 9% of Nigerians are unemployed ,_,  but youth unemployment was at 54% by 2012 ,_,  according to the National Baseline Youth Survey Report ._. 
In May 2012 ,_,  a former minister of Youth Development announced that 67million young Nigerians were unemployed ,_,  while 80 percent of that number do not have university degrees ,_,  and are almost unemployable ._. 
Alarmingly ,_,  1 ._. 8 million graduates enter the job market annually ._. The most central problems we face are ECONOMIC; how to re -_: industrialise to create jobs for millions of young people ._. 
We will not create those jobs if we do not critically interrogate the philosophy of governance ._. 
Nigeria's bizarre form of capitalism is NOT working ._. 
Rev ._. 
Fr ._. 
George Ehusani of the Catholic Secretariat ,_,  did a study of ethno -_: religious crises in Nigeria ,_,  between 1999 and 2007 ,_,  and showed that most of them occurred between 12noon and six pm ._.  Those are the hours people would normally be at work ._. 
And most of those involved are young people ._. 
The preponderance of membership of Boko Haram is young Nigerians !_. 
Nigerians must be put to work !_. 
Faulty as the 1999 Constitution might be ,_,  let us make JUSTICIABLE Chapter II ,_,  the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy ._. 
Many of the elite groups at this National Conference have retreated into ethnic ,_,  regional and religious identities; there is scare mongering and unbridled efforts at delegitimisation of our dear country ,_,  including ill -_: concealed secessionist agendas; but the Nigerian people don't really hate themselves ._. 
Elite groups manipulate them into postures of hatred in their rivalries for power and privileges ._. Nigeria mattersI will like to return to where I started from; Nigeria matters ._. 
Our country has responsibilities to its people and the African continent ._. 
One out of every 5 Africans is a Nigerian; 20% of Africa is Nigeria and 47% of West Africa is our dear country ._. 
But neoliberal capitalism will sink us into an abyss ._. 
It has created a few billionaires ,_,  yes ._. 
But the majority of our people are in despair all over Nigeria ._. 
We must build a caring and inclusive country ,_,  not the Hobbesian state of nature ,_,  where life is nasty ,_,  brutish and short ,_,  as we have today in Nigeria ._. Finally ,_,  people have asked for restructuring of Nigeria ._. 
My suggestion is that we should return to the 12 states structure of General Yakubu Gowon ,_,  between 1967 and 1975 ._. 
There were six states in the North and six in the South ._. 
That offers a balanced basis for real development ._. 
We should then significantly reduce the exclusive legislative list and devolve more resources and responsibilities to the states ._. 
In that setting ,_,  we can conveniently have well -_: organised state police forces and even local police forces too ,_,  while the Nigeria Police Force will be in charge of cross border and federal crimes ._. 
We can also remove the friction around what Southern Nigerian groups agitate for as 'Resource Control' by giving oil producing states 50% derivation on ON -_: SHORE oil while the entire country owns revenues accruing from offshore oil fields ._. 
A corollary of these developments is to bring the state back into the development process ._. 
The 'religion' like devotion to privatisation and market forces is doing far more damage to our country ,_,  than people have bothered to study ._. We must also introduce a Development Planning regime to take control of the development process ._. 
Nigeria must deliberately overthrow the Washington Consensus and bring Nigeria's working people ,_,  patriotic intellectuals ,_,  business people dedicated to patriotic endeavours and well -_: trained and patriotically bureaucrats ,_,  to drive the development process ._. 
At the moment ,_,  our economic process is driven by agents of imperialism; and they owe more allegiance to the Washington Institutions than to our country ._. 
Wasn't one of them alleged to have made 60 Billion Naira from negotiating the cancellation of Nigerian debts under Obasanjo Surely ,_,  those are not the types that should be piloting Nigeria's economic process ._. Fulbe nomads :_:  From negative profiling to ethnic cleansingTHE killing of innocent Fulbe nomads near Keana ,_,  Nasarawa state last week ,_,  by Nigerian soldiers ,_,  was an almost predictable tragedy ._. 
The Nigerian state has been priming to kill Fulbe nomads ,_,  to satisfy the yearnings of groups of the Nigerian elite ,_,  from different parts of the country ._. 
This was the ambition of even the ruling circles in states like Benue and Plateau ,_,  at the heart of conflicts between nomadic groups and farming communities in recent years ._. 
In a place like Plateau state ,_,  urban -_: based political conflicts were deliberately taken to Fulbe nomads in the rural areas; and in many instances ,_,  Fulbe nomads' cattle were rustled ._. 
Nomads fight back with a ferocity that surprises their adversaries ._. 
Farming groups have children in elite circles and they control a tendentious Nigerian media that has systematically ,_,  negatively profiled nomads over the years ._. The Nigerian media has not covered itself in glory in reportage of conflicts between farmers and nomadic Fulbe communities ._. 
When I worked in DAILY TRUST ,_,  the profiling of Fulbe people was an issue we regularly debated and to its credit ,_,  DAILY TRUST improved its reportage ._. 
But that is not the position with most of the Southern Nigerian media ._. 
THE NATION newspaper ,_,  for example ,_,  always seemed to have a deliberate agenda to negatively profile the Fulbe in its reportage ._. 
It seems unable or unwilling to see the danger of its consistent profiling ._. 
Two Mondays ago ,_,  I spoke with Sam Omatseye ,_,  the Chairman of THE NATION's Editorial Board about the reportage of the Fulbe ._. 
It just doesn't change with THE NATION ._. 
So a few days after the massacre of innocent Fulbe nomads in Nasarawa which shocked people around the country ,_,  and ought to have made reportage more nuanced; on April 6 ,_,  THE NATION ON SUNDAY reported on its page 5 :_:  FULANI HERDSMEN KILL SIX ,_,  WOUND 14 IN TARABA ._. 
That sounded definitive ,_,  until you read the first paragraph of the story :_:  Six people lay dead yesterday in three Tiv and Jukun villages in Wukari Local Government Area of Taraba State following an attack THAT BORE SEMBLANCE WITH PREVIOUS ONES BY FULANI HERDSMEN capital mine !_.  ._. 
There was no definitive report of an attack by Fulbe nomads ,_,  but just that what happened BORE SEMBLANCE WITH PREVIOUS ONES BY FULBE NOMADS ,_,  so THE NATION CONCLUDED Fulbe Nomads were responsible for the new atrocity !_. 
But that is irresponsible journalism !_. 
Journalism's responsibility is to report the FACTS; journalism should NOT extrapolate a trend into reportage ._. 
But THE NATION did !_. 
Almost like it was pursuing an agenda against Fulbe nomads ._. Genocide in RwandaThis issue is very important ,_,  because the genocide in Rwanda ,_,  which happened 20 years ago this month ,_,  was preceded by a systematic profiling of the Tutsi; and the media ,_,  this time the radio ,_,  helped prepared the condition which facilitated the massacre of one million people !_. 
In the tragic killings in Benue ,_,  it is strange that up till this moment ,_,  not a single person has been arrested and brought for prosecution ._. 
This much was admitted by Gabriel Suswam ,_,  the Benue state governor ,_,  in the interview he gave to SUNDAY TRUST recently ._. 
It is equally instructive that Chief Paul Unongo also stated that people apprehended attacking some Tiv communities were discovered not to be Fulbe !_. 
But constantly ,_,  we read reports in newspapers of attacks by Fulani nomads ._. 
In the heightened hysteria against Fulbe nomads ,_,  even a governor suggested that the Federal Government should cleanse them from states in North Central Nigeria ._. In that respect ,_,  the Niger State Government forcibly removed Fulbe nomads and deported them to Kaduna state a few weeks ago ._. 
The killings in Nasarawa portend serious danger for Fulbe nomads and the fact that Fulbe people were separated from other ethnic groups before being killed in cold blood by the Nigerian Army ,_,  is a new departure in the criminal behaviour by agents of the Nigerian state !_. 
I do not condone criminal acts carried out by Fulbe nomads or other groups and individuals ,_,  but it is unacceptable to profile an entire people as Nigerian elite groups ,_,  especially those in power and in the media ,_,  are doing to Fulbe nomads !_. 
Maiduguri � Governors of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe facing the challenges of Boko Haram insurgency on Wednesday urged the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC not to postpone the 2015 general elections in the states ._. The call is contained in a statement jointly issued in Maiduguri by their spokespersons ._. The statement urged INEC to disregard calls by some politicians for the postponement of the elections due to the security situation in the states ._. It urged INEC to take a cue from war -_: ravaged Afghanistan where elections were recently held ,_,  in spite of threat of attacks by the Taliban terrorist group ._. INEC should take a cue from Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission which courageously held the country's presidential and provincial election last Saturday despite strong threats issued by the Taliban ._. Afghanistan was celebrated worldwide for liberating herself from the scourge of fear ,_,  thereby sending a strong signal that no threat would prevent them from choosing their leaders through democratic processes ,_,  it said ._. The statement further pointed out that the Afghan government provided adequate security for the conduct of the polls ,_,  urging the Federal Government to do same ._. INEC should as a matter of counter insurgency approach ,_,  ensure that no part of Nigeria is excluded from the election ._. NAN
Former aviation minister ,_,  Mr ._. 
Femi Fani -_: Kayode ,_,  yesterday refuted media reports suggesting that he may have dumped his party ,_,  the All Progressives Congress APC to join the ruling Peoples Democratic Party PDP ahead of the 2015 elections ._. A visit by the APC chieftain to the presidential villa ,_,  Abuja ,_,  Tuesday night where he held a closed -_: door meeting with the President Goodluck Jonathan had sparked the speculation in the media following his comment during a chat with journalists to the effect that while he would make public his next line of action at the appropriate time ,_,  he would not associate himself with a group or political party that promotes a particular religion above another ._. But in a statement he personally issued yesterday ,_,  Fani -_: Kayode explained that what he said during his interview with State House correspondents during his visit to Aso Rock bordered on principle and not about leaving his party ._. In the statement made available to LEADERSHIP ,_,  he said :_:  I have not left the APC ._. 
If I ever choose to leave the party ,_,  I will let the Nigerian public know and I will give my reasons ._. 
This has not happened ._. 
I was at the Villa the other day and what transpired there has been the subject of much online speculation ._. What I said to the media whilst there was very clear and I chose my words very carefully ._. 
Let those that are interested read those words in the newspapers rather than speculate ._. 
Other than that ,_,  I will say no more on this matter until I am ready to do so ._. Citing instances where all the APC governors from the south west had gone to the villa to attend a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan as well as when a leader of the party ,_,  General Muhammadu Buhari rtd went there recently to be honoured by President Jonathan during the centenary celebration which the APC did not support ,_,  Fani -_: Kayode argued that the said visits did not translate to the governors and the APC leader dumping their party ._. He said ,_,  What they discussed has not been made public until now ._. 
Does that make them PDP governors The Presidency belongs to every Nigerian irrespective of religious and political persuasions ._. Again ,_,  the ongoing Federal Government confab has some APC chieftains participating in it despite the fact that the party is against it ._. 
Does that mean that they have left the APC People should get real and stop speculating ._. Clarifying on what he said about not associating with a party that has strong religious affiliation ,_,  he quoted Biodun Ishola Ladepo who had written that If he were to be him Fani -_: Kayode and his party planned to field a Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket ,_,  especially in the age of Boko Haram ,_,  he would bolt faster than Hussein Bolt ,_,  even as he added that I am glad that someone is seeing things clearly ._. Urging the leadership of APC to do something about the muslim/muslim presidential ticket ,_,  Fani -_: Kayode said ,_,  This is not about leaving parties but about principle ._. 
Let us hope that the leadership of the APC sees fit to clarify this matter at the soonest and assure us all that they will do no such thing ._. 
Their silence on the matter and their refusal to rule it out is simply fuelling more speculation and dissent from within ._. When I say this I am speaking for many within the party leadership who have chosen to remain silent for obvious reasons ._. 
On Sunday March 30 ,_,  2014 ,_,  about 21 persons suspected of belonging to the Boko Haram sect were killed and many others wounded during the a reported jailbreak at the Asokoro headquarters of the Department of State Security in Abuja ._. The official account of the incident as reported in the media is that a detainee struck an operative who had brought breakfast ,_,  with his handcuff ._. 
The report did not say whether the handcuff had been locked around the detainee's wrist or had been unlocked ._. It did not say the extent to which the actions of the detainee threatened the life or safety of the operative ,_,  and whether the detainee succeeded in dispossessing the operative of his weapon if s/he carried one ._. 
The statement further said that bullets were fired at the detainee ,_,  but did not say what other detainees did to deserve being fired at or killed ._. 
Some media reports quote Ms ._. 
Marilyn Ogar ,_,  Deputy Director ,_,  Public Relations ,_,  of the State Security Service ,_,  Ms ._. 
Marilyn Ogar as saying that  ._.  the attempt by the detainee to escape made other SSS operatives on guard to fire shots to prevent others from escaping ._. A literal interpretation of this statement is that other detainees who posed no danger to the DSS or its operatives ,_,  or ,_,  who ,_,  in fact made no attempts to escape from detention were fired at to prevent them from even contemplating the possibility of fleeing !_. 
Is this what happened Preventive shooting ,_,  or ,_,  actually ,_,  preventive killing !_. No clear justification has been provided by the DSS or the Nigerian State for the killing of such a multitude of vulnerable detainees ._. 
We pose many questions to the SSS :_:  Where were the detainees when they were fired at Outside of their enclosures or within Within the precincts of the DSS facility or outside At what point were they fired at ,_,  and with what purpose To restrain their flight or to annihilate them Then ,_,  who fired at themThe DSS/SSS or the soldiers who came to assist them Were they fired at to avoid political embarrassment Did they all die immediately after the shooting or were injured persons given medical assistance There has been no clear ,_,  forthright ,_,  convincing and consistent statement from the DSS ,_,  SSS or government to justify this massacre ._. Anyone associated with the Boko Haram sect would ordinarily face considerable public prejudice given the horrifying atrocities attributed to the group; yet ,_,  it is this negative perception that renders both them as well as those wrongly associated with them so vulnerable to persecution ,_,  to being silenced ,_,  brutalized or violated capriciously ._. The death of anyone associated with this sect must be subject to the toughest scrutiny to avoid people getting away with clear homicides only by the sheer unpopularity of the victims' ascribed label ._. 
And yes :_:  Nigerian law enforcement and security agencies do understand how to leverage on unpopular stereotypes and how little sympathies exist for people associated  -_:  truthfully or falsely  -_:  to reviled groups ._. We see this every time ,_,  every where ._. 
They abound with the Police routinely saying those they extrajudicially killed were armed robbers who were trying to flee from the law ,_,  and to refresh our memory with a notorious piece of history ,_,  we recall the Apo 6 ._. 
We see the Joint Task Force JTF saying that those it killed in Baga ,_,  Maiduguri last year were terrorists ,_,  when it fired indiscriminately at unarmed civilians in revenge for the killing of an Army Lieutenant or Lance Corporal ._. Our security forces ,_,  overwhelmed by the escalating affront of extremist groups are ,_,  no doubt ,_,  under pressure ,_,  and have repeatedly acted with impunity and committed grave crimes against many innocent people ,_,  in a largely unchallenged way ._. 
Reports of extrajudicial ,_,  summary executions by government forces are clearly intensifying and ,_,  to some extent ,_,  delegitimizing what ought to be a credible fight against terrorism ._. There is some advocacy to take government forces to the International Criminal Court along with Boko Haram fighters because our government will not rein in wayward ,_,  illegitimate violence meted to innocent victims by its security forces ._. Today ,_,  the New York Times carried a story based on an Amnesty International Report that alleges that about 600 unarmed ,_,  recaptured detainees who had been earlier freed when Boko Haram fighters attacked the Giwa military barracks in Maiduguri ,_,  Borno State were re -_: arrested ,_,  and then summarily executed by soldiers in various locations in Maiduguri ._. 
Amongst the testimony gathered by Amnesty International were the voices of witnesses who described what happened when the military found 56 of those who had escaped from the Giwa barracks ._. The former detainees were in a classroom ._. 
They started screaming 'we are not Boko Haram ._. 
We are detainees !_. ' My neighbours and I saw the soldiers take the men to a place called 'no man's land ,_, ' behind the University of Maiduguri ._. 
We watched as the soldiers opened fire killing all 56 ._. 
They were killed in front of us ._. 
All of them ._. We cannot afford to be quiet when the State kills in circumstances like this ,_,  notwithstanding the extremism and violence of armed groups that has brought much gut -_: wrenching bloodshed and dislocation to our country ._. 
Our answer to extremist depravities cannot mirror and reproduce the brutishness and mindlessness we condemn ,_,  for then ,_,  we can't say we have set a standard by which we are entitled to judge and condemn others ,_,  for we can be no different from those judged ._. But more than that ,_,  we run the universal risk of exposing innocent people suffering to the injustice of stigmatization and victimization from mislabeling ._. 
That stigmatization has often led to many deaths ,_,  unfair ,_,  unfortunate deaths ._. 
Nelson Mandela ,_,  that hero of the anti -_: apartheid struggle ,_,  was once branded a terrorist by the White government in Pretoria ._. Had he been killed the way the 21 inmates in the custody of the SSS were ,_,  the world would have been denied knowledge of the truth of who Mandela really was ._. 
Who is to say whether all of those persons in SSS custody were actually Boko Haram members in a country where people are picked up randomly and hauled to face fabricated crimes In a country where security agencies are plumbing the depths of incredulity to make distorted claims of their progress in winning the war against terrorismPrisoners and detainees still have the right to life and where there is an attempt to escape detention ,_,  their lives cannot be taken whimsically ,_,  or as a retribution for the attempt to escape detention or cause political embarrassment ._. 
In the context of the location where this escape bid was reportedly launched ,_,  it is untenable to argue that there were no non -_: lethal means of preventing the escapes ._. The Nigerian Constitution guarantees the right to life ,_,  and the government is under a constitutional responsibility to thoroughly and impartially investigate the deaths of any persons who die in custody ._. 
Many international norms and instruments obligate Nigeria to undertake credible ,_,  impartial and thorough investigations into the death of any persons who die in custody ._. 
For example ,_,  Principle No 34 of the United Nations Body of Principles for the Protection All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment provides that :_: Whenever the death or disappearance of a detained or imprisoned person occurs during his detention or imprisonment ,_,  an inquiry into the cause of death or disappearance shall be held by a judicial or other authority ,_,  either on its own motion or at the instance of a member of the family of such a person or any person who has knowledge of the case ._. When circumstances so warrant ,_,  such an inquiry shall be held on the same procedural basis whenever the death or disappearance occurs shortly after the termination of the detention or imprisonment ._. 
The findings of such inquiry or a report thereon shall be made available upon request ._. 
We also urge the National Human Rights Commission ,_,  by virtue of its statutory mandate ,_,  to undertake a thorough and independent investigation into what actually happened during the jail break and ensure that the truth is not buried under the weight of what is politically expedient for the SSS to claim at this time ._. 
After this investigation ,_,  the Commission should refer any matter of human rights violation requiring prosecution to the Attorney General of Federation ._. The authors are of Access to Justice ._. 
MR Joseph Daudu ,_,  SAN is a former President of the Nigeria Bar Association ._. 
He is known for baring his mind on an issue ,_,  no matter whose ox is gored ._. 
In this interview ,_,  he spoke extensively on the on -_: going national conference ,_,  the crisis in the Rivers State Judiciary over the appointment of a Chief Judge for the state and other issues ._. Excerpt :_: What is your view on the on -_: going national conferenceThe on -_:  going conference is in my view and with respect to its organisers and attendees a farce ,_,  it will end up as an appalling fiasco ._. 
The conference was conceptualized initially as a Sovereign Conference then as a National Conference and finally as just 'Conference' ._. 
These terminologies have different constitutional and political connotations ._. With the coming into effect of the 1999 Constitution ,_,  all political ,_,  legislative and judicial authority took its root from that hallowed document ._. 
Some may have argued that the constitution was not sufficiently autochthonous and that it told a lie against itself referring to the preamble which declared that the constitution was bequeathed to the nation by the People ,_,  when it was bequeathed by the military ,_,  yet the same critics took benefit from the constitution in the guise of high political offices ,_,  etc ._. Thus it is my humble view that any political change must come at this point of time from or within the framework of the said constitution ._. 
It borders on treason and political adventurism to seek political change outside the 4 walls of the 1999 constitution ._. 
However ,_,  the constitution provides for freedom of expression and association ,_,  so it is permissible for people to come together and review or chart a way forward for the nation ._. So any group of people can meet to discuss the direction of the nation or even discuss our problems ._. 
But the real question is what is the business of government in organising a constitutional conference which people expect will lead to a positive change for the nationIs it part of its remit under the constitution it has sworn to uphold to propose change outside the ambit or contemplation of the constitution Is the conference anticipated by the current or proposed Appropriation Acts Where is the money for the conference coming from And who will account to the nation at the end of the day or implement the supposed proposals of this talk shop The answers to these questions are obvious ._. No one will account or implement ._. 
This is indeed constitutional irresponsibility and that is why the National Assembly is carrying on unperturbed with its own process of constitutional amendment ._. 
The scenario can be likened to squabbles by the wives of a rich permissive polygamist ._. The truth is that government and governance is seen by a majority of Nigerians as a wayward cash cow to be milked mercilessly for the benefit of a few so -_: called political gladiators and their chosen acolytes ._. 
That is how this conference is envisioned ._. 
Government was initially opposed to the idea ,_,  but as it has not performed as projected or expected ,_,  a school of thought is of the view that it wishes to place the conference as part of its achievements ._. Finally ,_,  with the squabbles within the conference now eclipsing the short -_: sighted objectives of government; the latter may well have begun to regret ever dabbling into this venture ._. 
In my humble view the conference is unnecessary and it is a colossal waste of precious time and resources ._. Do you think the conference will address the fundamental issues confronting the countryThe question is what are these fundamental issues bedevilling Nigeria Traditionally ,_,  they are thought to be tribalism i ._. e ._.  ethnicity corruption and indiscipline ._. 
Since independence the nation has generally produced corrupt leaders ,_,  who hid under the cover of ethnicity and sectarianism to promote their private agenda of wealth accumulation propelled by greed and indiscipline ._. Thus ,_,  in order to advance their unfortunate agenda ,_,  our leaders use the cloak and dagger tactics of divide and rule to achieve their wealth pursuit at the expense of the people ._. 
The existence of this kind of conference is a manifestation of the parasitic existence our leaders have always craved for and relished ._. 
Consequently ,_,  our problems are well known and the solution achievable without the convoking of a conference ._. Indeed ,_,  conferences of this nature and in the circumstances Nigeria finds itself are usually an avenue to entrench those ills that have plagued the nation ._. This is because all those in attendance have benefitted from the skewed system as it is and they are very unlikely to commit class suicide and advocate a real change to the system ._. What Nigeria needs is a nation that is run according to the due process of law ,_,  i ._. e ._.  the rule of law ._. 
Our leaders must recognise that they are the problems of this great nation and until we start punishing transgressors and corrupt personalities ,_,  no matter how highly placed we cannot make any progress ._. 
The problems are therefore ,_,  not with a principles of revenue allocation ,_,  zoning and allocation of political positions ,_,  federal character ,_,  adoption or non adoption of state religion ,_,  among others ,_,  the problem is simple but deadly ._. 
It is corruption ._. Fight it and you would have removed from our system the cankerworm eating the fabric of this nation ._. 
Understandably ,_,  over 90 percent of our leaders do not want a real fight against corruption ._. 
Inevitably ,_,  they will be fighting themselves ._. 
In answer to the question ,_,  the conference is a waste of time ._. 
We have already elected people into political and legislative offices to do the same work the delegates to this conference have been called upon to do ._. It is an unwarranted abdication of constitutional responsibility by the government in power ._. 
The question to ask is if Nigeria were a country without resources ,_,  will we be engaging in the unwarranted luxury of this jamboree We would not and as our leaders have no sense of duty and accountability ,_,  they can do as the like with tax payers' money ._. 
Once again ,_,  the conference is still born and will end as a colossal failure ._. How do you suggest the outcome/ recommendations of the confab be treatedThere is no lawful way for the recommendations of the conference to be implemented ._. 
Some people say that they might resort to a referendum while some say that it will be sent to the National Assembly for implementation as part of the constitution amendment process ._. 
Either way ,_,  it will still amount to a waste of time and energy ._. Indeed ,_,  in order to understand this dilemma or conundrum ,_,  let us pose a practical problem which even the elected legislators have shied away from dealing with ._. 
Nigeria is a country just about the size of Texas in the United States of America; the latter is one of the 50 States in the USA ._. 
It has only one executive and legislature i ._. e ._.  one Governor ,_,  a bi -_: cameral legislative house ,_,  a few Commissioners called Secretaries and a judicature ._. Nigeria on the other hand has a Federal Government headed by the President ,_,  a battery of ministers ,_,  heads of parastatals ,_,  a federal capital territory and all its governmental apparatus ._. The centre also has the National Assembly consisting 96 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives and an unwieldy judiciary ._. 
The 36 States have their governors ,_,  each with its host of Commissioners ,_,  there are 36 state legislations ,_,  speakers ,_,  36 Chief Judges and other paraphernalia of government ._. 
There are also 449 local government councils each with its expensive bureaucracy ._. The cost of governance alone prevents government from engaging in befitting infrastructural development projects ._. 
However ,_,  sentiment picked up from the conference is that some people may be advocating for more states and by extension an increase in the recurrent expenditure of the cost of governance ._. In reality ,_,  the sensible thing to do in the circumstances is to contract the states into eight manageable and economically viable regions ._. 
The vehicle for development should then be the Local Government Councils ._. 
Now back to the question ,_,  can conference take such an earth shaking decision as described above and cause it to be implemented ._. 
The answer is No ._.  This example should answer your question ._. Do subscribe to it being subjected to referendum or given to the National AssemblyThe answer in view of the foregoing will be neither here nor there ._. 
There is so much distrust about the whole process that it does not really matter which process or procedure the powers that be would wish to adopt as it relates to implementation ._. The truth is that the attention of the political gladiators is now firmly focussed on the 2015 general elections and there will hardly be time to consider let alone implement the recommendations of the conference ._. 
Indeed ,_,  the National Assembly has sent out its own clear signals that it is proceeding with the on -_: going amendment to the constitution ,_,  which will also not work in view of the clear divide in the political landscape ._. The present conference is neither backed up nor supported by any legislation ,_,  therefore ,_,  there is no carefully articulated procedure for implementation ._. 
The previous exercises on the other hand i ._. e ._.  the Lancaster House Conference in London of 1957 and 1958 where meetings where the Federal Constitution for an independent Nigeria was prepared the 1977 and 1988 Constituent Assemblies and the 1999 Constitutional Conference wereall constitutional talk -_: shops hinged on resolving all the problems caused by Nigeria's diversity and our inability to be fair and dispassionate in dealings with one another ._. 
These conferences to the credit of their organisers had carefully articulated and legally defined implementation procedure ._. Consequently ,_,  even if we find a formula and write it down on how to live peacefully together as a multi -_: ethnic and religious society ,_,  can we ensure proper implementation Thus the problem has never been the absence of laws and checks/balances to keep us focussed; the problem has always been in our penchant to cut corners ,_,  to fail to be bound by existing rules of the game ._. These tools cannot be written down or implemented without self -_: discipline and the collective resolve to be fair and incorruptible ,_,  especially among our leaders ._. 
If the current administration operates within the strict confines of the rules of good governance and the rule of law ,_,  it if punishes kleptocrats and looters of the treasury ,_,  if it implements even 50 percent of the rolling development plan then there will be no need for Conferences such as this ._. With the on -_: going confab ,_,  is the National Assembly right to still go ahead with the proposed constitutional amendmentThough the confab has no value whatsoever ,_,  it ought to ,_,  at least be a product of political party policy and consensus ._. 
The Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  is in power at the centre and in most of the 36 states ._. 
It has the leadership of both houses in the National Assembly ._. 
Even if there is no constitutional framework for the so called CONFAB and it is being run on the basis of our collective constitutional right of freedom of expression; there ought to be party unity on the matter ._. The desire of the National Assembly to proceed with constitutional amendment is a clear attempt to pre -_: empt the outcome of the conference and it amounts to a legislative vote of no -_: confidence in the exercise ._. 
It is also evidence that there is no party consensus on the matter of the cational conference ._. 
The whole exercise is dead on arrival ._. What is your reaction to the N4million paid each delegate to the confab ,_,  following complaints by some Nigerians that the sum is outrageousNo one knows the rationale for paying each delegate the whopping sum of N4 million even by Abuja standards ._. Of course the amount itself is outrageous and shows a total lack of preparation on the part of government in the organisation of conference ._. 
By paying a flat rate ,_,  the delegate from the FCT and the ones from Borno ,_,  Adamawa ,_,  Lagos and Port Harcourt are each paid the same amount as it is assumed albeit erroneously that their expenses and inconveniences are the same ._. 
This decision on its own represent all that is wrong with Nigeria ._. This has encapsulated our laziness ,_,  assumption that we are rich ,_,  corruption and unfairness ._. 
Finally ,_,  coming at a time that the incumbent head of the federal executive is possibly seeking re -_: election and noting that the said conference has aggregated serious political influence peddlers ,_,  some may rightly conclude that it is part of the re -_: election strategy ._. How can we effectively resolve the Boko -_: Haram issue ,_,  with accusation by the Presidency that the insurgency is being sponsoredOf course ,_,  even a toddler knows that such an enterprise can only be sponsored by agents of enemies of Nigeria whether local or international or both ._. 
That is not what government should be telling us ._. 
What government should be doing is to solve the problem ._. 
With the level of resources at its disposal it is unacceptable that government should just throw up its hand in dejection and despair mouthing what every Nigerian already knows ._. We voted the government in power to provide peace ,_,  order and good government for Nigerians and in Nigeria ._. 
Their failure to do so and their defence of internal sabotage are unacceptable and it shows that they failed to address the problem holistically ._. 
The problem can be effectively resolved by concerted government action using the template of both peaceful and strong arm tactics ._. You have maintained that corruption on the bench needed to be seriously addressed ._. 
But we have cases where forcefully retired or sacked judges have blamed their plight on their alleged refusal to do the bidding of some influential persons ,_,  be they former judicial officers or politicians or both ._. 
What does this portend for the judiciary when most often ,_,  such allegations are never investigatedAny interference with judicial officers ,_,  particularly with their ability to deliver justice timeously and in a free and fair manner is a breach of the independence of the judiciary and of the rule of law ._. 
The truth is that the judiciary is a part of the Nigerian superstructure ,_,  which is visibly riddled with corruption ._. 
It i ._. e ._.  judiciary cannot therefore ,_,  claim that it is insulated from the corruption that pervades the larger society or that only a few of its members are involved in corrupt practices ._. Again ,_,  it is possible that a few Judges may have found themselves as scapegoats of the system ,_,  but any judge who perceives himself as having been unfairly or unlawfully treated in the matter of discipline has the avenue of the courts to seek redress from ._. 
The sky is the limit at least up to the Supreme Court ._. Even though the Rivers Chief Judge case has just gone to court ,_,  but is a state governor obligated to pick as a CJ ,_,  anybody recommended by the National Judicial Commission ,_,  NJC Does a state governor have a choice in the matter ,_,  in view of a Federal High Court ,_,  Port Harcourt ,_,  which held that all NJC can do is just to recommend and nothing moreI cannot speak much on this matter as I participated in the matters in court leading to the present state of affairs ._. 
All I will say here is that the judgment of the Federal High Court ,_,  Port Harcourt by the Hon ._. 
Akanbi FJ is correct until set aside on appeal ,_,  that is if the NJC appeals and its appeal is considered meritorious ._. 
Until then ,_,  the sound legal analysis provided by the learned and trial judge remains the law ._. The installation or appointment by the state governor of the incumbent Chief Judge is an off -_: shoot of the judgment of the Federal High Court ._. 
If the NJC is dissatisfied with any of the steps flowing from the judgment ,_,  its remedy available to it under section 6 -_: 6 -_: d of the 1999 Constitution is to go to court and not engage in strong arm tactics to declare the perceived interpretation by the state governor of the judgment of the Federal High Court as wrong ._. 
That is the constitutional path that the NJC must follow ._. It cannot and should not be seen to be engaging in brigandage against the rule of law when it ought to be the repository of such good behaviour ._. 
The NJC when compared to the Federal High Court or any other court of law is an inferior tribunal ._. It is not above the law and lacks the capacity to adjudicate on the steps taken by the governor of Rivers State pursuant to or in compliance with the judgment of the Federal High Court ._. 
Only another superior court can engage in that exercise ._. 
Any other step ,_,  such as suspending the lawful appointee to that office amounts to a vicious assault on the rule of law that the NJC is meant to protect ._. 
Penultimate Sunday's attempted jail -_: break at the headquarters of the Department of the State Security Service DSS should compel another sober look at the security challenges posed by the activities of Boko Haram ._. According to the DSS ,_,  an operative ,_,  who was on a mission to provide breakfast for the detainees ,_,  was attacked by some of the Boko Haram elements in custody and that triggered what would become a serious security breach close to the presidential villa ._. 
By the time the last shot was fired ,_,  21 of the detainees were reported dead while two DSS operatives were injured ._. Since the unfortunate incident ,_,  there has been a stream of questions in the public sphere about its far -_: reaching security implications :_:  was it just a mere jailbreak or indeed a serious national security breachHow and why were the detainees able to muster the guts to withstand the combined forces of DSS and the military for even a few hours In what condition were the suspected Boko Haram insurgents being detained Did external forces play any role in the incident Why should such potentially dangerous elements be detained so close to the presidential villaThese and many other pertinent questions are begging for answerssince the public is legitimately worried as this incident follows the tragic trend of Boko Haram deadly attacks on military and police formations as well as other civilian targets in different locations in the country ._. 
The main concern is that if Boko Haram insurgents could be audacious enough to take on the security agents in such a fortified territory close to the seat of power ,_,  is there any ground that is safe fromthe murderous activities of the insurgents That is a question that should worry those who superintend the national security landscape as they seek answers for what happened ._. It is indeed ironic that this incident took place at the DSS headquarters because not a few security experts have stressed the centrality of intelligence in the war against terror ._. 
And in managing this beat ,_,  the DSS has done a fairly good job under very difficult situations ._. 
We are particularly aware of unreported cases of calamities that have been prevented through the diligence of the DSS while the leadership of the service has been professional in the manner it has handled what has become a rather delicate assignment ._. 
And just like the military and the police ,_,  the DSS has also lost a number of its operatives in the prosecution of this anti -_: terrorism war ._. However ,_,  despite these gallant efforts ,_,  expectations are still very high on the part of the public that is deserving of security provided by the state and the role of the DSS is considered to be crucial in this circumstance ._. 
Incidents such as the one recorded at the headquarters of DSS would therefore not bolster public confidence ._. 
This is why the DSS and indeed the whole of the defence and security establishment should rigorously interrogate the issues thrown up by the unfortunate incident ._. 
In doing so ,_,  the DSS would need a good dose of public support ,_,  as the war againstterror is a collective one for all peace -_: loving citizens ._. It is noteworthy that the DSS had on March 3paraded at their headquarters seven suspected BokoHaram members alleged to have killed Sheikh Adam Albani ,_,  a Zaria -_: based prominent Muslim cleric who had been very critical of the sect ._. 
While there has been no confirmation that any of those suspects was involved in the latest breach ,_,  it has nonetheless underscored the fact the necessity for a change of operational tactics ._. 
In specific terms ,_,  there may be a need to reconsider having a detention centre for terror suspects close to the presidential villa ._. 
The process of putting those in custody on trial should also be hastened in the interest of justice which in itself is a necessary precondition for peace ._. 
Opening a modern supermarket in a city under threat from an Islamist insurgency ,_,  with the added uncertainty of wobbly public power supply ,_,  may sound like a retailer's nightmare ._. 
But what if that city stands on one of the oldest trade crossroads in Africa ,_,  offering a major chunk of one of the largest and fastest -_: growing retail markets on the continentSmall wonder then that major retail investors like South African grocer Shoprite and Wal -_: Mart unit Massmart Holdings are opening stores in Kano ,_,  the northern commercial hub of Nigeria ,_,  Africa's number one oil producer ,_,  and since Sunday ,_,  its largest economy ._. 
I always want to be bold enough to say ,_,  you can't be in Nigeria without being in Kano ,_,  Massmart Holdings' Africa Director Mark Turner told Reuters in Johannesburg at the Reuters Africa Summit this week ._. 
Nigeria ,_,  along with Angola and Kenya ,_,  is a strategic target market for the Wal -_: Mart subsidiary ._. Kano is a dusty centuries -_: old Sahel belt metropolis that once offered gold ,_,  salt ,_,  slaves ,_,  leather and famed indigo -_: dyed textiles in its teeming markets at the end of an ancient caravan route linking Libya to black Africa south of the Sahara ._. 
Now ,_,  amid banner signs proclaiming lower prices you can trust ,_,  Kano consumers can wheel their carts between shelves replete with commercial brands from across the globe in a brand -_: new ,_,  air -_: conditioned Shoprite supermarket ,_,  anchoring a larger $85 million shopping mall development in the city ._. In the coming weeks ,_,  Massmart will join Shoprite by opening one of its Game household appliance stores in the same Ado Bayero Mall ,_,  named after the emir of Kano State capital ._. 
The mall is designed to house 85 shops and will be among Nigeria's biggest ._. 
But the presence of armed and uniformed guards searching vehicles ,_,  opening boots ,_,  checking the underside for explosives with mirrors and frisking all shoppers is a sign that this particular mall location faces unusual security challenges ._. 
Despite being far from Maiduguri ,_,  the epicentre of a bloody five -_: year insurrection against the Nigerian state waged by Islamist sect ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  mostly in the North -_: east ,_,  Kano has also suffered the insurgency's impact ._. Bombings and shootings by Boko Haram militants killed at least 185 people ,_,  mostly Muslim civilians ,_,  in Kano in January 2012 ._. 
Explosions in July last year killed 11 people ,_,  and police and military roadblocks are now a feature of life in the city ._. 
We cannot wish away the fact that there are security concerns ,_,  Mohammed Hayatu -_: Deen ,_,  the Maiduguri -_: born entrepreneur and banker who chairs the group developing the Kano mall ,_,  said ._. The hulking power plant standing alongside the mall building  -_:  capable of producing nearly 5 ,_, 000 kilowatts  -_:  is a testimony to another challenge :_:  guaranteeing uninterrupted electricity in a country whose power deficit is notorious and where the rumble of the generator starting up is as familiar as the roar of traffic ._. 
Power and security are just like food and water ,_,  you can't survive without them ,_,  said another local businessman working on the mall ._. 
He asked not to be named ,_,  but his words encapsulate problems that are some of the biggest brakes to investment and growth not just in Nigeria ,_,  but in Africa as a whole ._. But despite the resilient optimism ,_,  Kano's commerce and industry have suffered from the Boko Haram insurgency and from restrictions to combat it like curfews and roadblocks ._. 
Tourists' visit to the city's historic sites has also dwindled ._. 
Foreign souvenir -_: seekers are rare now at the five centuries old Kofar Mata indigo dye pits ,_,  famed for the distinctive blue cloth that was a feature of the trans -_: Sahara trade ._. 
We have no capital to develop ,_,  said one of the dyers ,_,  Haruna Baffa ,_,  30 ._. 
But Hayatu -_: Deen was confident the arrival of more tenants at the Ado Bayero mall would have a dynamising effect ._. 
Nothing succeeds like success ,_,  he said ._. 
A leading Islamic group in the country has accused the military of summarily executing Muslims in the name of counter -_: terrorism ._. The Jama'atu Nasril Islam JNI ,_,  the umbrella group of Muslim organisations in the country said followers of the faith had become endangered species ,_,  murdered and maimed indiscriminately in the guise of fighting terrorism ._. The dimension of extra -_: judicial killing of Muslims by the military on a mere whim of unsubstantiated suspicion leaves much to be desired ,_,  it said in a statement signed by its secretary -_: general ,_,  Khalid Aliyu ._. According to the AFP ,_,  the JNI's accusation ,_,  which follows claims that troops summarily executing hundreds of suspected Islamist fighters ,_,  came after a military operation in Nasarawa State last Thursday ._. The state government said scores of Fulani tribesmen ,_,  a mainly Muslim ethnic group primarily made up of cattle herders ,_,  were killed as troops tried to disarm locals and enforce a peace deal ._. The JNI said 15 people died ,_,  adding that the incident was the latest example of orchestrated state violence where innocent Muslims were mercilessly massacred ._. 
Tit -_: for -_: tat violence between the Fulani and farmers has been commonplace in recently times ._. The violence ,_,  which has claimed more than 10 ,_, 000 lives since 1992 ,_,  according to Human Rights Watch ,_,  has been attributed to disputes over grazing rights but ethnicity and religion have also been blamed ._. Defence spokesman ,_,  Chris Olukolade ,_,  rejected the JNI's claims as spurious and inflammatory ._. According to him ,_,  the Nigerian military and other security agencies do not have any policy ,_,  agenda or plans to perpetrate massacre or extra -_: judicial killing of law abiding citizens ,_,  he said in an emailed statement ._. 
Contrary to the false claims ,_,  no law abiding individual ,_,  faith ,_,  ethnic group or organisation is being targeted as alleged by JNI ._. It is unfortunate that the unjust imputation is coming from a respectable and responsible organisation like JNI ._. The military had previously rejected claims from Amnesty that troops had executed hundreds of suspected Boko Haram militants after a jail break in the North -_: eastern city of Maiduguri on March 14 ._. The JNI ,_,  headed by the Sultan of Sokoto ,_,  also referred to the incident ,_,  as painful and unacceptable ,_,  asking whether Nigeria had a grand agenda against Muslims ._. Muslim leaders ,_,  including the JNI's Aliyu ,_,  in February voiced fears about apparent religious profiling after a wave of mass arrests of Muslims in southern Nigeria on suspicion of Boko Haram links ._. Aliyu told AFP at the time :_:  It profiling could result in a repeat of the events leading to the civil war if the north decides to go for tit -_: for -_: tat ._. 
The Nigerian Embassy in Congo Town ,_,  a suburb of Monrovia was a bloody scene Tuesday ,_,  8 April ,_,  when a group of Nigerians and their descendants in Liberia stormed the embassy premises ,_,  demanding the resignation of the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Nigeria accredited here ,_,  Ms ._. 
Chigozie F -_: Obi Nnadozie ._. The protesters held placards in front of the Nigeria House ,_,  calling on the Federal Government to immediately recall Ambassador F -_: Obi Nnadozie from Liberia ._. The protest ,_,  which had earlier commenced peacefully ,_,  turned bloody after the arrival of the Police Support Unit PSU of the Liberia National Police ._. 
Some of the protesters were wounded on the head during scuffle with the police ,_,  while others sustained minor injuries on their hands and back ._. Nigerians here under the umbrella body ,_,  Nigerian Community and Descendants Union of Liberia NCDUL described Ambassador F -_: Obi Nnadozie as the most corrupt and wicked person the Federal Government of Nigeria had ever sent to Liberia ._. The spokesperson for the group ,_,  Pastor Vincent Abuka said ,_,  the Nigerian Ambassador ,_,  without any evidence ,_,  collectively branded Nigerians and their descendents in Liberia as terrorists and Boko Haram insurgents ,_,  thereby circumscribing and mortgaging the safety and security of Nigerians and descendants here ._. According to Pastor Abuka ,_,  the alleged statement by the ambassador against fellow Nigerians here now forms the basis of recent assertion by a top Liberian security operative that Nigerian businessmen are Boko Haram operatives ._. The protestors ,_,  however ,_,  refused to name the top Liberian security officer ,_,  who allegedly made the statement ._. 
They also claimed the ambassador usually denied and obstructed the repatriation and conveyance of corpses of deceased Nigerians back home for burial as custom demands ._. Her actions often frustrate and compound the sorrow of relatives and survivors; this behavior has been unheard of in Liberia ,_,  one protester said ._. They also alleged that Ambassador F -_: Obi Nnadozie compiled list of some Nigerians and their descendants and forwarded same to the Ministry of Justice of Liberia to have them investigated by the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization in Monrovia on allegations that they were either illegal residents or improperly naturalized as Liberians ._. They furthered that the intent of the ambassador is to have the citizenship of naturalized Liberians of Nigerian descent revoked by the Government of Liberia ._. According to them ,_,  the Nigerian Ambassador wrote and circulated to the Government of Liberia and general Liberian public information that immigrant Nigerians who took citizenship in Liberia are in error unless they first revoke their Nigerian citizenship by and through the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria ._. They said this action poses a serious security threat to all naturalized Liberians of Nigerian descent ._. 
The protestors also accused Ambassador F -_: Obi Nnadozie of collecting US$10 from each Nigerian here as registration fee at the embassy when registration of Nigerians had be done free of charge during the tenure of previous ambassadors ._. The aggrieved Nigerians said charges levied against the ambassador were only part of a long roll of complaints against her administration in Liberia ,_,  adding that more grievances will be disclosed subsequently ._. 
Meanwhile ,_,  all efforts by the NewDawn to get the side of Ambassador Ms ._. 
Chigozie F -_: Obi Nnadozie were unsuccessful as staffers of the embassy refused to talk to the press ._. 
CLEEN Foundation says the security situation in the country is seen as a reflection of the failure of the Nigerian state to protect its citizens ._. Electoral violence is most likely to occur in 15 Nigerian states during the 2015 general elections ,_,  a research by a non -_: governmental organisation has shown ._. CLEEN Foundation ,_,  a non -_: governmental organisation that promotes public safety ,_,  security ,_,  and access to justice ,_,  on Wednesday in Abuja listed 15 states as the most volatile with high security risk during the forthcoming 2015 election ._. The organization in its report titled 'Third Security Threat Assessment' ,_,  noted that the security situation in the country could be seen as a reflection of the failure of the Nigerian state to protect its citizens ._. The states listed as most volatile are Nasarawa ,_,  Plateau ,_,  Benue ,_,  Borno ,_,  Yobe ,_,  Adamawa ,_,  Taraba ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  Zamfara ,_,  Rivers ,_,  Ebonyi ,_,  Enugu ,_,  Imo ,_,  Ekiti and Osun ._. Three of these states  -_:  Adamawa ,_,  Borno ,_,  and Yobe  -_:  are already under emergency rule due to the activities of the terrorist Boko Haram group ._. Some others like Plateau ,_,  Benue ,_,  Nasarawa ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  and Zamfara have recently witnessed killings of hundreds of people by unidentified armed men ,_,  as well as through communal and ethno -_: religious violence ._. 
The latest being the killing of over 100 people in a Zamfara community on Saturday by unidentified gunmen on motorcycles ._. In an earlier assessment in July 2013 ,_,  the organisation had listed Borno ,_,  Rivers ,_,  Bauchi ,_,  Plateau ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  Benue ,_,  Nasarawa ,_,  Delta ,_,  Sokoto ,_,  Adamawa ,_,  and Yobe as the most volatile states ._. Parameters for categorisationThe organization stated that the parameters used for the categorization include :_:  history of violence ,_,  degree of control by incumbent and relationship with the federal Government ,_,  stability of internal state party politics ,_,  existence of terrorists and militants ,_,  as well as communal and religious conflict ._. Others include zoning arrangement ,_,  bid for second term by the incumbent governor ,_,  and jostle for federal and state legislative positions ._. The foundation also listed proliferation of arms and increased activities by armed groups as major risk factors towards the 2015 election ._. It also listed 11 states as mid -_: volatile ._. 
These are Kogi ,_,  Niger ,_,  Bauchi ,_,  Gombe ,_,  Katsina ,_,  Sokoto ,_,  Kano ,_,  Abia ,_,  Anambra ,_,  Delta ,_,  and Akwa Ibom ._. The organisation categorised the remaining 10 states including Lagos ,_,  Ondo ,_,  and Sokoto as low -_: volatile or stable states ._. 
It ,_,  however ,_,  said Ekiti and Osun oscillate between most volatile and mid -_: volatile groups ._. CLEEN Foundation said the threat assessment will run quarterly till June; every two months after June; and then fortnightly by 2015 ._. In 2011 ,_,  Nigeria experienced post -_: election violence that led to the death of many citizens including National Youth Service Corps members posted to various states ._. In states like Kaduna ,_,  the post -_: election violence left over 4 ,_,  000 persons displaced and several houses destroyed and burnt ._. 
This also prompted the Kaduna State government to disburse N140 million to the displaced person ._. Many of the victims of the communal clashes and election violence including women and children were reportedly hacked to death ,_,  shot ,_,  or burnt alive based on their ethnic identity or political beliefs ._. RecommendationsTo prevent violence during the 2015 elections ,_,  CLEEN Foundation made some recommendations ._. It recommended rapid response to humanitarian crisis in the North East and concerted checks to reduce inflow of small arms into Nigeria ._. It also said election related stakeholders including security agencies ,_,  Independent National Electoral Commission ,_,  INEC ,_,  and political groups must commence preparation for the 2015 election and mainstream conflict management in their plans ._. 
The probe into Jacob Zuma's Nkandla private residence ,_,  a bid to combat the rise in rhino poaching ,_,  killings in CAR and corruption in Uganda are among today's stories in the African press  ._. In South Africa ,_,  financial paper BusinessDay reports that National Assembly speaker Max Sisulu has decided to call an ad hoc committee to consider President Jacob Zuma's response to allegations that hundreds of millions of rand of taxpayers' money were used to fund upgrades to his Nkandla private residence ._. Yesterday ,_,  Parliament issued its first official statement ,_,  saying that the panel would be formed ._. While the committee is not expected to decide to impeach Zuma because the majority of its members will be selected from his African National Congress party ,_,  it will give credibility to Parliament's democratic processes ,_,  says BusinessDay ._. Last month ,_,  the Public Protector ,_,  Thuli Madonsela ,_,  found that Zuma had benefited improperly from the millions spent so far on the upgrade at Nkandla ._. 
The total expenditure is expected to exceed 17 million euros ._. The committee will have 12 members ,_,  seven from the ANC ,_,  two from the opposition Democratic Alliance ._. 
The Congress of the People and Inkatha Freedom Party will each nominate one MP ,_,  and the final member will be selected from the smaller political parties ._. 
They are to report to parliament by the end of April ._. BusinessDay's science pages report that South Africa and Mozambique are to sign a biodiversity agreement in a bid to curb rhino poaching ._. Cooperation from Mozambique is critical because the country shares a long border with the Kruger National Park ,_,  the centre of the recent escalation in rhino poaching  -_:  from an average of 15 a year before 2008 to the record 1 ,_, 004 rhinos lost last year ._. A total of 277 rhinos have been poached in South Africa so far this year  -_:  166 in the Kruger park ._. 
Animal experts say if the situation is not rectified ,_,  rhinos could be extinct in the wild by mid -_: century ._. The front page of the Sowetan reports that less than 20 per cent of South Africa's top management positions are occupied by black Africans ,_,  according to the latest report from the Commission for Employment Equity ._. Blacks represent 75 per cent of the economically active population of the country ,_,  whereas whites represent less than 11 per cent ._. The front page of the Kenyan Daily Nation is dominated by killings in the Central African Republic ,_,  and in Nigeria ._. The Nairobi -_: based paper says the first European Union troops arrived in the CAR yesterday ,_,  hours before today's vote on a UN resolution which is expected to authorise the deployment of peacekeepers ._. 
Police in the capital ,_,  Bangui ,_,  say renewed sectarian violence killed at least 30 people on Tuesday ._. In Nigeria ,_,  scores of Islamist gunmen attacked a police station ,_,  a court and a bank in northern Nigeria yesterday ,_,  killing seven officers and a civilian ,_,  according to police sources ._. The raid in the town of Gwaram in Jigawa state began at midnight Universal Time and sparked an hours -_: long shootout with the security forces ,_,  said Tamari Yabo ,_,  the assistant inspector -_: general of police in charge of the region ._. Boko Haram Islamists have carried out dozens of attacks in surrounding areas ,_,  but Jigawa itself has up to now been spared much of the violence ._. Across the city ,_,  at the Nairobi Standard ,_,  the main front page story is a lot more upbeat ._. 
Alongside a smiling picture of little Satrin Osinya ,_,  the boy whose mother died in last month's attack on Mobasa's Likoni Church ,_,  we read that Satrin has fully recovered from surgery to remove a bullet from his head ,_,  and is expected to be discharged from hospital later today ._. In Uganda ,_,  the front page of the Daily Monitor is fairly grim ._. 
There we learn that evidence of corruption at the Uganda Revenue Authority ,_,  involving the loss of billions of shillings to tax evasion ,_,  fraud and unexplained payments to ghost suppliers ,_,  has been uncovered by the Auditor General ._.

Yaounde � Cameroon has announced a special polio vaccination campaign for all children after half a dozen cases were identified ._. There are fears that children fleeing dangerous situations in neighboring countries ,_,  such as terrorist violence in Nigeria  -_:  one of a few nations which have not eradicated polio  -_:  are spreading the virus ._. Minister of Health Andre Mama Fouda said the whole country needs to be on alert to protect every child from the crippling and potentially fatal virus ._. Fouda said although officials thought they could declare the country polio free ,_,  they unfortunately detected four cases of the wild polio virus in the west and then three others were also identifed  -_:  indicating virus is spreading ._. Some of the cases were reported in children fleeing northeast Nigeria  -_:  where Boko Haram militants are committing acts of random violence ._. Professor Tetani Ekwe ,_,  an official with Cameroon's Ministry of Public Health ,_,  told VOA that surveillance on Cameroon's border with Nigeria has been increased ._. He said Cameroon has reinforced its system of epidemiological surveillance in order to try to eradicate the virus ._. According to the World Health Organization ,_,  Nigeria accounts for 77 percent of polio cases in the world and to make the situation worse ,_,  northern Nigeria suspended its vaccination program for eight months last year ._. After an international drive in 1988 ,_,  Polio had been eradicated in all countries except Nigeria ,_,  Afghanistan and Pakistan ._. 
It has since been reintroduced in the Horn of Africa ,_,  Syria and Cameroon ._. Polio attacks the brain and spinal cord causing paralysis and is easily spread ._. 
It mainly affects children in the first 5 years of life ._. 
There is no cure ,_,  but is easily prevented with either oral or injectable vaccine ._. Minister of Health Mama Fouda said given the resurgence in Polio cases ,_,  all children in Cameroon must be vaccinated ._. He called on all parents with children less than five years of age  -_:  regardless of their national origin  -_:  to open their doors to vaccination teams or take their children to the nearest hospital ._. Government officials are also calling on traditional rulers ,_,  village chiefs and religious leaders to assist by encouraging their communities to get vaccinated and report all suspected cases ._. There are pockets of resistance to the polio vaccination drive due to misinformation about the safety of the vaccine ,_,  according to health activist ,_,  Mbassi Paul ._. He said resistance is a deeply rooted problem in Cameroon particularly in the Christian community ._. The World Health Organization says worldwide ,_,  the number of polio cases has reached 339 so far this year  -_:  almost double the number for the same period last year ._. 
The United States said it would support the Independent Electoral Commission and the civil society organisations in the area of voter education as a build up to general elections in 2015 ._. Its Ambassador to Nigeria ,_,  Mr James Entwistle ,_,  made this promise during an interactive session with the management ,_,  staff and students of the University of Jos in in Jos on Thursday ._. He said the general elections would be an important test for Nigeria and urged Nigerians to brace to the challenge ._. He stated that the US would lend its support to complement Nigeria's efforts to succeed in the exercise but would not dictate to Nigeria ._. One thing the two countries have in common is big and vibrant democracies and we are looking forward to Nigeria having a great democratic exercise in 2015 ._. We will support the electoral commission and the civil society in the area of voters' education ._. He called on journalists to tell politicians when they come seeking for votes to make a pledge that they will not advocate ,_,  support or condone violence before ,_,  during and after the elections ._. The radio and televisions have a great role to play here during the period before and after the elections ._. I encourage the media to make the retinue of politicians who want the peoples' votes to commit themselves on the radio ,_,  television and the waves that they will promote non -_: violence ,_,  he said ._. Entwistle said the establishment of businesses in Nigeria by some big US companies was a sign that Americans have found Nigeria conducive to do business ._. The ambassador said that the US had close relationship with Nigeria in tackling security challenges and would continue with the collaboration ._. The US will be enjoying a close cooperation with Nigeria during its Presidency of United Nations Security Council ._. On Boko Haram ,_,  the ambassador said there was very high security cooperation between Nigeria and US Government in tackling the insurgency ._. He stated that his country had been sharing its experiences on insurgency with Nigeria except that Boko Haram was a challenging one ._. According him ,_,  separating the insurgents and civilians had been the toughest test for the military but assured that US would continue to help Nigeria anyway it could ._. Prof ._.  Hayward Mafuyai ,_,  the Vice Chancellor ,_,  University of Jos ,_,  said Nigeria and U ._. S ._.  had a long standing ,_,  mutually beneficial relationship ._. This symbiotic relationship is further strengthened by the establishment of a Bi -_: National Commission which provides a veritable platform for the countries to promote their mutual interests ._. It is heartwarming to note that the United States Government has been quite supportive at the level of staff training and development of the university ._. Many academic staff of the university enjoyed some training opportunities with funds provided by the U ._. S ._.  government ,_,  he added ._.  NAN
The recent furore raised over the possibility of the All Progressives Congress APC ,_,  presenting the electorate a Muslim -_: Muslim presidential ticket in the 2015 elections is a classical case of solution looking for problem ._. 
When solution looks for problem ,_,  it doesn't take long for it to find it ._. 
And ,_,  moreover ,_,  if those within do not see it ,_,  some people outside will gladly help create one for them ._. The demand or ,_,  more correctly ,_,  the happenstance of a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket is by no means a negation of the Federal character principle in the popularly elective political arena ,_,  where it will actually have made no sense at all; but then neither is the current campaign against it an indication of the superior sensitivity of the campaigners ._. It will appear that of these campaigners ,_,  there are at least three groups that will have reason to oppose the emergence of a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket ,_,  especially the one pairing General Muhammadu Buhari and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in the All Progressives Congress APC ._. One ,_,  politicians from the South West who are uncomfortable with the fact of Tinubu as Yoruba Leader may wish to shoot down a promising proposition that looks like the winning combination ._. 
And if Yoruba leadership is still a contested proposition ,_,  the vice -_: presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria going to Tinubu will have put a definitive end to it ._. 
It is therefore little wonder and perhaps not for nothing that the call against such a ticket first emanated from the South West ._. Two ,_,  opposition to a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket may be an idea advanced by those who wish to oppose a particular candidature without specifying which or even appearing to do so ._. 
Thus ,_,  those opposed to a Buhari presidency will see their cause served by opposition to APC's reputed ticket ._. 
And they have good reasons ._. 
Despite Buhari's soaring popularity in the North ,_,  the ticket will need an Asiwaju to make it click in the South West; and in spite of Tinubu's political leadership of the Yoruba block ,_,  a ticket with him without Buhari is a probably nonstarter in the North ._. 
Those with a candidate in the North other than Buhari and those with a candidate in the South other than Tinubu will oppose the emergence of the Muslim -_: Muslim ticket on account of their own preferred candidates; but ,_,  in doing so ,_,  they may wish to hide this behind some nebulous insistence on sensitivity to Christian feelings ._. Three ,_,  those interested in a PDP victory within the APC -_:  -_: and there are many of them -_:  -_: and without will ,_,  for obvious reasons ,_,  oppose a Buhari -_: Tinubu ticket because they instinctively know it will be the pair to beat ._. 
But there is a paradox here ,_,  because it appears they don't even believe in their own logic ._. 
If it is true ,_,  as former aviation minister Chief Femi Fani -_: Kayode has been saying that such a ticket will not win ,_,  the government and its supporters should have been encouraging its emergence so that Jonathan can easily coast to victory ._. 
But as we have seen ,_,  they are busy doing everything to prevent it ._. It is perhaps no coincidence that less than a week after originating ,_,  making and publicising the Muslim -_: Muslim accusation against the APC and seeking to make an Everest out of a Mariana Trench ,_,  and even reviving the Janjaweed and Boko Haram appellations ,_,  Fani -_: Kayode was reportedly back where he belonged -_:  -_: in the People's Democratic Party PDP ,_,  on behalf of which ,_,  it is now safe to presume ,_,  he made the accusation in the first place ._. It was a pity he couldn't even wait for the seed of his pet project to germinate and cause the expected -_:  -_: and intended -_:  -_: havoc within the ranks of the opposition ._. 
An embarrassing cut like this ,_,  from within ,_,  will have caused greater pain ,_,  festered and lingered on for longer and drawn a lot more blood than the ill -_: disguised tantrums of a departing partisan mole of a political opponent ._. But what really is wrong with the Muslim -_: Muslim ticket that they hailed in 1993 but over which they were today raising so much hell Some ,_,  like Fani -_: Kayode ,_,  have said that fielding a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket will offend the Christian community in Nigeria ,_,  as if it was the Christian community of Dahomey that elected MKO Abiola on June 12 ,_,  1993 ._. 
At any event ,_,  he hasn't shown how ,_,  and it is indeed difficult to see what ,_,  or how any ,_,  right of Christians will be violated by such a ticket ._. 
The primary objective of a presidential or any kind of ticket is not to please or offend Christians or Muslims :_:  it is to win an election ._. 
If Buhari and Tinubu pair up and stand for election on the presidential ticket ,_,  they will not have infringed on any person's rights ._. 
And they will win ._. 
They will only have infringed on people's rights if ,_,  after the election ,_,  they favour their faith at the expense of other faiths ._. Accepting this is not just a question of mere political correctness nor is insisting on it in today's Nigeria being blind to realism; because something can be right without necessarily being realistic ,_,  and it can also be unrealistic without being wrong ._. At any event ,_,  APC cannot ,_,  and nor can any other party ,_,  please the adherents of all religions ,_,  or even please all the adherents of any one religion ._. 
And it should never be its purpose to try to do so ._. 
There are Muslims and Christians in other parties -_:  -_: in the PDP ,_,  for instance -_:  -_: and they are no less devout adherents of their faiths; and ,_,  presumably ,_,  nothing APC does will please them or make them approve of it as a party ._. 
In view of this ,_,  should APC then disband in order not to offend themIf only we can drop our religious prejudices ,_,  there are many personalities in this country today who ,_,  out of fear of God or possession of principled humanism ,_,  are capable of leading this nation out of pettiness; and making us forget about the silliness of some of the permutations of balancing a ticket ._. 
Isn't it time this nation went beyond our current lamentable chauvinism And what a pity it is that advancement in our socio -_: political development is acknowledged ,_,  accepted and celebrated only when it can be exploited on the altar of ethnicity ._. 
Why should a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket be acceptable to the nation at one time and not be acceptable at another What we should really be looking for in our future leaders should be competence ,_,  positive honesty ,_,  public spiritedness and capacity for justice ._. And today ,_,  if Alhaji Balarabe Musa were to pair up with Alhaji Muhammadu Maishanu ,_,  that personification of honesty and integrity in Bauchi ,_,  on the presidential ticket of some improbable political party ,_,  that would be a ticket everyone should drop everything to campaign for ,_,  even though both of them are Muslim ,_,  and they are as much Northern as they are inflexible paragons of probity ._. 
They inspire such confidence in people and possess such contentment as will shame a man; and they are incapable of committing injustice; and with either of them ,_,  no atom of public resources entrusted to him will ever get missing till the Day of Judgment ._. Or if Sunday Awoniyi were alive ,_,  a presidential ticket with him and His Grace John Cardinal Onaiyekan -_:  -_: if the Pontiff would allow -_:  -_: would have been the ticket to support despite the fact that both of them were/are Christian -_:  -_: the latter a Catholic cardinal ,_,  the former a late ,_,  un -_: canonised Baptist saint -_:  -_: and not only would they have been from the North ,_,  they would have been from the same Kogi state; and both would have been Yoruba !_. 
That would have been a ticket of competence and God -_: consciousness every patriotic Nigerian -_:  -_: Muslim ,_,  Christian ,_,  pagan ,_,  agnostic or atheist -_:  -_: in full possession of his senses ought to support ._. And if one found a ticket of Professor Sam Aluko and Genera Ishola Williams presented as presidential and vice presidential aspirants ,_,  who wouldn't have voted for them Both were/are competent ,_,  Christian ,_,  God -_: fearing and Yoruba; and in their hands the nation will be safe and the economy efficiently managed ._. 
What more can we ask of our leadersAs we can see ,_,  the best qualification for a president is the possession of the qualities required by the moment -_:  -_: competence ,_,  integrity ,_,  honesty ,_,  team spirit ,_,  public spiritedness and ability to lead by example; and for the vice president ,_,  it is his competence and faithfulness so that he can succeed and be seen as a good future president ._. For capacity to win ,_,  look to their popularity ,_,  breadth of appeal and state -_: carrying power on polling day ._. 
And important ,_,  not for winnability but for the stability of the ticket ,_,  is their compatibility ._. 
No doubt ,_,  the factors to look for in all aspirants on a ticket are many but the most important is certainly not their religion but their competence ._. While at one time or the other ,_,  issues of race ,_,  religion ,_,  gender ,_,  political ideology and ethnicity have been important considerations in deciding the composition of leadership and in the political development of some of the advanced democracies that Nigeria is copying today ,_,  these were only for short periods before they were discarded ._. 
For instance ,_,  in almost all American presidential elections before the Civil War ,_,  a Northerner was always paired with a Southerner; but this regional balancing ,_,  on account of its sacrifice of merit and competence ,_,  was discarded right after the civil war ._. 
And because of its inherently undemocratic and even antidemocratic antecedents ,_,  ticket balancing with regard to ideology was discontinued in 1970 ._. 
Now ,_,  if any of these issues becomes important ,_,  it is only incidental to the candidates' capacity to draw the crowds ._. 
And now even after they have come to the bridge ,_,  Nigerians fear to cross it ._. 
Roland Ogbonnaya and Stanley Nkwazema spoke with Senator Muhammed Ali Ndume on some topical national issues ._. 
Excerpts :_: You came into the House of Representatives on the platform of the All Nigeria Peoples Party ANPP for two terms ._. 
You later defected to the Peoples Democratic Party PDP ,_,  where you won a seat into the senate ._. 
Now ,_,  you have moved to the All Progressives Congress APC ._. 
Why did you take that decisionWell ,_,  let me first of all say that every politics is local ._. 
This is because politics at your local level determines the party you belong to ._. 
Two ,_,  there is no fundamental difference in terms of ideology ,_,  in terms of manifestos ,_,  or in terms of even slogan between our various political parties ._. So ,_,  that makes it easier for you to move from one party to the other without fighting your conscience ._. 
It is a matter of finding a platform that is convenient for you to be able to represent your people ._. 
In our North -_: east axis ,_,  in 1999 it was predominantly the opposition ,_,  APP and then later ANPP ._. If you remember ,_,  ANPP won Bauchi and Gombe at one time; ANPP won Yobe ,_,  Borno except Adamawa and Taraba in the North -_: east ._. 
So ,_,  you see that was initially ._. 
And then because of political intrigues here and there ,_,  these states moved from ANPP to PDP ,_,  some to other parties ._. 
Let me tell you ,_,  I personally belong to the progressive set -_: up of politicians ,_,  and you know generally ,_,  you can say that PDP is not the progressive type of party rather it's more of combination of conservative so to say ._. 
And I really don't fit in there and that is one of the main problems I have with PDP ._. 
Besides ,_,  about the local factor ,_,  my people prefer that I should be where I was and that is ANPP ._. 
The PDP has not been fair to my people; it has not been fair to me; it has not been fair to my state and it has not been fair to the zone that I represent ._. 
If you see in terms of the challenges that we have presently and the response of government towards the suffering of our people ,_,  then you will see that you don't have any reason to continue supporting the government that doesn't recognise you ,_,  which marginalises you or even deserts you ._. 
You know in the North -_: east ,_,  we have a lot of challenges in terms of insecurity ._. 
The poor people cannot go to their farms; they cannot do their local businesses and nothing is being done ._. 
I find it very hard to belong to a government or the ruling party that I'm representing and I cannot do anything ._. Have you at some point express your views about some of these situations to the government or explain to it what it was meant to doAny government does not need somebody to tell them this because government is not a deaf and dumb person ._. 
Besides that as you said ,_,  we had made efforts and I want to commend the government on one part because you just don't say you want to do blanket condemnation ._. 
The president did one thing that was very commendable and that was when we cried out louder that hunger was setting in ._. 
He released 300 trucks from the strategic grain reserved to address the challenges of food in that area ._. 
But if you look at that ,_,  it is a tip of the iceberg; it cannot do anything ._. 
You can't keep on feeding people from the strategic grains reserved ,_,  you have to go in and see how they can be able to do little things they can survive on ._. 
That is the other aspect ._. 
In fact ,_,  I had to take it upon myself to ensure that even those 300 trucks get to where they are ._. 
As I'm speaking to you now ,_,  we are still battling because of the level of corruption in all these ._. 
Some people are trying to short -_: change us ,_,  so I had to personally supervise the progress ._. 
We thank God in southern Borno and as I said ,_,  we have to commend the government for that because that has gone a long way to help our people ,_,  especially when they were in dire need during the rainy season ._. Some believe that the problem of Boko Haram should be blamed on the governorsThat is truly part of the problem ._. 
You know it's not only in Borno and Yobe that leadership has been part of the problems in this country and that's why I'm saying unless there is leadership revolution to provide good governance ,_,  accountable government ,_,  then God forbid ,_,  this country may witness mass revolution ._. 
If you look at the Nigerian government generally and the democracy that we ushered in ,_,  if there's good leadership Nigeria would have gone from bad to better but we have gone from bad to worst ._. 
And the main reason for that is bad leadership ._. 
And then ,_,  you can't get bad leadership unless there's bad followership; so you can't blame only us ._. Back to the issue of defection ,_,  the same people in PDP are the ones defecting to APC ,_,  what then makes them progressive in any senseNo ,_,  they are like -_: minds ._. 
It's now like sieving and separating ._. 
In PDP ,_,  you have all sorts of people but there are some progressives as well as conservatives ._. 
So ,_,  what is happening now is that the progressive elements are moving over to APC and the conservative elements and retrogressive ones to some extent ,_,  are from APC to PDP ._. 
So ,_,  we are moving now virtually towards a two -_: party system ,_,  where whether consciously or unconsciously ,_,  the issue of ideology will come out and it's about coming out ._. 
If you look at PDP now ,_,  it has been personalised and to some extent privatised ._. 
But if you look at APC now ,_,  it's a conglomeration of various interests that were having those characteristics but have now sacrificed all those and come together to form a partnership ._. There are those who believe that with the crisis in APC ,_,  the party is dead on arrival ._. 
For example in your state ,_,  you are not in good terms with Ali Modu Sheriff ,_,  so how are you going to work together I have nothing personal against Ali Modu Sheriff; it was interest that separated us then and politics is about interest ._. 
Actually what made me leave ANPP to be honest with you was because I felt that there was no level playing ground and fairness ._. 
Now ,_,  where you have people of various interests coming together and are discussing those interests is different from where you must key into individual or private interests ._. 
In APC ,_,  Ali Modu Sheriff has his interest and I have my own interest too ._. 
But he doesn't own the party now ._. 
I don't own the party either; it's a different thing ._. Do you see APC as a potential threat to PDPThat is a question that you are supposed to answer better than myself because I'm in APC ._. 
It is you that is out there that is supposed to pass your judgment ._. 
But you know that Nigeria actually needs a change that any party can provide ._. 
PDP has ruled this country since 1999 as the major party ,_,  with major states ,_,  with majority in the National Assembly ._. 
As a Nigerian ,_,  if you speak the truth ,_,  where have we moved from 1999 till date ,_,  looking at the resources at our disposal The type of people Nigeria have in terms of human resources ,_,  if you look at where we were in 1999 under the military that handed over to civilian ,_,  which is PDP to date in 2014 ,_,  you can without fear of contradiction say that we have moved from bad to worst ._. 
Nigerians have given their votes to the government of the PDP now getting to 16 years and we have moved from bad to worse ._. 
We need to change; we need to try something else ._. You said you were on sabbatical in PDP and that you have moved to where you belong ._. 
But many Nigerians see some of these defections as based purely on selfish interestTo some extent you can say that may happen in some cases ,_,  but it's not fair to generalise my own case for example ._. 
Looking at what PDP has done to me or even looking at my nature ,_,  I'm sure you must have been monitoring my political activities since I was in the House ,_,  you will ask me what am I doing in PDP My conscience will not even allow me settle in PDP ._. 
I've not been comfortable in PDP because I don't really belong there ._. 
And as I say ,_,  I was on sabbatical and my sabbatical leave is over ._. In view of your travails ,_,  would you say you're a largely misunderstood personTo outsiders ,_,  to people that don't know me ,_,  but the people that I represent ,_,  you will be surprised the belief they have in me ._. 
So ,_,  when they talked about the travails I went through ,_,  the support that I got from my people especially those that are not even Muslims -_:  the Christians -_:  is unbelievable ._. 
This issue of Boko Haram and religion -_: you see now I'm sponsoring ten pilgrims to Jerusalem this April because I came from that background ,_,  my mother is a Christian and my brothers ._. I was a Christian too from my childhood ._. 
I grew up as a Christian till my father took me over when I was in secondary school and he converted me to Islam and I became a Muslim ._. 
So ,_,  my people know that I'm the first candidate that was endorsed and still being endorsed by the Christian Association of Nigeria in my zone ._. 
Even as I decamp now ,_,  I want to tell you that the Christian Association of my zone are fully behind me 100 per cent and I had to even contact them to let them know about my change in party and they said wherever you find yourself ,_,  we are 100 per cent behind you ._. 
Minna � The Northern States Governors Forum NSGF has expressed shock and sadness at the killing of seven policemen and a civilian in a raid on Gwaram town in Jigawa State on Wednesday ,_,  urging the insurgents to immediately stop the attacks ._. Chairman of the forum and Governor of Niger State ,_,  Dr ._.  Mu'azu Babangida Aliyu expressed the forum's deepest condolences to the families of the victims as well as the police high command ,_,  saying no grievance can justify such a dastardly act against law enforcement agents ._. In a statement signed by Governor Aliyu's spokesman ,_,  Danladi Ndayebo ,_,  the forum also condemned the killing of several farmers and destruction of property by suspected herdsmen in Wukari ,_,  Taraba State ,_,  describing it as one attack too many ._. The statement called on security agencies to ensure that the perpetrators are caught and brought to justice ,_,  to prevent a reoccurrence ,_,  emphasizing that a situation where security personnel on whose shoulders lie the responsibility of protecting lives and property become easy targets for criminals was unacceptable ._. The statement lamented frequent attacks on the police and other security agents ,_,  saying the nation cannot afford a situation where criminal elements will overwhelm state security apparatus ._. The forum said Northern Governors were working closely with the federal government in the nation's fight against terrorism and further assured citizens of their safety wherever they live ._. The Governors prayed God to grant the souls of the deceased eternal rest and members of their families the fortitude to bear the loss ._. 
An indication of the utility of international cooperation to curb cross -_: border crime was demonstrated recently when large caches apparently destined for Nigeria were seized by Cameroonian gendarmes along that country's border with Nigeria ._. It represent a small victory in the effort to stem the flow of small arms to Nigeria ,_,  which could add to the country's security challenges ,_,  particularly in the North East region ._. 
Cameroonian authorities should be praised for the recent seizure of weapons ,_,  which Nigerian officials believe was meant to resupply insurgents in the North East ._. 
According to a spokesman for the Nigerian Army ,_,  the caches included 288 rifles and 35 rockets; rocket propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices IEDs ._. 
Two suspects carrying over 50 Cameroonian passports were arrested ._. 
The seizure no doubt is a boost to the collaborative efforts by the two countries towards curbing the activities of insurgency and other crimes that the trade in small arms fuels ._. Cameroon had previously been accused of not doing enough to assist Nigeria to curb the insurgents suspected to be operating out of Cameroon ._. 
Nigerian authorities have often complained that insurgents linked to Boko Haram routinely flee into Cameroon after perpetrating mayhem in Nigeria ._. 
While the Cameroonian authorities pledged to back Nigeria's counterterrorism operations ,_,  little had been done to show such commitment ._. 
There are many in Nigeria who urged the government to invoke Nigeria's national interest and chase the insurgents in hot pursuit into another country ,_,  regardless of border protocols ._. In fact ,_,  that event has occurred before ,_,  when in 1983 the military government of General Muhammadu Buhari ordered troops into Chad to repel a brief Chadian invasion of Nigerian territory through Borno State ._. 
Even in Western democracies ,_,  particularly the United States ,_,  soldiers have been deployed to enter other countries without prior arrangement in enforcement of the national interest ._. 
However ,_,  such militarist response on the part of Nigeria in the current circumstances could be misconstrued; and could potentially open up wider and unintended ramifications and consequences ._. 
That is why reaching an understanding with Nigeria's neighbours was the proper way to go ._. The successful assistance of Cameroonian authorities in seizing arms caches attests to the wisdom of that that diplomatic initiative ._. 
Apart from the arms recovered ,_,  disclosures from captured terrorism suspects have apparently led to more arms being seized in the ongoing offensive in different areas ._. 
A military spokesman noted that since the Cameroonian authorities pledged to back Nigerian security forces in the fight to curb insurgent activities ,_,  the results have been positive ._. 
It is vitally important that the impetus be kept up by better use of internal security mechanisms ._. The age -_: long tradition of communal vigilance should be encouraged and revived ._. 
District and village heads and other community leaders should be able to identify and point out strangers in their areas ._. 
The Border Communities Development Agency also has a role to play in improving security in these areas ._. 
Over the years ,_,  border security and management has been left chiefly to the customs and immigration services to deal with ,_,  and these alone are incapable of controlling wide expanses of land that demarcate Nigeria's borders with other countries ._. The widespread smuggling of goods into the country is indicative of the porous nature of these borders and the challenging in controlling movement through them ._. 
Until the menace of the insurgency ,_,  not much attention had been paid to tightening border security ._. 
Local intelligence is required to effectively combat the menace of cross -_: border terrorism ._. 
Not only should such communities be willing and prepared to assist the authorities in their intelligence gathering ,_,  it is in their long -_: term communal interests to report on those whose presence in their midst presents a security threat ._. 
Such border community vigilance would strengthen international cooperation in addressing the threat of terrorism and other crimes ._. 
Damaturu � Suspected Boko Haram members yesterday attacked fans at a football viewing center at Central Market area ,_,  Gabashin Kasuwa in Potiskum town of Yobe state ._. Yobe State Commissioner of Police Sanusi A Rufa'i confirmed the attack saying that one person died instantly while many others were injured ._. He said that the injured were taken to a hospital in Potiskum ._. Daily Trust gathered that the attackers stormed the area at around 8 :_: 45pm in Volkswagen Golf car and parked at the entrance of the viewing center before unleashing the terror ._. An eye witness ,_,  Malam Abubakar ,_,  said that five of the attackers went into the center and opened fire while the remaining members of the gang continued shooting sporadically outside ._. He said that the person who died instantly was a commercial phone charger outside the viewing center ,_,  adding that the number of casualties could not be ascertained because many people escaped with bullet wounds ._. A source at the Potiskum General Hospital confirmed receiving one corpse and eight wounded people ._. 
A member of the House of Representatives ,_,  Hon ._. 
Albert Sam -_: Tsokwa ,_,  has declared that only the Speaker of the House ,_,  Hon ._. 
Aminu Tambuwal ,_,  and not the courts ,_,  can vacate the seats of the 37 lawmakers that defected from the Peoples Democratic Party PDP to the All Progressives Congress APC ._. The lawmaker further stated that there was the need for northern governors to address the issue of terrorism and herdsmen/farmers clashes ._. The Taraba born lawmaker ,_,  who is the chairman of the House Committee on Rules and Business ,_,  warned that the herdsmen/farmers clashes were a time bomb which if left unchecked ,_,  had the tendency to transform into the Boko Haram challenge the country is grappling with ._. Tsokwa PDP ,_,  who represents Donga/SSA/Takum/Special Area federal constituency of Taraba State stated this yesterday during a press briefing at the National Assembly ._. Reacting to the PDP Governors Forum's demands for the sack of the defecting lawmakers ,_,  Tsokwa said aggrieved persons should approach the courts for a writ of mandamus if they felt the law was not being adhered to in the case of the 37 defecting lawmakers ._. Tsokwa said ,_,  Let me begin by saying the court is not Father Christmas ,_,  a court has no jurisdiction ,_,  a court has no right ,_,  a court has no power to give what is not asked for ._. Now as to next course of action ,_,  the constitution is very clear ,_,  that power to declare seat of any member vacant is vested in the senate president or the speaker of the House of Representatives ,_,  and no other person in Nigeria have that power not even the court ._. 
If I am aggrieved that the senate president has not done what he should have done or the speaker has not done what he should have done the only way we can involve a court is go to the court and ask for an order of mandamus to compel him to do what the law requires him to do ._. He further said ,_,  What we call farmer/grazer conflict is akin to insurgency against the farmer ._. 
A grazer is a farmer ._. 
The young cultivator is a farmer ._. 
Just as I cannot walk up to your land and begin to make heaps because your land is good and I want to plant rice there ,_,  a grazer too has no right to walk into my land no matter how conducive for grazing and begin to graze there ._. 
If he has no land ,_,  I have land ._.

Gunmen suspected to be members of the Boko Haram stormed a football viewing centre on Wednesday night ,_,  killing one person ._. The police in Yobe confirmed that the gunmen stormed the viewing centre in Potiskum Town of Yobe during the UEFA Champions League clash between Manchester United and Bayern Munich ._. Six other viewers were also injured in the attack ._. Sanusi Rufai ,_,  the Yobe Commissioner of Police ,_,  confirmed the incident on Thursday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria ._. He said that the gunmen stormed the centre while the fans were watching a match between Manchester United and Bayern Munich ,_,  and started shooting ._. The commissioner said the corpse of the deceased had been deposited at the General Hospital ,_,  Potiskum ,_,  while those injured were receiving treatment at the hospital ._. Mr ._. 
Rufai said security men had been mobilised to search for the attackers ._. Yobe is one of the three states under emergency rule due to the terrorist activities of the Boko Haram group ._. The insurgents ,_,  in one of the recently released videos by its leader ,_,  Abubakar Shekau ,_,  threatened to attack such viewing centres and schools ._. Over 1 ,_, 500 people have been killed in Boko Haram related attacks in 2014 alone ,_,  according to Amnesty International ._. NAN
Northern governors support terrorism in their domains ,_,  House of Representatives member Albert Sam -_: Tsokwa said yesterday ._. He said their inability to tackle clashes between herdsmen and farmers in many parts of the region suggested their support terrorism ._. The lawmaker who is the chairman of the House committee on Rules and Business stated this while addressing newsmen at the National Assembly ,_,  Abuja yesterday ._. Most of the problems we have are created by our leaders and that was why in one occasion ,_,  I said I am of the opinion that most northern governors support terrorism ._. 
Because I see the attacks on farmers as a terrorist act ,_,  not a conflict ,_,  he said ._. Sam -_: Tsokwa who represents Donga/SSA/Takum federal constituency of Taraba state also said elections in areas where safety of life could not be guaranteed would be difficult to conduct ._. He said the attacks on farmers amounted to an act of terrorism ,_,  similar to Boko Haram insurgency leaving the country hanging a ticking time bomb if left unchecked ._. He said :_:  You stay in your house ,_,  somebody come to your land and begin to cause problems and destroy your crops ._. 
You complain and he brings out a gun ,_,  sacks you from that place and they call it conflict ._. 
What conflict is that It is an act of terrorism ._. Reacting to INEC's concern in going ahead with election in states facing insurgency by members of Boko Haram ,_,  Sam -_: Tsokwa said :_:  this is a question of fact ._. 
You cannot talk of food in a house when there is no peace ._. If INEC said it would conduct elections in those states ,_,  I am telling you if I were to be in any of the states ,_,  I will not vote ._. 
What is the point if in the process ,_,  I am going to die
Islam preaches tolerance ,_,  and perseverance but not to the level of molestation and daring Allah ,_,  the only point Muslim Ummah can resist any oppression is when there is persecution for freedom of religion ._. Many experiences have shown that Muslims are marginalised in every sphere of our national affairs ._. 
We are aware of this ,_,  but we exercise patience to allow peace to reign ._. In the southwest of this country ,_,  for instance ,_,  you see many members of single family practicing different faiths without any rancour ,_,  it is because we are trained in that way ._. 
See the Holy Qur'an ,_,  where many instructions have been given to Muslims not to persecute the people of other faiths ._. 
Islam does not justify act of killing innocent people in the name of Jihad ._. The essence of the Shariah is to respect ,_,  protect and preserve human dignity in five ways as follows :_: 1 preservation of religion2 preservation of soul/spirit/life3 preservation of family4 preservation of reasoning/IQ5 preservation of individual propertyThese five roles of Shariah are the practical realities of Islam ,_,  so whoever deviates from observing them is not preaching Sharia; whatever he does is his/her own ._. Therefore ,_,  the co -_: existence of Muslims and believers of other faiths should be allowed to prevail with sincerity ,_,  having known that our creator has His own best reason for creating us with different faiths as He said in the Holy Qur'an ._. 
However man can invite others to his faith if both parties enjoy that privilege ._. In relation to what happened in national confab during the inauguration of the conference when a pastor who hails from Muslim background denied his sitting Chairman from saying Bismillahi Rahman Raheem ,_,  claiming that he did not know the meaning of that statement ,_,  I am taken aback because the attack is uncalled for at an avenue where we have converged to understand and find solution to our differences; harmonise our views on how to run the nation ._. The pastor has no moral justification in that circle to attack the chairman ._. 
Pastor Tunde Bakare should apologise to Nigerians for upsetting decorum of the system organised to address the yearning and demand of Nigerians for tolerance ,_,  peace and unity ._. 
He should know that he has disappointed people like us who cherish to listen to his preaching on Sundays on Channel Television ._. 
Having been convinced that he really hates Islam ._. In our faith we believe that anything without invocation of Allah's guidance is a wasted effort ,_,  because He is the Supreme Being that will determine the success of that endeavours ._. Is it not that type of misunderstanding that we are gathered to address at the confab Yet it is at that same gathering that some are still creating rancour ,_,  intolerance and bigotry ._. 
My surprise is for those who consented to the idea of abolishing opening prayer just because they do not want adherents of a particular religion to exercise their religious right ._. Thank God ,_,  the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs has risen up to the challenge because the marginalisation of Muslims by this administration is very obvious ._. 
Muslims are a peaceful community ._. People make mistake when they refer to Nigeria as a secular state ._. 
What are the features of a secular state ,_,  do we have those features Going by the Oxford Dictionary definition ,_,  a secular state is a state that does not believe in God in the people's way of life ._. Can anybody among Christians and Muslims boldly come out and tell the world that we do not believe in God Why are deceiving ourselves by calling Nigeria a secular stateFinally I urge that those who hate Islam should stop daring Allah in His majesty ._. 
Let everybody practice whatever he or she believes and trusts ,_,  you can never fight for God ._. One recalls the recent development in the polity where the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs had to visit the Villa to express their grievances about marginalisation meted out to Muslims at the ongoing confab ,_,  but CAN came out to reply Sultan by advising Jonathan not to consider their position ._. 
This is really unfortunate as whenever it is the Muslims that respond they are tagged BOKO HARAM ._. 
Who is fooling who Allah is watching !_. Stop planning against Allah through Islam ,_,  I swear whoever fights Islam is fighting Allah God Almighty ,_,  the sole creator of heaven and earth ._. 
The United States of America has described the 2015 general election as an important test for Nigeria ,_,  urging politicians ,_,  the media and individuals to make a pledge that they will not advocate ,_,  support or condone violence before during or after the elections ._. The US Ambassador to Nigeria ,_,  James Entwistle ,_,  said this during his interactive tour of the Middle Belt  ._. The envoy who paid a courtesy call on the Governor of Plateau State ,_,  Jonah Jang and the University of Jos where he interacted with staff and students of the institution ,_,  however noted that Nigeria had great potential ._. He said :_:  Your diversity should be a source of strength ,_,  not strive ._. 
People must learn to tolerate and get along with each other ._. 
Across the globe ,_,  history has shown that countries that make progress are those whose communities leave in peace with each other ._. While pledging his country's support to strengthen the democratic process in Nigeria ,_,  Entwhistle also emphasised the importance of US -_: Nigeria bilateral relationship in terms of trade and economics ,_,  democracy issues ,_,  partnering on shared security ,_,  and advancing access for all Nigerians to education and health resources ._. The ambassador also urged the Nigerian government and the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC to address the issues of internally displaced persons so that they are not disenfranchised in next year's elections ._. Jang ,_,  who in his response expressed optimism that Nigeria would breakthrough its challenges ,_,  called on the US to exercise patience with the country ,_,  adding that the current security challenges the country is faced with would have been surmounted if Nigerians were sincere ._. Jang added that the herdsmen's attack on farmers in the Middle Belt states ,_,  where well -_: trained hired mercenaries with automatic weapons wreaked havoc on innocent farmers was really unfortunate ._. 
At the University of Jos ,_,  the Vice -_: Chancellor ,_,  Professor Hayward Mafuyai ,_,  appreciated the visit and called for more collaboration between the American Embassy and the institution ._. He noted that Nigeria is an emerging democracy that is contending with multitude of security related challenges such as Boko Haram insurgency in the North -_: east geo -_: political zone ,_,  kidnappings ,_,  rising cases of rape and other violent crimes ._. He said Nigeria would continue to count on the support of the United States' government to tackle these security challenges ._. 
One of the novelties of the 2011 presidential election was the choice of Pastor Tunde Bakare as running mate to General Mohammadu Buhari on the presidential ticket of the Congress for Progressive Change CPC ._. 
It attracted a lot of curiosity and invited ceaseless speculation ._. 
Bakare attained a measure of national recognition during the agitation against the attempt by the loyalists of the late President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua to hold Nigeria hostage following the health crisis of the former president in 2010 ._. He convened a group called the Save Nigeria Group to exert pressure for the application of the constitutional prescription for succession in the event of the infirmity of the president ._. 
Before then ,_,  he was little known outside the Pentecostal Christian circles where he had cultivated the image of a radical cleric ._. 
A substantial proportion of that radicalism was pulpit political activism in the genre of the liberation theology tradition of South America ._. Now as before ,_,  Gen ._. 
Buhari labours under the burden of a general perception of him as Islamic religious hardliner ._. 
Much of his populist appeal is grounded in his self -_: exposition and definition as ethno -_: religious irredentist leader ._. 
The image has served a contradictory purpose and has been of mixed blessings ._. 
It has engendered for him the worship and devotion of the fervid masses across the Muslim North ._. 
It has equally precluded him from being accepted as a national leader ._. 
It is safe to assume that it is in the appreciation of the need to compensate for this politically balanced identity deficit that he chose not just the complement of a Christianity professing running mate but a Pentecostal pastor to boot ._. 
There is also this noticeable affinity in name and temperament between Bakare and erstwhile deputy to Buhari  -_:  the late General Tunde Idiagbon ._. Is this evocation a coincidence or borne of a bout of nostalgia Although the inherent positive gesture and sensitivity did not yield the hoped for dividends of helping to clinch substantial votes across the religious divide ,_,  it has gone down in memory as an acknowledgement of the obligation to respond to a widely held negative public perception ._. 
How then should we classify the reversal of this positive impulse into a mold that reinforces the negative perception of the same actor -_:  The mold of his first coming as military ruler for instance ._. 
In leadership composition ,_,  Buhari's military regime was conspicuously and uniquely lopsided ._. 
The three most senior functionaries comprising himself ,_,  Idiagbon as Chief of Staff Supreme Headquarters and General Ibrahim Babangida as Chief of Army Staff were all Muslims from the Northern half of the country ._. 
Before and after his dictatorship in both civilian and military government dispensations ,_,  this peculiarity has been the sole exception to the norm of geopolitical balancing ._. I'm neither a member nor promoter of the All Progressives Congress APC ,_,  and so I'm not expected to ,_,  and will not play the role of strategising for the national electorate acceptance of the APC ._. 
But I hold a non -_: partisan vested interest in the welfare and well -_: being of Nigeria ._. 
And this is what is at stake when a major political organisation purports to take the position that Nigerian politics is religion blind or that it is impervious to religious sensibilities ._. 
And there is nothing idealistic about this position either ._. 
It ceases to be idealistic when you exercise the power of choice in a manner that ignores the sentiments and sensibilities of large numbers of your country's population ._. I'm not required to be in the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria CAN to expect  -_:  given Nigeria's religious composition and political susceptibilities ,_,  the President of CAN to speak out against a potential Muslim -_: Muslim presidential ticket neither would I find fault with the President of the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs SCIA if he chooses to make an issue of a Christian -_: Christian ticket ._. It is their duty and obligation to ensure that adherents of their faith are not exposed to the psychology of political marginalisation and vulnerability ._. 
The matters of faith are not readily amenable to logic and rationalisation ._. 
It is one aspect of our life where perception is far more consequential than reality ._. 
We worship a God we do not see whose dispensation is often discretionary and arbitrary ._. 
Religion begins where logic stops ._. 
And so it is foolhardy to suggest that in a nation as steeped in religiosity -_: albeit mostly ostentatious ,_,  as Nigeria is ,_,  sceptical Christians can somehow be disinterested in the spectre of a president and vice -_: president attending Jumat service and other newsworthy religious observances as a pair of same religious faith bearers and vice versa ._. Rightly and inevitably ,_,  my attention will be drawn to the presidential ticket of Chief Moshood Abiola and Babagana Kingibe in 1993 ._. 
That precedent is unique to the extent that religion came in contact with a more powerful though ephemeral sentiment of power shift to the Southern half of Nigeria ._. 
It is the cause of the fulfilment of this passionate 'Southern' nationalist aspiration that the facility of inter faith concession was called to serve ._. 
The concession was compelled by the supervening desire of a Southerner acceding to the Presidency ._. Of greater significance is the observation that the 1993 event belonged to a qualitatively different era from the one that commenced in Nigeria in 1999 and the world at large in September 11 ,_,  2001 ._. 
The latter era of high profile religious politics was initiated in the Sharia uprising that erupted in the heydays of the Fourth Republic ._. 
The reading of the subtext of the Sharia crisis was its interpretation as a contrived instrument of subversion against the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo who happens to be a Christian professing president from the South ._. 
This reading may be right or wrong but if any politician should make atonement for the role he or she played in this sad episode the two leading contenders for the prize are the former governor of Zamfara State ,_,  Senator Ahmed Yerima Sani ,_,  and Gen ._. 
Buhari ._. There is nothing in the conduct and profile of Sani ,_,  before ,_,  during and after his tenure as governor that can be adduced as evidence to suggest that he mooted the introduction of fundamentalist Sharia jurisprudence out of piety and concern for the religious health of the people of Zamfara State ._. 
I will let Buhari speak for himself :_:  I will continue to show openly and inside me the total commitment to the Sharia movement that is sweeping all over Nigeria ._. 
God willing ,_,  we will not stop the agitation for the total implementation of the Sharia in the country ._. 
Muslims should vote at the next presidential election only for someone who would defend their faithSince 1999 ,_,  the misuse and abuse of religion -_: resulting in interminable crisis and widespread explosion of violence has escalated and lately peaked in the rogue manifestation of the Boko Haram insurgency ._. 
Concurrent with the Nigerian calendar of escalating religious crisis is the world -_: historic resurgence of Al Qaeda which dramatically altered the consciousness of religion inspired terrorism all over the world with the assault on the United States of America on September 11 ,_,  2001 ._. 
The Al Qaeda network rapidly blossomed to become a global franchise and it was predictably not long before its affiliate in the Maghreb found common purposes with its Nigerian imitator ,_,  Boko Haram ._. 
Subsequently Nigeria was emphatically introduced to the world as a newly acquired homestead of international terror with the bombing of the United Nations building a few years ago ._. With Boko Haram as pace setters ,_,  we now contend with its proliferating mutations ._. 
Nobody now knows whether the bloody intra -_: regional fragmentation along religious and tribal lines in the towns and villages of the Middle Belt occur independently of the Boko Haram command or not ._. 
Today we are told of the murderous visitations of Fulani marauders to the villages and settlements of fellow Fulani in Katsina and Zamfara States ._. 
Another day it is reported that rampaging Fulani are engaged in a war of attrition against the Eggons and the Ombatse cult in Nassarawa State ._. Immediately after the inauguration of the National Conference by President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  religion forced its way to the top of the conference agenda -_: aided and abetted by the choice of the opening and closing religious salutation by the conference chairman ,_,  Justice Idris Kutigi ._. 
Within a day or two of the inauguration ,_,  the scribe of the SCIA ,_,  I cannot now remember his name ,_,  gave out the new census distribution of Nigeria in the ratio of 62 per cent Muslims to the 38 per cent of Christians and others ._. This earth -_: shaking revelation was intended to highlight the grave injustice inflicted on the Nigeria Muslim umaa by the negatively disproportionate representation of the Muslims in the composition of the conference delegates ._. 
The convener of the conference ,_,  President Jonathan ,_,  dutifully cut short his visit to Europe and rushed back home to receive a powerful delegation led by the Sultan of Sokoto ,_,  Saad Abubakar III ,_,  which came to seek the immediate redress of this offence against Nigerian Muslims ._. The CAN of course did not take all this lying low ._. 
The battle was soon joined by the secretary -_: general who warned his SCIA counterpart to withdraw the provocative Christian marginalising census figures failing which he would announce his own figures and initiate legal proceedings to contest the Islamic version ._. 
It was in the thick of this religious muscle flexing and mutual aggravation that the breaking news of APC getting set to unleash a Muslim -_: Muslim presidential ticket was served hot and sizzling on the front page banner of a prominent newspaper ._. I have never believed that the presidential aspiration of the APC will seriously go beyond propaganda and hot air ._. 
And I couldn't care less but I'm worried at the nuisance value of such a ticket ._. 
It promotes exclusion precisely in the aspect of our life where we most need inclusion ._. 
It is dismissive of the Nigerian federalist motto of unity amidst diversity ._. 
It is provocative and fraught with the danger of lending its platform ,_,  wittingly or not ,_,  to sectarian bigotry ,_,  chauvinism and conflagration ._. 
Let us hope that the spirit of the Buhari -_: Bakare ticket will prevail over that of the Buhari -_: Idiagbon junta that abrogated civil democratic rule three decades ago ._. 
Gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram members stormed a packed viewing centre in Yobe State and shot dead two people watching Champions League matches ,_,  police said Thursday ._. The centre was showing the two quarter -_: final matches between defending champions Bayern Munich and Manchester United and Atletico Madrid and Barcelona ,_,  on Wednesday when it was attacked ._. 
The gunmen came in a car and opened fire outside the viewing centre and sped off ,_,  Yobe State police commissioner Sanusi Rufa'i told AFP of the incident in Potiskum ,_,  a hotbed of the insurgency ._. One person died on the spot while another died later at the hospital ._. 
Several other people were injured ,_,  some critically ,_,  he added ._. Residents said the centre was full at the time ,_,  with those who could not get a space inside hanging around the windows to watch the second -_: leg games ,_,  which saw Bayern and Atletico reaching the last four ._. Rufa'i did not directly blame Boko Haram for the attack but the hardline group has been known for preaching against football as part of its agenda to impose strict Islamic law in northern Nigeria ._. In several video clips ,_,  Boko Haram leader ,_,  Abubakar Shekau ,_,  had described football and music as a Western ploy to distract Muslims from their religion ._. In April 2012 ,_,  gunmen killed two men at a viewing centre in Potiskum ,_,  days after Boko Haram warned people in leaflets to stay away from such centres and calling for such places to be closed ._. Football is Nigeria's national sport and the country's national team ,_,  the Super Eagles ,_,  are the reigning African champions ._. English Premier League football is wildly popular ,_,  with many Nigerians supporting top clubs such as Arsenal ,_,  Chelsea ,_,  Manchester United and Liverpool ,_,  whose matches are shown live on television ._. 
The Minority Leader ,_,  House of Representatives ,_,  Femi Gbajabiamila ,_,  Thursday explained that although the ruling Peoples Democratic Party PDP manifesto may be similar to that of his party ,_,  the All Progressives Congress APC ,_,  the point of difference is the way to achieve their goals ._. Gbajabiamila stated this in Abuja while addressing the European Political Counsellors' Working Group about his party's manifesto and its argument for change ._. Gbajabiamila who spoke at the session attended by political counsellors from Germany ,_,  France ,_,  Italy ,_,  Sweden ,_,  Ireland ,_,  Hungary ,_,  Netherlands and Belgium ,_,  said the concern that Nigerians see the difference between APC and PDP manifestos like six and a half dozen dominated discourse at the international session ._. A statement by his aide on research ,_,  Wasiu Olanrewaju -_: Smart ,_,  quoted him as saying :_:  Similarities if any in the two manifestos is just on paper ._. 
We differ in our roadmap to achieving the manifestos ._. 
PDP may talk about free education but this same party once had a sitting president who set up a private university and did not show interest in quality public education ._. 
The same party produced a sitting president who was once a lecturer but now attached little importance to education ._. Gbajabiamila in his address ,_,  also said the approach of APC in its manifesto on power was different and believes that power generation should be removed from the exclusive list of the federal government ._. 
uUnder the APC government ,_,  states would be allowed to generate and distribute power according to the growing economic needs of their states ,_,  he said ._. He further challenged the international community to request that the Nigerian government and its leadership should defend its earlier assertion that Boko Haram sponsors were within its government and had infiltrated its rank ._. I don't know how far it is true that government now has its own Boko Haram for its own political advantage ._. Unfortunately ,_,  this is the same government that said Boko Haram members were part of its government and with all the resources at government's disposal ,_,  they could not be tamed ,_,  everyone here must question this government ._. The APC leader also insisted that political debates must be institutionalised in the political system ._. 
We must insist on political debates ._. 
Sometime ago ,_,  no one knew Babatunde Fashola ,_,  he was just a Chief of Staff but his articulation during the gubernatorial debate endeared him to Lagosians ._. 
APC in its manifesto believes that you do not need to be popular by name only to be in government ._. 
Your knowledge of issues of governance counts ,_,  he submitted ._. The Head of Political and Communication of European Union Delegation to Nigeria ,_,  Henry Prankerd ,_,  promised to support Nigeria in ensuring transparency in the coming 2015 general election ._. 
The International Organization for Migration says there has been a 10 -_: fold increase compared to a year ago in the number of migrants intercepted off the coast of Italy ._. 
Most of the migrants are trying to escape unrest in Africa and the Middle East ._. The International Organization for Migration says as of early April ,_,  almost 15 ,_, 000 migrants had arrived near the Italian coast this year ._. That compares to about 1 ,_, 500 for the same period last year ,_,  according to the group's Italy spokesman ,_,  Flavio Di Giacomo ._. These are people who are fleeing from wars and regimes ._. 
The main nationalities are Syrians ,_,  Eritreans ,_,  Somalis ,_,  people coming from Mali and sub -_: Saharan countries ,_,  said Di Giacomo ._. One of those would -_: be migrants is Jeckson Evax ,_,  who is from Nigeria ._. I left Nigeria because of the issue of Boko Haram ,_,  said Evax ._. Boko Haram is an Islamist militant group blamed for thousands of deaths since 2009 ._. Evax was among 46 African migrants who set out from Libya in a rubber raft ,_,  with hopes of reaching Europe ._. 
I want to go to Europe to continue my education ,_,  for freedom and for everything ,_,  he said ._. The migrants were intercepted by Libyan naval forces ._. Di Giacomo says last year an estimated 700 would -_: be migrants died as they attempted to cross the Mediterranean ._. It is time to prevent these tragedies from happening and the international community should develop a more comprehensive approach to protect migrants ,_,  he said ._. Di Giacomo says the international community has focused too much on border control and not enough on the humanitarian issues that prompt people to flee from their homelands ._. 
There are mounting fears over the fate of a man who went missing 11 days ago after tweeting pictures of an attempted jail break in Abuja ,_,  Amnesty International said today as joined a twitter action on his behalf ._. The man ,_,  identified by family members as Yusuf Siyaka Onimisi ,_,  has not been seen or heard from since 30 March after tweeting developments and images of fighting between Nigerian security forces and detainees trying to escape from the State Security Service SSS headquarters ._. 
He was reportedly working at an electrical sub -_: station within the nearby presidential compound when the fighting ,_,  which left 21 detainees dead ,_,  erupted ._. Nigerian security forces should immediately disclose the whereabouts and legal status of Yusuf Siyaka Onimisi ._. 
If he is in detention ,_,  Nigerian authorities must either charge him with a recognizably criminal offence or release him immediately ,_,  said Netsanet Belay ,_,  Research and Advocacy Director for Africa at Amnesty International ._. Yusuf Siyaka Onimisi's whereabouts are still unknown but witnesses reported that he was arrested by plainclothes armed men outside his office ,_,  raising fears the authorities have subjected him to an enforced disappearance ,_,  putting him at increased risk of torture or extrajudicial execution ._. 
The SSS has so far neither confirmed nor denied that they are detaining him ._. Amnesty International spoke to Sanusi Onimisi ,_,  the missing man's brother ,_,  who said Yusuf is the eldest of five siblings and had been working as a qualified electrical engineer ._. He has been arrested for 11 days without any information being given to the family ._. 
If the government treats people like this ,_,  who are the terrorists Who is the threat The family has been kept in darkness ._. 
If you are holding him or if there is to be a sentence of death ,_,  then tell the family ,_,  said Sanusi Onimisi ._. Amnesty International has joined a twitter action launched by local activists ,_,  using the hashtag #FreeCiaxon ,_,  calling on the SSS to release Yusuf Siyaka Onimisi ._. The SSS has launched an investigation into the attempted jailbreak in Abuja and alleges that the detainees were suspected Boko Haram members ._. 
However ,_,  the government has not yet given a full account of the incident ._. In a report released in late March ,_,  the organization documented the Nigerian security forces' alleged extrajudicial executions of more than 600 escaped detainees from Giwa Barracks ,_,  a military detention centre in Maiduguri ._. 
Nineteen people have been killed in separate attacks by suspected members of Boko Haram who laid siege on some locations in Dikwa ,_,  Kala -_: Balge and Konduga government areas of Borno State between Thursday and yesterday ._. 
The attacks have heightened fears of a new wave of violence by the insurgents in parts of the state where hundreds of people were killed this year ._. In Dikwa ,_,  one of the ancient towns in Borno State ,_,  it was gathered that the insurgents stormed a college in the early hours of Thursday ,_,  killed six teachers ,_,  two security men and took away some young women whose number is not immediately clear ._. A resident ,_,  Modu Kakarimi ,_,  who fled to Maiduguri yesterday said when they heard endless gunshots ,_,  so they had to flee to the bushes in search of safety ._. 
Our fear was heightened when we saw the boarding school in flames ._. 
We later gathered that they have killed eight there ._. 
We fled together with our women and children ,_,  he said ._. Senator Ahmed Zanna Borno Central who spoke to journalists on phone confirmed the incident in Dikwa but added that he was yet to get full details ._. 
There was siege on one of the schools in the town just after midnight on Friday ._. Mustapha Ali ,_,  a traveler who passed through Dalwa on his way to Maiduguri said the insurgents stormed the highway in broad daylight ._. 
Weekly Trust gathered that the insurgents also laid siege on Gwoza and Kalahgde in Southern part of Borno State on Thursday ._. 
They were said to have engaged the military in the two towns in an exchange of gunfire in an attempt to take control of the towns ._. Telephone services in Gwoza and environs were not going through but people from the area who made it to Maiduguri said most GSM masts had been vandalized by the attackers ._. 
There was no official comment on the incidents by security agencies in Maiduguri ._. 
Lagos � Nigeria's election next February will be the first nationwide two -_: party contest since the end of military rule in 1999 ._. 
The emergence last year of the All Progressives Congress APC ,_,  a merger of the country's four largest opposition movements ,_,  altered the political landscape ,_,  posing a serious challenge for the People's Democratic Party which has held the presidency for 15 years ._. Asiwaju Bola Tinubu ,_,  the new party's unofficial national leader and chief strategist ,_,  served two four -_: year terms as governor of Lagos ,_,  the megacity -_: state second in size only to Cairo in Africa ,_,  with a population exceeding 20 million ,_,  according to some estimates ._. 
Tinubu ,_,  who earned a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration from Chicago State University and worked as an accountant for Deloitte in the United States and Mobil in Nigeria ,_,  was also a leader of the democracy campaign that erupted after the Nigerian military annulled the 1993 election ._. 
There has been widespread speculation he could be chosen as the APC vice presidential candidate during the party's convention on 24 May ._. 
The leading contender for the top slot is believed to be Muhammadu Buhari ,_,  a retired general who served as military ruler in the 1980s and has run for president in the past three elections ,_,  coming in second each time ._. 
Tinubu spoke with AllAfrica's Reed Kramer about APC's prospects and platform ._. Why should vote Nigerians for APCWith APC ,_,  a new Nigeria is possible ._. 
This nation needs leaders who think and perform  -_:  not just ordinary thinkers ,_,  but doers ._. 
It's very rare ._. 
You can find policies all over the place ,_,  but have you been able to implement I have done that in Lagos ,_,  and they've seen it ._. 
A new city has manifested in their very eyes ._. 
It's working ._. 
We moved from controlling one state when I was a governor ,_,  to many across the country today  -_:  16 states ._. Is that enough support to defeat the PDP and win the electionIt's enough ,_,  because those are the critical states  -_:  unless we carry the wrong message ._. 
If we did lose the election ,_,  then it means they've rigged ._. 
How can they win the election if they don't have Kano ,_,  Lagos ,_,  Rivers ,_,  Oyo ,_,  Ogun states Do the arithmetic ._. 
It's the numbers ._. 
Nigeria has started on a new democratic journey ._. Why did you include in your recent birthday celebration a symposium that focused on 'the common man'My friends organized it ._. 
They know my passion  -_:  to give an opportunity for ordinary people to express themselves ,_,  to pour out their frustrations ,_,  difficulties and the problems that they might be having in their various endeavors ._. 
If you understand the difficulties out there in the grassroots ,_,  you will be able to plan to mitigate that difficult situation ._. 
If there are weaknesses in the system which are preventing them from realizing their objectives ,_,  then you can plan ._. 
It's very important to be informed ._. What are some examples of information that came out of the symposiumThe fertilizer problem is one  -_:  there's dishonesty in the distribution ._. 
The fact is that it's become too expensive and shouldn't be controlled by the Federal Government ._. 
Why should the Federal Government take that responsibility Why not push it to the states The states are closer to the people ._. 
Local Councils are much ,_,  much closer to farm producers ._. 
Why not leave it to themWhat is your overall assessment of the Federal Government's agricultural reforms ,_,  which includes restructuring delivery or fertilizer and seeds to farmersThere are good intentions ._. 
Since the 1960s ,_,  every leader in this country has talked about agriculture and food security ,_,  but none of them has implemented it faithfully ._. 
They come in with academic theories ,_,  but the way you handle agriculture in America or Britain is not the same way you can do it here ._. 
The infrastructure there and the commodity markets are not the same as that of Nigeria ._. 
You can copy method ,_,  processes and procedures ,_,  but you cannot copy totally because they mechanize farming ._. 
They have irrigation ._. 
We don't have much of that ._. 
You have to localize it ,_,  and whatever support in terms of finances that you have must go directly to the farmers ._. 
By creating bureaucracy ,_,  you're not going to get reform achieved ._. How would the APC approach agriculture differentlyAPC's plan is to create demand first ._. 
For example ,_,  in the schools we need to provide nutritional value for our children by offering ,_,  let's say ,_,  one egg for every pupil in the school per day ._. 
If you do that ,_,  poultry will spring up all over the country and that will create small -_: scale industry and jobs ._. 
The chicken feed required to create those eggs is an industry by itself ._. 
If you add half a loaf of bread ,_,  that will create tremendous bakery opportunities ._. 
You can include some pineapple juice ,_,  mango juice ,_,  some milk ._. 
Our pineapple plantations will grow ._. 
Mangos wasting away will be used ._. 
You will have an industrial base ._. 
And you will increase nutrition of our children and the enrollment in schools by 5000 percent ._. 
Children will voluntarily go to school ,_,  if only to eat ._. 
You take child labour and vagabonds out of the streets ._. 
This will galvanize the economy ,_,  and you must be ready to fund it ._. Can the government afford thisThe funding is there ._. 
What is the cost of an egg What is the cost of making an orange juice We have a pilot programme going in Osun State ,_,  and it is working ._. 
If you put internal controls in place to prevent irregularities and fraud ,_,  you will make enough savings out of the monies that are now being wasted and stolen to save the children of Nigeria ._. Is it possible for Nigeria to conduct a credible ,_,  free and fair election and to have that election peacefulOh yes ._. 
Every democrat must strive for a free and fair election in order to deserve the joy of victory ._. 
There is no programme that is perfect ,_,  but there are basic steps you can take ._. 
Biometrics ,_,  for example ,_,  is a modern technology that will validate and verify the detail of every registered voter ._. 
Why not employ that We're using it on I -_: Phone ._. 
Why not for voting We are going to hold the umpire to account ._. The umpire being the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC INEC ,_,  yes ._. 
We have to hope and expect INEC to operate with independence and respect for the rule of law ._. 
It is only when you do that that you have a nation ._. It seems if there's anything that Nigerians agree on ,_,  it is that all their politicians are corrupt ._. 
Are all politicians corruptNo !_. 
We shout of corruption all the time ,_,  but what have we done to control it and to really enhance the value and quality of life of our society Poverty is part of this multi -_: faceted problem ._. 
Every human being has a desire for a good quality of life ._. 
You cannot talk about corruption in the judiciary ,_,  for example ,_,  if you have not developed a system where you pay your judges well ._. 
If you give them a standard of living and don't steal their pension plan ,_,  there's no need for corruption ._. 
Have you paid your police officers an amount necessary for them to support their family If you have not done that and the guy on the roadside collects a bribe ,_,  then don't blame him ._. With transparency ,_,  accountability  -_:  honesty in the system  -_:  you can stop corruption ._. 
When I was a governor ,_,  I told my bureaucrats :_:  please understand that the public is your customer ._. 
Treat them like you want them to treat you if you go into their grocery store to purchase a package of items This is a two -_: way street ._. 
The service agency has a responsibility to the public ,_,  and the public has responsibility to insure that any government agency will perform ._. Were you able to make progress against corruption when you were governorI was ._. 
I eliminated that thing in my judiciary ,_,  it is clear ._. 
I eliminated it in the civil service ,_,  particularly the permanent secretaries and down the line ._. 
Agencies were functioning effectively for the people ._. 
We were able to create jobs without increasing taxes ._. 
Ordinary people were sweeping the streets ._. 
I could have gone for procurement of mechanical sweepers ,_,  and that would have created few job opportunities ._. 
But I said :_:  Let's use human beings ._. 
Let's bring dignity of labour back ._. Can this be done on a national levelIf it succeeds in Lagos ,_,  there is no place that it will not succeed in Nigeria !_. 
This is a microcosm of the country ._. What is the key to poverty alleviation in NigeriaConcentrate on the people ._. 
Make the people the cornerstone of the social and economic policy of the nation ._. 
It's not being done ._. 
We are earning enough here to improve the quality of life of our citizens ._. 
Economic growth must come first ,_,  and government must pay attention to medical care ,_,  to infrastructure and electricity ._. 
Why are they not concentrated on that There is a lack of clear vision to respond to the needs of the people ._. What can an APC government do differently to address the insecurity in the north of the countryWe will end it !_. 
No one should kill other human beings ,_,  innocent people ,_,  and say 'God is great' ._. 
These people declare war against our liberty ._. 
We've experienced this type of insurgency before  -_:  during the Miatatsine a 1980 uprising led by an Islamic preacher in Kano that claimed several thousand lives  ._. 
It was General Buhari who chased them out of the country ._. 
There is monumental corruption in the system involving money for those people who are supposed to fight the Boko Haram ._. 
The guy who is benefiting from the insurgency may not want it to end !_. 
They have allowed the problem to fester ._. We would take serious and decisive action ._. 
These people are not dropping from the sky ._. 
They are coming from somewhere ._. 
Have we summoned the presidents of Cameroon and Chad to take decisive action We have to hold our neighboring countries responsible ._. Don't pass the buck Mr ._. 
President ._. 
You failed ._. 
That is all I will say to that ._. 
HAS the chicken come to roost for 'Muungano' finally The answer is ,_,  we do not know ,_,  do we However ,_,  the debate on social media and indeed on print media is at its hottest even as the delegates to the constituent assembly continue on the road to self -_: destruction ._. When President Jakaya Kikwete assented to the demands for a new constitutional dispensation in Tanzania in 2010 ,_,  one would have been forgiven for thinking Tanzania would give Africa ,_,  the first real home -_: grown constitution ._. And why was that Under the first President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere ,_,  Tanzania was a voice of conscience of Africa in the matrix of world politics ._. 
At the United Nations ,_,  when Mwalimu spoke ,_,  those who had to take a break postponed and the hall hushed as the firebrand straight shooting Pan Africanist spoke ._. His word was seen as the word of non -_: Africa ,_,  as opposed to Kenya which was embedded in the back pocket of its former Master ,_,  Britain ._. 
These last two decades ,_,  the change of leadership has brought on a different set of thinking associated with the United Republic of Tanzania particularly from the perspective of the outside world ._. Former President Benjamin Mkapa was known to be a tough customer & negotiator ._. 
President Kikwete is the perfect gentleman known for his easy going manner and sense of humour ._. 
Somewhere along the line ,_,  Tanzania lost its place as the conscience of Africa and it is a matter for which not just the leadership alone ought to carry the blame ._. Look at Tanzanians ,_,  the obsession with everything foreign has become the norm rather than the exception ._. 
The desire to overtake those who started the race to westernise before us has consumed the populace ._. 
What is worse however ,_,  is the internalisation of the beggar mentality that has taken up the nation ._. It is common to hear such statements from the leadership :_:  we are receiving a lot of aid from all the developed nations because of our ruling party !_. 
Or ,_,  we are steering the nation well that is why our debts have been forgiven !_. 
Or ,_,  we are receiving aid and borrowing from international development finance bodies because our pay back record is good or our governance record is not questionable !_. Ok ,_,  let us be fair ,_,  somehow this sort of talk is very African on this continent excepting for South Africa ._. 
To the extent that the South Africans also say that sort of Affair is only possible in Africa as if they are in another continent but that is subject for discussion some other day ._. Nigeria's economy is bigger than South Africa's yet Nigerian University students have to pay to study in the Universities of Ahmadou Bello ,_,  Lagos  ,_, Nsuka and so on ._. 
Here's the catch ,_,  hundreds of thousands of Nigerian students spend billions of Naira to obtain University education in Universities all over the world from India to Australia ,_,  the UK to the United States ._. Both Nigeria and Tanzania are resource rich ,_,  the former in Oil and the latter in Gold and increasingly gas and oil resources ._. 
Nigerian oil  -_: has been a study of what a resource can become -_: a curse that has plunged the populous African nation in endless tragedies includes civil war and now ,_,  the Boko Haram killing spree ._. Tanzania has been relatively calm and still is ,_,  but beneath the veneer of calm ,_,  rumbles of discontent are being felt ,_,  which should solutions not be found ,_,  may result in a huge fissure that may be seen in the context of religious intolerance and the dissolution of the 50 year old Union between Zanzibar & Tanganyika that gave birth to the United Republic of Tanzania ._. In spite of his slender frame ,_,  Mwalimu Nyerere was a giant in his thoughts and actions ,_,  a philosopher ,_,  a great thinker and writer plus in many ways a pan Africanist with foresight ._. 
On the one hand he supported and recognised Biafra when it broke away from Nigeria arguably to save the people from genocide ._. On the other hand he was a serious Pan Africanist who saw Africa as one ._. 
In the past few years Zambia ,_,  Malawi even Zimbabwe have all had occasion to deny Presidential candidates an opportunity to contest for the Presidency on the basis of their supposed nationality ._. 
African and Africans are willing to open their lands to foreigners from China ,_,  India ,_,  South Africa & the west on condition they are not black ._. Are Africans so conditioned as to think any less of themselves Is this the reason we are happy to be receiving from donors US$100 ,_, 000 worth of laboratory equipment to assist our police set up a crime lab ._. 
Can Tanzania not afford to set up a crime lab from all its resourcesWhy do we clap when our leaders are narrating to us that we have recently borrowed when we know for a fact that billions of dollars find their way corruptly back to the isles of Man & Virgin Island ,_,  tax havens together with Swiss Banks ,_,  where the very same leaders stash away our children's futureThe future of Tanzania  ,_,  East Africa & Africa is dependent on sobriety in moments such as these in Dodoma ._. 
It is easy to debate power as they did in Kenya ._. 
The challenge is to forget power and debate social welfare and the day we take up that gauntlet and deliver ,_,  the world will stand up and respect us for getting our priorities right ._. As it were ,_,  we shall finish billions in Dodoma find ourselves throwing out the Baby with the birth water as we discuss who has the 'cheti cha ndoa' of Muungano while the real issue is can the sources of Tanzania be spread to give all Tanzanians a better chance at life !_.  ._. 
Alhaji Abdulai Abukari ,_,  Consul General of Ghana High Commission in Lagos ,_,  on Sunday expressed Ghana's readiness to partner with Nigeria to fight terrorism ._. Abukari told the News Agency of Nigeria NAN that Ghana's support had become imperative toward a successful war against terror ._. He said Nigeria also needed the support and cooperation of governments of member -_: states in the sub -_: region in fighting terrorists ._. The envoy said that his country would work closely with the INTERPOL and other international security agencies at the borders in tracking down gunrunners and those engaging in cross -_: border crimes ._. Presently as we all know ,_,  Nigeria ,_,  our brother country ,_,  is faced with the challenges of Boko Haram insurgents ._. There are reported cases of arrest being made at our borders of persons and groups moving arms from one country to another ._. Things like this will often exacerbate insecurity ,_,  terrorism and other cross -_: border crimes in the sub -_: region ._. Ghana is ,_,  therefore ,_,  looking at the possibility of collaborating with Nigeria through sharing of intelligence information on the movement of arms across the region ,_,  Abukari said ._. Abukari said that such partnership between both countries would not only reduce terrorism and insecurity in Nigeria ,_,  but in other West Africa countries ._. The consul general said that his government had realised that no country could fight insecurity and terrorism alone ._. He added :_: We strongly believe that our planned partnership with Nigeria in this regard will reduce activities of Boko Haram in Nigeria ,_,  insecurity and other cross -_: border crimes in the region ._. We all need to close ranks in promoting peace and security among West African countries as well as along the Gulf of Guinea ._. We all should be able to provide useful information to the relevant security agencies in tracking activities of terrorists and other cross -_: border crimes ._.  NAN
The Emir of Gwoza in Borno ,_,  Alhaji Idrissa Timta ,_,  on Sunday decried the renewed insurgency in the area ,_,  saying it had crippled the socio -_: economic activities in his domain ._. This is contained in a statement issued by the Emir in Maiduguri ._. According to the statement ,_,  it is unfortunate that our people have witnessed increased attacks with mass killings by the insurgents in the last four months ._. The attacks have crippled both social and economic lives in the entire area ,_,  the statement quoted the emir as saying ._. Timta said :_:  it is sad to say that my people have been blocked from going to the market by the insurgents ,_,  who kill at will ._. Even the food crops cultivated by them in the last farming season have ended up with the Boko Haram as the harvest were seized by the insurgents making life unbearable ._. There is an urgent need for the security agents to intensify and change their tactics of operation to stop the mass killings in this area ._. He said the insurgents had also killed many number people by blocking major highways ,_,  and appealed to security agents to intensify patrol on these roads to prevent the attacks ._. If care is not taken my people will completely flee the area to neighbouring states and countries for safety ,_,  he said ._.  NAN
The federal government projects in both troubled Borno and Yobe states will be completed on schedule despite the security challenge ,_,  the Minister of State for Power ,_,  Hon ,_,  Mohammed Wakil said ._. The Minister gave this assurance at the weekend in Maiduguri during a visit to the site of a 33 KVA transmission substation located along Damboa/Biu road in Borno state ._. Wakil said the Goodluck Jonathan administration remains committed to make the people of Yobe and Borno states happy despite the spate of Boko Haram attacks in the two states ._. 
Suspected members of the outlawed Boko Haram sect have invaded two Borno villages ,_,  Ngoshe and Kaigamari ,_,  in Gwoza and Konduga Local Government Areas killing 38 people and setting ablaze several houses and shops ._. They were also alleged to have destroyed GSM telecommunication masts and other property worth millions of naira ._. 
Ngoshe is located east of hilly Gwoza town ,_,  between Cameroon border with Nigeria ,_,  while Kaigamari is a remote settlement in Konduga ,_,  a town which has always been under the siege of the Boko Haram terrorists ._. Gwoza is about 140 kilometres south ,_,  while Konduga is 40 kilometres drive from Maiduguri ,_,  the state capital ._. 
It was gathered from a source that the gunmen ,_,  armed with Improvised Explosive Devices ,_,  petrol Bombs ,_,  AK 47 rifles and rocket propelled Launchers RPGs invaded Ngoshe at about 10pm on Saturday and opened fire on the already sleeping and unarmed residents ,_,  killing 30 of them and inflicting injuries on several others ,_,  before setting ablaze some residential houses ._. Also in Kaigamari ,_,  no fewer than 8 people were said to have been killed Sunday when another set of gunmen attacked the village and set ablaze some houses and shops ._. 
DELTA State is one of those geo -_: political entities in Nigeria where social and inter -_: ethnic re -_: engineering have proved abortive as its history since the cloning of the state in 1991 has been that of virulent acrimonious relationship among the different nationalities that make up the state ._. Since Gen ._. Ibrahim Babangida cloned a state called Delta ,_,  a hybrid of Igbo speaking and Urhobos ,_,  the Itsekiris and the Ijaws nationalities ,_,  neither the Anioma nationalities nor the so -_: called Core Delta region have had peace ._. The core Deltans who feel that Anioma people stole their capital have been belligerent because they feel that the Igbos want to use their oil money to develop their areas ._. 
This love -_: hate relationship continues to find expression on the pages of newspapers where ethnic hate mongers attack the people of Anioma ,_,  denigrate their heritage and cultural values ._. Things would be perfect in Delta State as long as the people of Anioma would not aspire to produce the next occupant of the Government House ._. 
The political elites from Delta Central and Delta South ,_,  believe that they own Delta State and the people of Delta North should be made to be hewers of wood and drawers of water ._. Even when the lion share of the revenue from the federation account ,_,  DESOPADEC and NDDC have gone into the pockets of their sons and daughters ,_,  with some trickling down as token projects ,_,  Anioma people continue to bear the brunt of their hate ._. Initially ,_,  the Urhobos had been most hostile and antagonistic in their attitude towards their neighbours ,_,  but over time this hate mongering attitude towards Anioma people ,_,  especially toward the people of Enuani and Oshimili areas of the state ,_,  has taken a frightening and murderous dimension ._. In fact ,_,  the virus has become comparable to the Nazi ideology and hatred which led to the Adolf Hitler -_: superintended holocaust against the Jews ._. 
It is not different from the jihadist ideology of Boko Haram ,_,  informed by religious bigotry ._. The culture of kleptocracy and sycophancy has been extolled to the highest levels ,_,  while the state and its citizens wallow in penury in spite of the resource endowments of the state ._. Only recently ,_,  a television footage of areas of Delta State affected by oil spillage exposed the shame of Delta State and the proponents of Urhobo dominance of the political system in the state ._. 
The footage revealed bizarre poverty of families still living in thatched mud houses ._. It must be clearly stated to these hate mongers that the people of Anioma are not political appendages or strangers in the Delta project ._. 
Gen ._. 
Babangida committed an unpardonable error by denying us a state of our own and lumped Anioma people in a union they would never have contemplated ._. 
Anioma people are in Delta State not by our choice and would prefer to be in their own state where they would realise their dreams for self -_: determination ,_,  extol their socio -_: cultural heritage and historical antecedents ._. Even within the politics of Delta State ,_,  Anioma people have provided the buffer for peace and development ._. 
In the ruling Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  it is on record that since 1999 ,_,  Delta Central has been the strong hold of the opposition party in the State ._. In the contest between Chief Moses Kragha of All Peoples Party ,_,  APP and Chief James Ibori of PDP ,_,  Chief Kragha won in Delta Central ._. 
He struggled in Delta South ,_,  but it was votes from Delta North that sealed victory for Ibori ._. In 2003 ,_,  the candidate of Alliance for Democracy ,_,  AD ,_,  Chief Great Ogboru won in Delta Central; again ,_,  Chief Ibori and PDP relied on the votes from Delta North to over -_:  come the challenge ._. 
This was the time two Urhobo sons were used to savage Chief Ibori in the ex -_: convict case ._. This trend continued in 2007 and 2011 when the opposition party voted against Dr ._.  Emmanuel Uduaghan in Delta Central ._. 
It was Delta North and Delta South that kept Uduaghan in power even with the judicial coup against him in Benin city ._. It is a fact that the Urbobos produced a Senator from an opposition party and they only returned to the ruling party after their years of opposition ended in futility ._. So where lies the morality of their claims that a region that has supported the PDP because of its ideology that power should rotate among the Senatorial districts ,_,  to ensure equity ,_,  justice ,_,  fairness and eliminate ethnic cleavages ,_,  marginalisation and give every body a sense of belonging should be alienated from the seat of powerThe other PDP states are implementing this policy ,_,  so Delta State is not an exception ._. 
In fact ,_,  PDP cannot afford to reward Delta Central which has over the years voted against PDP at the expense of Delta North which has been loyal over the years ._. Nigerians ,_,  including the Urhobos ,_,  the Ijaws and the Itsekiris ,_,  know that without any form of an informal power shift arrangement ,_,  the South -_: South region would never have access to the presidency and their argument to jettison that arrangement in the state would be their Waterloo in years to come ._. 
Whatever advantage that they think they are enjoying today is temporal ._. Even if Dr ._.  Emmanuel Uduaghan decides to go against the power shift arrangement ,_,  his Itsekiri nation would rue it in years to come ._. 
Whatever goes round comes around ._. 
Deltans are no fools ._. 
The idea of creating a culture of political dynasty did not succeed in Kwara State; Delta state would not be an exception ._. *Mr ._. 
Odoh ,_,  a public affairs commentator ,_,  wrote from Lagos ._. 
As the State of Emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa states expires this week ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan is in a dilemma over what to do ._. 
The military wants the emergency rule to continue but the stakeholders in the north -_: east including governors do not want further extension ._. The emergency rule that was further extended by six months would end on April 19 ._. 
The governors of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe  -_:  -_:  all of the opposition All Progressives Congress APC  -_:  -_:  and the political elites in Borno and Yobe have called for an end to the emergency rule which they believe have failed to achieve the targeted goal ._. A serving general told our correspondent during the weekend that ,_,  with the way members of the political elite are going about it ,_,  if the troops were forced to withdraw ,_,  the insurgents may come back and launch fresh attacks on the people with a view to recovering the ground they have lost ._. 
He said :_:  Those governors and the so -_: called stakeholders are not helping their people ._. 
Most of them are not living in their home states or at most they are living in the urban centres that are safe ,_,  but they should consider the common people who are being killed by these criminals on a daily basis; and ,_,  should we withdraw our troops ,_,  it would be suicidal for the masses living in those three states ._. We would make this clear to the commander -_: in -_: chief ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan ._. 
I am very sure there is going to be a meeting of the security chiefs next week where all the options would be laid bare on the table ._. 
Those calling for the withdrawal of the troops are up to something which we do not understand ._. 
I wish we knew it or they came out to say it loud and clear instead of attacking the military ._. Addressing defence correspondents in his office ,_,  on the 50th anniversary of the Nigerian Air Force ,_,  Air Marshal Amosu last week explained that the complexity of the operations against terrorism ,_,  anywhere in the world ,_,  makes it difficult to predict when it could end ._. 
But he gave an assurance that the elusive peace would have been restored before February 2015 to ensure the general election holds there ._. Don't forget that in the fight against terrorism and the insurgency ,_,  there are about four aspects involved :_:  you have the issue of the counter -_:  and the anti -_: ; the issue of political intervention and economic situation ._. 
But the first is that if there is no peace ,_,  the only thing you can do is the anti -_: ; you can go ahead with the counter -_:  and the anti -_: terrorism ._. 
The aspect of introducing economic activities is almost suspended if the peace is not there ._. 
There are variables that would prevent you from achieving your target date ._. But for terrorism and insurgency ,_,  you definitely cannot have a target date; even if you have put everything under control ,_,  you may still have sporadic attacks ,_,  a well -_: planned organized attack; one or two of these terrorists may show up with AK 47; even if it is one or two shots he fired ,_,  you know that is a terrorist attack ._. 
So ,_,  it is difficult to give a date ,_,  but I want to assure you we would continue working hard to ensure that we bring the entire situation under control ,_,  stabilise the place in good time before election takes place ,_,  he stated ._. Aside from the unpredictability of insurgency ,_,  the air chief also listed other variables that could stand on the way of ending the counter -_: insurgency war and called for cooperation from the citizenry if the war against terror would be over sooner than later ._. But don't forget that you have variables like weather ,_,  breakdown of equipment ,_,  machine and even the human beings can fall sick ._. 
Some variables are there that may not allow you to achieve your aim ._. 
So ,_,  we need the cooperation of the citizenry ._. 
With the information from the people about terror ,_,  80 per cent of the work is done ._. 
But when you do not get the information ,_,  it is a great problem ._. A competent Presidency source told our correspondent that President Jonathan is worried over how to handle the situation in a way that would guarantee the lives and property of the people in the three affected states ._. He is much aware of the impact the military presence is making in those states and he knows that ,_,  without their presence ,_,  there would have been more killings ._. 
But these politicians ,_,  for a reason best known to them ,_,  are asking for the withdrawal of the troops ._. 
What happens if the troops are withdrawn and these Boko Haram terrorists stage a comeback And the opposition may use the National Assembly to stall further extension ._. 
This is the situation but ,_,  before the week runs out ,_,  there would be a way out ,_,  the source said ._. 
Although the emergency rule expires this weekend ,_,  the troops may still be asked to remain ._. 
The president would ask the National Assembly to extend the emergency rule and ,_,  until the National Assembly decides ,_,  the troops remain ._. Another source argued that it's the failure of the Presidency and the National Assembly to suspend the democratic structures in the three states that is making the situation difficult :_:  If the emergency rule order had suspended the governors and the House of Assembly in each of the three states as it was done during the Obasanjo regime ,_,  things would have been different ._. 
All these people asking the military to go would have been seen cooperating with the Presidency to ensure the war is over on time ._. 
If the military is asked to stop fighting the insurgents ,_,  who would do it Is it the policeAll attempts made to speak with the director of Information for the Defence Headquarters ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade ,_,  failed ._. Military recovers stolen arms ,_,  livestockThe military assault on camps of armed militiamen in Kaduna and Plateau states has led to the recovery of arms and some stolen livestock ._. Soldiers have been drafted to quell attacks of militia men who have been killing innocent people in Plateau ,_,  Benue and Kaduna states ._. 
The operations in Dahia Luka ,_,  Makera and some communities in Plateau and Kaduna states resulted in the arrest of three wounded armed men after the encounter in which some of them died ._. Over 90 cows and 45 sheep believed to have been rustled were also recovered ,_,  in addition to weapons ._. 
About 50 other cows have also been recovered from rustlers who attacked herdsmen in another location ._. The recovered cows have been handed over to the traditional rulers in the area while the arrested armed men are still being interrogated ._. According to a statement issued and signed by Major General Olukolade ,_,  the herdsmen who were wounded by the rustlers are also being treated ._. 
Altogether ,_,  6 rifles ,_,  25 dane guns and 10 locally fabricated pistols as well as 4 revolvers were recovered in encounters with militias in parts of Plateau and Kaduna states ._. The statement further disclosed that traditional rulers in the areas have been cautioned against shielding or harbouring armed gangs in the precinct of their domain in view of the security implications to their communities and the nation at large ._. Armed gangs have been engaging troops in gun battle as the forests are being combed for remnants of criminal elements who have been wreaking havoc in various communities of the North -_: Central ,_,  the military stated ._. 
In the process of cordon -_: and -_: search ,_,  various rifle parts as well as empty ammunition boxes were recovered in Shendam ,_,  Yelwa and the house of a suspected arms dealer at the border between Plateau and Taraba states ._. 
The arrested suspects are among those being interrogated by the Special Task Force ._. 
Also ,_,  one of the militiamen arrested in the outskirts of Jos is already helping with information on his links with terrorists operating in other parts of the country ._. On the north -_: east campaign ,_,  the military disclosed that terrorists are being dislodged in the air and land raids while those dislodged are attacking travellers and some communities ._. 
The statement also disclosed how the troops repelled some terrorists at the weekend :_:  In the meantime ,_,  the counter -_: terrorist campaign in the North -_: East has continued amidst a series of encounters as identified make -_: shift camps of the terrorists are being dislodged in the ongoing air and land raids in forest and mountain locations ._. 
The presence of famished and unarmed members of the terrorist groups wandering around has been noted in some villages ._. Armed terrorists have however continued to carry out snap attacks on travellers on highways especially between Maiduguri -_: Damboa as well as Gwoza -_: Bama highways while others make occasional attacks on surrounding villages ,_,  looting especially food items ._. Some have been attacking soft targets in Borno and Yobe states apparently in retaliation for casualties incurred in their camps as a result of land and air assaults ._. 
Troops also repelled a weekend attack on Bunu Gari Market and no life was lost ._. Troops have been directed to maintain the aggressive patrols of the local communities to complement the assault on the terrorists ._. Gunmen kill monarch ,_,  37 others in Borno villagesGunmen suspected to be Boko Haram terrorists had ,_,  in the early hours of Sunday ,_,  attacked Kaigamari village in Konduga local government area of Borno State and killed seven people including the village head ,_,  security sources said ._. This occurred as gunmen were attacking Ngoshe -_: Sama village in Gwoza local government area of the state ,_,  where they killed over 30 residents ._. The gunmen who attacked Ngoshe -_: Sama village invaded the town at about 7pm and continued to operate up to the time of filing this report ._. A serving council member of Gwoza local government who craved anonymity said ,_,  The whole of Ngoshe -_: Sama has been burnt down and the people have fled; over 30 people have been killed so far; they are still there as I am talking to you now ._. A senior security operative in Maiduguri ,_,  who spoke with LEADERSHIP off the record ,_,  said the village head of Kaigamari ,_,  Bulama Kaigamari ,_,  was shot dead alongside six other villagers when the gunmen attacked about 2am ._. The gunmen went directly to the home of the village head ,_,  shot him dead and set his house ablaze ,_,  before attacking other villagers ,_,  said the security operative who also confirmed that several other people received bullet injuries ._. At Ngoshe village ,_,  a border community near Cameroon ,_,  sources said the attackers were armed with improvised explosive devices ,_,  AK 47 rifles and rocket -_: propelled launchers RPGs ._. Mallam Usman Jidda ,_,  a fleeing survivor from Ngoshe -_: Sama ,_,  said he managed to survive and made it to Gwoza town ._. Sources at Konduga said some of the injured victims were being treated at the Konduga General Hospital while the deceased were buried at noon yesterday ._. Muslims not using Boko Haram to islamize Nigeria  -_:  SultanMeanwhile ,_,  the Sultan of Sokoto ,_,  Alhaji Sa'ad Abubakar III ,_,  yesterday reacted to insinuations from certain quarters that Muslims want to Islamize Nigeria through the activities of the Boko Haram ._. He said such allegation was part of the agenda of groups like the Christian Association of Nigeria CAN and some individuals to discredit Muslims ._. The Sultan further stressed that the insecurity created in the northern part of the country by the Boko Haram sect should not be seen in any way as an attempt by Muslims to persecute Christians or turn Nigeria into an Islamic country ,_,  as more Muslims have also been killed by the insurgents ._. Speaking at the Golden Jubilee lecture of the Jamatu Nasril Islam JNI in Kaduna ,_,  the Sultan who is also the president -_: general of JNI said Christianity and Islam should not be seen as an accident of history ,_,  but as God's design which cannot be changed by anyone ,_,  adding that the main problem in the country is bad governance which ,_,  once tackled head -_: on ,_,  will address all other problems ._. He explained that the desire of JNI to criticise certain policies of the present government or demand their rights does not mean fighting the government or any group or religion ,_,  but should be seen as a wake -_: up call for government or those in leadership positions to do what is right ._. The Sultan however appealed to Christians and other faiths to join hands with Muslims to tackle the present security challenges and other problems facing the country and to also see Islam as a peaceful religion ._. The guest speaker on the occasion and a former Nigerian ambassador to Saudi Arabia ,_,  Professor Shehu Galadanci ,_,  in a lecture entitled Nigerian Muslims and the JNI :_:  Strengths ,_,  Achievements ,_,  Prospects and Challenges ,_,  claimed that Muslims in Nigeria are being marginalised in the political scene under the current dispensation despite their large population ._. Vice President Namadi Sambo in his goodwill message said the present administration has supported JNI in its programmes to tackle insecurity and illiteracy through the establishment of Almajiri model schools in many states in the north and also assured the body of federal government's effort to address the constant clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in some states ._. He quickly debunked allegations by the guest speaker that Muslims are marginalised under the President Jonathan administration ._. Governor Mukhtar Yero of Kaduna State said 50 years of JNI called for celebration and urged the apex Islamic body in the north to establish peaceful co -_: existence with the Christian Association of Nigeria and find possible ways of enthroning peace in the country ._. A highpoint of the occasion was the public presentation of the historical almanac of the association by the vice president ._. Air Force has the capability to keep the country's air space safe  -_: AmosuThe chief of air staff ,_,  Air Marshal Adesola Amosu ,_,  yesterday said the Nigerian Air Force NAF has the capability to keep the air space of the country safe and secured ._. He gave this assurance at the inter -_: denominational thanksgiving service to mark the 50th anniversary of the Air Force at the NAF Headquarters Protestant Church ,_,  Airport Road ,_,  Abuja ._. Said he ,_,  When the Air Force was established we went straight to war and ,_,  50 years after ,_,  we are still fighting war ._. 
The good news is that the capabilities that we demonstrated then due to limited technology has now broadened ._. Today ,_,  50 years after ,_,  we are still able to perform; I give full confidence to the nation that we will keep our air space safe and free of exuberances ._. The chief of air staff however said that one of the challenges the Air Force was facing is that of lack of spares for the aircraft ._. He said that most of the industry that provided the spares had folded up and ,_,  for spares to be available ,_,  it takes time ._. Amosu explained that most of spares were no longer in the market and that is why we brought innovative approaches to fix in some of these equipment ._. On the ongoing counter -_: insurgency operation in the north -_: east ,_,  the air chief said the collaboration among the services had greatly helped in the war ._. I want to say that jointness has come to focus ,_,  which is the principle and main philosophy of the armed forces ._. 
The situation is very clear; we are almost there ,_,  but the prayers must continue ._. Insurgency has crippled Gwoza  -_:  EmirThe emir of Gwoza ,_,  Borno State ,_,  Alhaji Idrissa Timta ,_,  has decried the renewed insurgency in the area ,_,  saying the insurgency had crippled the socio -_: economic activities in his domain ._. The royal father said his people have witnessed increased attacks with mass killings by the insurgents in the last four months in Gwoza ._. The attacks have crippled both social and economic lives in the entire area ,_,  the emir said ,_,  adding :_:  It is sad to say that my people have been blocked from going to the market by the insurgents who kill at will ._. Even the food crops cultivated by his people in the last farming season have been hijacked by the Boko Haram ,_,  making life unbearable ,_,  he said ._. He appealed to the security operatives to take a bold step to intensify and change their tactics of operation to halt the mass killings in the area ._. He said the insurgents had also killed many people in major highways and called on security agents to intensify patrol on these roads to prevent the attacks ._. If care is not taken my people will completely flee the area to the neighbouring states and countries for safety ,_,  he said ._. 
The year 2014 is turning out to be a disastrous one in Nigeria's history ._. 
You can take it from Boko Haram's insatiable murderous quest that has extinguished hundreds of lives ,_,  among them those of 59 school children in Buni Yadi in February ,_,  and their curious attack of Giwa barracks in March ._. 
Also in the same month ,_,  about 20 youths lost their lives in a shamefully conducted aptitude test by the Nigerian Immigration Service ._. 
Tracking back to January ,_,  there was the unnecessary and ill -_: thought -_: out antigay law signed by Goodluck Jonathan to pander to the Nigerian populace ahead of elections next year while thinking nothing of the many lives he has put at risk ._. Seemingly the most innocuous of these noxious events so far is the sacking of the CBN governor ,_,  Sanusi Lamido Sanusi ,_,  three months before the expiration of his term ._. 
It would seem preposterous to equate Sanusi's case with those in which lives were lost or put at risk ,_,  but his dismissal also has implications for the health and survival of our nation especially as it relates to the vital roles institutions play in making or breaking nations ._. Sanusi ,_,  though ,_,  was not going to quietly absorb his blows and lie low ._. 
Like a canary that would not stop singing ,_,  he published his defense to the President's suspension letter on March 16 ._. 
In the letter ,_,  he responded to the allegations of financial recklessness made by the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria ._. 
Since then ,_,  he has won a court case restraining the police from arresting or harassing him ._. 
The court also awarded him N50m compensation for government harassment against him ._. 
While both parties' resort to the judiciary is commendable ,_,  the whole episode became a melodrama of sorts ,_,  causing us to miss the bigger picture ._. Regrettably ,_,  a number of our public responses have been to coalesce around personalities ._. 
Even those who should know better ,_,  like respected lawyer Mike Ozekhome SAN ,_,  condoned the suspension ,_,  describing it as constitutional and within the ambit of the President's powers ._. 
This is incorrect ._. 
There is no such provision in the law to suspend and there certainly is no provision to remove without the approval of two -_: thirds of the Senate ._. 
Of course ,_,  he failed to point us to the part of the CBN Act that made it lawful or constitutional ._. 
On the other hand ,_,  an Abuja -_: based lawyer ,_,  Mr Aja Nwani Aja ,_,  countered that the sack had been done in bad faith ._. 
Aja acknowledged that Section 11 of the Interpretation Act provides that a president that appoints can also sack ,_,  but only to the extent that there is no specific act or law governing the position in question ._. 
In the case of Sanusi as the CBN Governor however ,_,  there is of course the specific CBN Act ,_,  and that renders the Interpretation Act null and void ._. 
This ,_,  for me ,_,  is a more honest rendering of the law ._. The same day Sanusi released his missive to media houses ,_,  the coordinating minister of the economy ,_,  Ngozi Okonjo -_: Iweala ,_,  was being interviewed on CNN ._. 
She sidestepped questions about Sanusi's dismissal and instead proffered a solution to the problem of entrenched corruption and under -_: development in Nigeria ._. 
It requires that we build institutions ,_,  she said ._. 
It is unglamorous ._. 
It is work that takes time ,_,  but we have to do it ._. 
If she were being more forthcoming ,_,  she would have admitted that suspending Sanusi does not help the cause of building institutions ._. 
It impairs it for two reasons :_:  it vitiates the needed independence of democratic institutions ,_,  and it is unconstitutional ._. That said ,_,  Okonjo -_: Iweala was right ._. 
Our history as a nation may not be long enough ,_,  but a recurring failure has been our inability to build strong and independent institutions ._. 
We have been far more obsessed with personalities ,_,  the region they come from and even the religion they practice ,_,  to the point that these people become an extension of our sentiments ._. 
When they leave the stage ,_,  reluctantly or otherwise ,_,  we take it personally ._. 
We saw that in the case of late President Umar Yar'Adua and the long delay before the then Vice President was sworn in as president ._. 
With Nigerians ,_,  it is not a case of soldier go ,_,  soldier come but barracks remain ._. 
When a soldier goes in Nigeria ,_,  he attempts to take the entire barrack with him ._. 
The effectiveness of our institutions has largely come to depend on the personalities leading them and not on established procedures that should guide their functionality ._. 
That is why little has been heard of NAFDAC and EFCC after the heady days of Dora Akunyuli and Nuhu Ribadu respectively ._. 
The resetting process that accompanies each glorious 'era' of an outstanding officer no doubt sets us back and affects our fortunes ._. 
Little wonder confidence in our public institutions has gradually eroded ._. It is therefore unsurprising that we are currently ranked 93rd of 99 countries examined under The World Justice Project rule of law index in 2014 ._. 
The problem is not that our institutions do not have sound operational procedures enshrined in law ,_,  but their implementation is mostly left to the discretion of the head of the institution ._. 
The law doesn't bind them ,_,  they bind the law ._. 
It explains why the accountability meter in Nigeria reads low ._. 
Not even the Minister of Interior whose incompetence and cluelessness caused so many deaths during an aptitude test that was paid for has been held to account ._. 
Expectedly ,_,  this kind of atmosphere corrodes nation -_: building effort and enables corruption to thrive instead ._. 
And here again we got a ranking of 97 out of 99 countries on the absence of corruption index ._. 
In the ranking of order and security within nations ,_,  we are one place from last position !_. 
Even Afghanistan floored us here !_. A careful consideration of our present political and economic reality leads to the conclusion that what we have in Nigeria presently is not a democracy ._. 
We can call it a kleptocracy ,_,  that is 'rulership' by a band of thieves whose overriding aim is to loot our commonwealth ,_,  the rest of the populace be damned !_. 
How much longer can we sustain the semblance of nationhood under these conditions Your guess is as good as mine ._. What is painful is that those in government don't seem to understand that our present economic circumstance ,_,  coupled with their disregard for the rule of law leads to a loss of legitimacy ,_,  a weakened democracy ,_,  and overall ,_,  a recipe for state failure ._. 
In lamenting the declining fortunes of democracies in the past decade and half ,_,  The Economist opined that democracy often fails because of the absence of rights and institutions that are equally important aspects of a functioning democracy ._. 
In their seminal book titled Why Nations Fail ,_,  authors Daren Acemoglu and James Robinson were even more forceful ._. 
They argued that countries differ in their economic success because of their different institutions ,_,  the rules influencing how the economy works ,_,  and the incentives that motivate people ._. 
What is needed for economic growth ,_,  the authors said ,_,  is an unbiased system of law and a provision of public services that provides a level playing field in which people can exchange and contract ._. 
The role of institutions in providing these functions cannot be overstated ._. 
It is mere wishful thinking to imagine a world in which our people are prosperous ,_,  our democracy is thriving ,_,  and our country achieves its great potentials when our institutions are crippled !_. For any country ,_,  institutions are critical to nation -_: building project ._. 
They must be independent to the extent required by law ._. 
The public officers manning them at any point in time must follow established rules governing how they are run ._. 
They must each understand their roles and act in sync like a well -_: trained military unit ._. 
All of them  -_:  the judiciary; institutions for fostering public integrity like the EFCC and the Code of Conduct Bureau; institutions for economic governance like the CBN and the Stock Exchange; institutions for public service delivery like the ministries and the civil service; political and security institutions  -_:  must be accountable to the public and provide the needed checks and balances to keep one another in line ._. 
They must be consistent ,_,  transparent ,_,  fair to all ,_,  and provide a level playing field for all citizens ._. This is one important lesson we must not fail to take away from the Sanusi debacle seeing how his saga has become another episode in the countless Nigerian dramas ._. 
Considering how quiet things have become in the past few weeks ,_,  I am afraid this might just be the conclusion of another seasonal film ._. 
We will hibernate until another major drama explodes ._. In justifying Sanusi's suspension ,_,  the President's Senior Special Assistant on Public Affairs ,_,  Doyin Okupe ,_,  said it was not an act of witch -_: hunting ,_,  neither is it a deviation from the anti -_: corruption drive of the Jonathan administration ._. 
It is laughable to even suggest there is an anti -_: corruption drive in Jonathan's administration ._. 
On his part ,_,  Sanusi's reaction to his sack was to express his concern for the system ._. 
He feared for it ,_,  he said ._. We all should too ._. 
We are probably five decades too late anyway ._. Mr ._.

The Sultan of Sokoto ,_,  Sa'ad Abubakar ,_,  on Sunday said there were no plans to turn Nigeria into an Islamic nation ._. Mr ._. 
Abubakar ,_,  who is also the President -_: General ,_,  Jamatu Nasril Islam JNI ,_,  and the head of Nigeria's Muslim community ,_,  made this known at the Golden Jubilee lecture of the JNI in Kaduna ._. Nobody can Islamise Nigeria ,_,  if Allah wanted he would have made everybody Muslims ,_,  so also with Christianity ._. 
God would have made everybody Christian if He wanted ._. He stressed the need for the people to set aside ethno -_: religious differences and be committed toward peace and development of the nation ._. The Sultan said JNI's criticism of certain policies of the present government was a wakeup call for the government or those in leadership positions to do what is right ._. He said that JNI's action was not aimed at fighting the government or any group or religion ._. Mr ._. 
Abubakar ,_,  however ,_,  decried the insecurity that had pervaded many parts of the nation ,_,  especially the North -_: East by the Boko Haram insurgents ._. He said that the activities of the insurgents should not be seen as an attempt by Muslims to persecute Christians or turn Nigeria into an Islamic country ._. Mr ._. 
Abubakar appealed to Christians and adherents of other religions to join hands with Muslims to tackle the present security challenges and other problems facing the country ._. He also urged them to see Islam as a peaceful religion ._. Vice President Namadi Sambo ,_,  in his goodwill message ,_,  said the present administration would continue to support JNI in its programmes ._. Mr ._. 
Sambo reiterated commitment of the Federal Government in tackling insecurity and illiteracy in the country ._. He also assured the Islamic body of the government's effort to address the constant clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in some states of the federation ._. Gov ._. 
Mukhtar Yero of Kaduna State urged JNI to play its role in defusing tension based on interpretations of Allah's revelations ._. This ,_,  Yero said ,_,  the Islamic organisation could do by encouraging Islamic scholars and preachers to dwell more on the five pillars of Islam ._. Yero said that the five pillars remained the core of the Islam and its unifying factors ._. He also stressed the need for the body to collaborate with other inter -_: faith dialogue organisations toward promoting peace and unity in the nation ._. The objective of such interaction is to devise means of promoting peaceful coexistence for the development of our great country ._. We all know that without peace and stability there can be no meaningful development because our country will economically stagnate ,_,  while majority of the people ,_,  irrespective of faith ,_,  wallow in abject poverty ._. It is ,_,  therefore ,_,  a collective responsibility ,_,  especially on the part of the JNI and similar bodies in the country ,_,  to galvanise the people toward achieving lasting peace and security ,_,  he said ._. The Speaker House of Representatives ,_,  Aminu Tambuwal ,_,  governors ,_,  traditional leaders ,_,  and Islamic scholars attended the occasion ._. NAN

The Boko Haram gunmen seem to be living out the threats by their leader ,_,  Abubakar Shekau ,_,  days after the Giwa Barracks attackGunmen believed to be members of the extremist Boko Haram sect on Thursday and Friday staged several attacks on Borno towns and villages ,_,  killing of at least 19 persons ,_,  including eight teachers ,_,  eyewitnesses and security operatives said ._. Since the ill -_: fated Giwa Barracks attacks that led to the deaths of at least 500 persons in Maiduguri ,_,  the Boko Haram gunmen seem to be living out the threats by their leader ,_,  Abubakar Shekau ,_,  days after by killing more people and inflicting pains on hapless communities ._. PREMIUM TIMES gathered that the gunmen ,_,  who witnesses said went from one village to the other may have killed more people than reported ,_,  as news of some of the attacks in the remote communities seldom get to the press or security agents immediately ._. On Thursday ,_,  at about noon ,_,  some of the gunmen attacked Kala -_: Balge village ,_,  located some 180km away from Maiduguri ,_,  where they shot sporadically ,_,  burnt houses and killed at least three villagers while others had to flee with various injuries ._. A senior official of the SSS confirmed the Kala -_: Balge attack to PREMIUM TIMES ._.

We were not sure of who and who they were attacking but most of the shooting was coming from the school area ,_,  It was later some of our relatives who did not run far away from the village called and informed us that they have attacked a boarding school and had killed eight teachers there; some of the women in the college were also missing ._. In a related ugly development ,_,  about eight travellers were were blocked and slaughtered by another detachment of the Boko Haram gunmen who operated along the dangerous Biu -_: Maiduguri highway that bothers the dreaded Sambisa forest ._. Some lucky travellers ,_,  who claim to have seen the scene of the attack ,_,  were in tears when they related the incident to journalists in Maiduguri ._. One of the travellers ,_,  a female who does not want to be named ,_,  said it was a very sorry sight; there was blood everywhere; human bodies were butchered like that of animals ._. 
I have heard of people being slaughtered but I have never witness such until today Friday ._. The remains of the victims are yet to be brought to any of the hospitals in Maiduguri as at the time of filing this report ._. 
Isiyaka Yusuf Onimisi ,_,  who live -_: twitted the March 30th attempted jailbreak at the State Security Service headquarter with the twitter handle @ciaxon ,_,  has been released after 12 days in captivity ,_,  his uncle ,_,  Mahmud Yakub ,_,  has said ._. Yakub ,_,  who spoke to Daily Trust ,_,  through phone ,_,  said he was released last night ,_,  but couldn't say who released him ._. The news of release of Isiyaka Yusuf Onimisi came in when activists had already started mobilising for a nationawide protest calling for his freedom wih the hashtag #freeCiaxon ._. Politicians like former Vice -_: President Atiku Abubakar ,_,  former World Bank Vice -_: President ,_,  Oby Ezekwesili and former FCT minister ,_,  Nasir El -_: Rufai ,_,  had called for his release after Amnesty International raised the alarm that the detained Citizen Reporter was at a risk of extra -_: judicial killing ._. When contacted yesterday ,_,  the spokesman of the Department of State Security Service DSSS ,_, Marylin Ogar ,_,  had declined to comment on whether the service had Isiyaka Yusuf with it or not ._. There had been fear that he might have been murdered by his captors after a story that alleged that he was beaten up after his arrest yeasterday ._. In a short video clip released Lawal Haruna with the twitter handle @lawalharuna ,_,  Isiyaka Yusuf said Wetin I want talk ._. 
I am just tired ._. Why he was arresstedThough security sources said he had been arrested on suspicion of link with Boko Haram ,_,  activist believe his arrest might be connected to one of his twits that suggest extra -_: judicial killing :_:  Tho I couldn't take a clear picx !_. 
But one of the attackers is caught and shot !_. 
Not confirmed dead yet !_. 
Strong negative reactions have trailed former Kano State governor ,_,  Ibrahim Shekarau's comment about the three states under Boko Haram siege and emergency rule :_:  Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe ._. Mr ._. 
Shekarau had said that it was more important securing the three states and indeed the northeast than conducting elections there in 2015 ._. This got many residents of the state upset; as Mr ._. 
Shekarau ,_,  currently being vilified as an agent of the PDP -_: controlled federal government ,_,  is accused of carrying out the bid of his pay masters by politicising the Boko Haram insurgency and the general insecurity in the northeast region ._. Speaking to journalists in Maiduguri on Saturday ,_,  a renowned Borno elder ,_,  Bulama Mali Gubio ,_,  said that it is very clear that former governor Shekarau has lost his mental balance since he left the APC All Progressives Congress and joined the PDP Peoples Democratic Party ._. Ibrahim Shekarau is a disgrace to the north as a whole ._. 
As a matter of fact with this statement coming from him on crucial matters like this ,_,  he has lost what remains of the little integrity in his person as a northerner ,_,  Mr ._. 
Gubio said ._. Mr ._. 
Gubio ,_,  who is also a former Head of Borno State Civil Service ,_,  pointed out that Mr ._. 
Shekarau's comments that the Independent National Electoral Commission ,_,  INEC ,_,  cannot conduct elections in volatile states is capable of denying most states of the north from holding the said elections as well ._. If he is insisting that elections would not hold in Borno ,_,  Adamawa and Yobe because they are volatile states; then he should note that it means elections would not hold in his state ,_,  Kano ,_,  because it is also one of the volatile states ._. 
In fact if Shekarau's statement is to be taken seriously ,_,  it means there won't be elections in Kaduna ,_,  Katsina ,_,  Plateau ,_,  Benue ,_,  Sokoto ,_,  and Nasarawa states ,_,  because all of them are volatile as it is now ._. So what Shekarau is suggesting is that there would be no elections in the whole of the north; and it is only a mad man that would prescribe the disenfranchisement of his people ,_,  just to please his pay masters ._. It is in the interest of the country at large for government to honestly confront the problems of insurgency and tackle it once and for all ,_,  rather than politicising it ._. 
We should remember Nigeria is a country made up of components and if one part of the country is sick the rest cannot pretend to be well ._. In his reaction ,_,  the pioneer chairman of the PDP in Borno ,_,  Ahmed Ashemi ,_,  also expressed his anger at the comment of Mr ._. 
Shekarau ._. His comment that elections cannot hold in states under state of emergency was not only intended to please some people at the highest level but also capable of sending a very wrong signal that could lead to chaos ._. It is an ill -_: conceived assumption or foreclosure of opinion that we in Borno and sister states of Adamawa and Yobe are not going to experience peace in the next nine months despite the efforts being made by the federal government through the security operatives ._. It is wrong and unbecoming of Shekarau to say that even with the provisos that 'if peace is not attained' ._. 
For God sake ,_,  the elections we are talking about are to hold in February next year ,_,  and we are in April today ,_,  Mr ._. 
Ashemi wondered ._. Mr ._. 
Ashemi alleged that the former Kano state governor is being used to play politics with the issue of insurgency ._. I am a card -_: carrying PDP politician ,_,  but I will never allow anyone to politicise the current security challenges in the northeast; I believe the issue of security affects all of us; and we have to put hands together regardless of politics ,_,  religion or tribal inclines to fight headlong the issue of insecurity ,_,  rather than playing politics with it ._. It will rather be very unfortunate for a man of that stature to stoop so low as to politicise such a sensitive issue in order to please somebody ._. 
I hope that is not what Shekarau is doing; if that is what he is doing ,_,  I condemn it as an individual ,_,  as a leader in my community and I condemn it in totality as a citizen of the Northeast who is so affected remotely and closely by these insurgency ._. The federal government has its sources of information that are superior to our own; and if the federal government truly thinks that elections cannot hold ,_,  such decision can only be taken when the time for the elections comes and not now ._. 
We don't want to hear any contemplation by anybody now that there wouldn't be elections in any of the three states under emergency when we still have more than nine months to get to the elections ._. 
We want to believe that the Federal government is really serious about crushing the insurgency and bringing about a lasting peace in the States ._. 
Hon ._. Philip Shaibu is the Majority Leader of Edo State House of Assembly and a former students union leader ._. 
In this interview ,_,  he expresses the fear that the activities of Boko Haram might disintegrate the country ._. 
He declares that President Goodluck Jonathan has not told Nigerians the truth on why Mallam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi ,_,  the Central Bank of Nigeria ,_,  CBN ,_,  Governor ,_,  was suspended ._. 
He also speaks on 2015 and other issues ._. Excerpts :_: You were very concerned when students were killed in Yobe State recently by Boko Haram ._. 
Are you satisfied with the efforts made so far by the Federal Government to quell the insurgencySecurity issue is not something that I like talking about because of the sensitivity of it but I think the Federal Government should listen to the cry of Nigerians; even the Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum spoke after their meeting and raised the alarm ._. And Mr ._. 
President should take seriously the statement of the governor of Borno State; they should not sweep the statement under the carpet ,_,  they should take it seriously and I didn't expect the security forces to react publicly ._. 
I saw Doyin Okupe reacting to the statement of the governor ._. 
Instead of responding to the statement of the governor ,_,  they should have gone in -_: house ,_,  discuss and look for solution ._. The response Nigerians are expecting is for them to resolve the problem If we don't take time as a nation ,_,  Boko Haram will seize the entire North and that will lead to the disintegration of the country ._. 
So we must not politicise Boko Haram like some persons are doing ._. 
Rather than tackle the issues raised by the Borno governor ,_,  some people were busy trying to please the President to the detriment of Nigerians who are being killed every day in those areas ._. National ConfabI see it as another jamboree that will bring all Nigerians together ,_,  make them busy and divert their focus from the real issues of governance ._. 
I don't want to pre -_: empt the outcome but I am sure that with what I have seen in the past -_: Vision 20 :_: 2010 ,_,  20 :_: 2020 and all of that ,_,  what they are doing is another visionless exercises ._. Looking at the composition ,_,  who will be in charge and how people will be mobilized ,_,  especially who will be the Chairman and the rules guiding the conference ,_,  it is obvious that it will be another jamboree ._. 
I believe in Sovereign National Conference ,_,  I don't believe in President Jonathan's conference ._. 
There is a whole world of difference between Sovereign National Conference and this Jonathan's conference ._. There have been comments that the conference is usurping the powers of the National AssemblyYes ,_,  we were all voted for to represent our various constituencies and ,_,  when we speak ,_,  we speak on behalf of our constituencies and ,_,  before now ,_,  questions are being asked about the present Constitution saying in the opening statement ,_,  we Nigerians ,_,  as if we wrote the Constitution ._. 
Who consulted us before the Constitution was enactedPeople say it is military Constitution but as time goes on it is gradually becoming the Nigerian Constitution because those that are now amending the Constitution are elected by Nigerians ._. 
But the truth is that I do not believe that the conference will end well ._. 
I want to see where the resolutions that will come out of the conference will be taken to because the President cannot implement them without the approval of the National Assembly ._. Your party ,_,  the All Progressives Congress ,_,  embarked on the registration of its members; what do we expect from the exerciseI am happy because what many people thought would happen didn't happen and Nigerians have seen that APC is a disciplined party ,_,  a party that is focused ,_,  a party with ideology ._. 
People always say that Nigerian parties are not based on ideology but I am confident that Nigerians are gradually seeing a party with ideology because our ideology has obviously shown from our membership registration and the turnout was massive ._. I think it is all about the wind of change ._. 
Nigerians are yearning for positive change which the party represents ._. 
It was very peaceful all over the country; in some areas where we had skirmishes ,_,  it was as a result of the opposition party ,_,  the PDP ,_,  that tried to do what they are used to doing by mobilizing people to disrupt the process ._. 
I am happy that we brought the exercise to a peaceful end ._. The APC recently lost Senator Ehigie Uzamere to the PDP ._. 
It is like it is a big blow to your partyI am not comfortable with it ._. 
But Uzamere is some body cleaned up by the Comrade Governor and the APC but he still decided to go back to where he came from ._. 
I think those who earlier said he should not have been given senatorial ticket were right and we were wrong ._. 
We believe in admitting our wrongs and rights too ._. But if you recall ,_,  Uzamere's election was the most difficult for the party to execute because many Benin people rejected him ._. 
Their argument was that he was not representing them but something else ._. 
For us ,_,  it is good riddance to bad rubbish ,_,  we are not losing sleep because he is a political liability ._. 
We have moved beyond him ._. 
For you to bite the fingers that fed you is a curse; so we leave him to God and the gods of the land ._. Do you not think that the process of searching for a suitable presidential candidate ahead of 2015 might tear the APC apartI am not losing sleep over it because we have leaders of integrity ,_,  leaders who are knowledgeable in politics ,_,  in the workings of Nigeria and knowledgeable in all what is happening in this country and they are also knowledgeable on how to fix Nigeria and that is what has resulted in a very strong ,_,  dynamic ,_,  viable and vision -_:  driven APC ._. And for them to have reached this point ,_,  I am convinced that God is with us and ,_,  if God is with us ,_,  He will give us a presidential candidate that will bring about that required change that our party represents ._. Sanusi's sackI don't know the criteria that were used to appoint him and I don't also know the criteria used to suspend him ._. 
But if it is because of his revelation that money was missing ,_,  I don't think they have solved the problem ._. 
The issue is whether money is missing or not ._. 
The number one banker in Nigeria ,_,  the governor of the CBN ,_,  said money was not remitted to him; I think the real thing is for the NNPC to remit that money to the CBN ._. NNPC should not sit down and tell us about spending money ._. 
NNPC does not have the right to dip their hands into our resources and tell us how they spend the money that is supposed to be in the Federation Account ._. 
Whether they remove Sanusi or not ,_,  we need that money ._. 
Lagos State governor ,_,  our own governor ,_,  all the governors were unanimous ,_,  whether PDP or APC ,_,  shouting that allocation was dropping ._. NNPC said oil theft was responsible and now we found that the small crude that was sold the money has not been remitted ._. 
I think the issue is to remit the money and whoever they have put there cannot cover the fraud if there was fraud ._. 2015Prof ._. 
Jega should know that he should write his name in gold ._. 
He is one man who has proven that he is a comrade ._. 
I want him to live up to his name as a comrade and one thing I like in him which we don't want to hear again is that he admits mistakes ._. 
The Anambra election was one that he admitted the failure of INEC ._. Unlike the past ,_,  Maurice Iwu would justify that the election was the most peaceful ,_,  most credible that we ever had and since he has identified that INEC goofed in Anambra ,_,  what I expect him to do to write his name in gold is to make good other elections that will take place in the country ._. 
Nigerians are law abiding but don't push them to the wall ._. 
Lagos � Lanre Suraj is a rights activist and the Executive Director of Civil Society Network Against Corruption CSNAC ._. 
Recently ,_,  his group petitioned EFCC to investigate allegation of corrupt practices against lawmakers in Nasarawa State House of Assembly ._. 
In this interview ,_,  he spoke to Sunday Trust what informed the group's decision ._. Your group once took interest in Taraba State ._. 
But now ,_,  you are in Nasarawa State ._. 
Why is your group showing special interest in Nigerian statesI think one of the things that is very instructive is the situation whereby many Civil Rights Groups tend to focus almost all their attentions on the Federal Government ._. 
But you will discover that there are lots of corruptions ,_,  frauds and mis -_: management going on at the State and Local Government levels ._. 
Thus ,_,  after critical analysis of the situations ,_,  we at the Civil Society Network Against Corruption came to the conclusion that there are many atrocities that political office holders go away with at the state level simply because civil rights groups and anti -_: corruption movements tend to focus mainly on the Federal Government ,_,  its agencies and parastatals ._. 
This is done to the detriment of the people whose internally generated revenues are being collected at the state level ._. 
But these revenues are not being used for the purpose they are meant for ._. And we have actually started lots of works in many local governments across the country ._. 
We have forwarded lots of petitions to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC and the Code of Conduct Bureau on the activities of some local government chairmen and their officials ._. You will also find a situation whereby costs of contracts awarded at the Local Government level is far more than that of the Federal Government for a similar project ._. 
The same thing also goes for the states ._. 
We have used the FOI Act to demand details of contracts being awarded by various state governments ._. 
So ,_,  for us as a rights organization ,_,  a time has come to strike a clear juxtaposition on what goes on at the federal ,_,  state and local government so as to ensure that the good governance which our people are yearning for are adequately delivered to them ._. So ,_,  what informed the decision to focus on Nasarawa State House of AssemblyOne thing we have observed over the years is the fact that there is this bandwagon effect that always plays out in Nigeria ._. 
When a menace breaks out and you fail to make immediate and conscientious effort to nip it in the bud ,_,  it becomes something that spreads to other parts of the country in a jiffy and before you know it ,_,  it becomes a normal way of doing things ._. 
And you can liken such situation to the menace of Boko Haram which after it thrived successfully in Borno state ,_,  moved to Yobe ,_,  Adamawa and now it appears the whole country is under the siege of Boko Haram ._. 
That is what is currently going on at the Nasarawa State Assembly ._. 
Whereas you have a state like Lagos State which has a monthly Internally Generated Revenue IGR of over N20 billion and a monthly Federal Allocation which is about that same amount or lesser ,_,  not awarding salaries and emoluments to its state legislators the way it is currently being done in Nasarawa State ._. 
And this is a state that takes about N3 billion to N4 billion as monthly allocation ._. 
Now ,_,  imagine this state awarding N30 million as constituency allowances on yearly basis for each of its 25 lawmakers and N10 million for transportation ._. 
That ,_,  of course ,_,  amounts to the fact that each of the lawmakers will be earning N40 million on annual basis for constituency projects ._. 
And before you know it ,_,  states in South West and South East regions where they do not even have oil ,_,  will start using Nasarawa State Assembly as a reference point ._. 
All over the world ,_,  parliamentarians are not known to be the ones who execute constituency projects ._. 
What they do is that they interact with their people at their respective constituencies and thereafter come up with a list of projects the people want executed within the area ._. 
When the contract is eventually awarded ,_,  it is the duty of the lawmaker to monitor and supervise to ensure that the project is adequately completed as budgeted for ._. 
However ,_,  the situation is different here ._. 
You have a situation whereby a lawmaker collects constituency project allocation and then becomes implementor of the project ._. 
He also appoints hiw own contractor ._. 
It is sad that a state like Nasarawa which is one of the poorest states in Nigeria is experiencing this from its own lawmakers ._. 
They collect N4 million monthly allowance ,_,  N10 million traveling allowance and N30 million annual constituency allowance ._. 
And this is a state that suffers from one of the worst in education ,_,  health ,_,  accommodation and shelter ._. Does that really make the lawmakers the highest paid in NigeriaOh ,_,  Yes ._. 
The Nasarawa State Assembly is the highest paid in Nigeria because this is one state assembly whereby whether you travel or not ,_,  you will collect N10 million travelling allowances ._. 
Then ,_,  N30 million as annual constituency project allowances as well as N4 million monthly allowance ._. 
Other states' assemblies might have other way of getting their monies ._. 
But Nasarawa assembly is the only one whose official states this bogus amount of money as allowances for ridiculous reasons ._. 
When all attempts to get documentations and certifications that all these constituency projects are truly implemented failed ,_,  that we now have to forward a petition to EFCC over the matter ._. Does your group have anything personal against the Nasarawa State House of AssemblyYes ,_,  we have everything personal against them ._. 
It becomes even more personal for me when I see that people who are elected to alleviate the problem of the masses are inflicting more pain on the same people they are to protect ._. 
Considering the fact that there was insinuation in recent time that the assembly is planning to impeach the Governor simply because a supposed party has majority members in the assembly ahead that of the governor's ._. Isn't it possible to suspect your group as being sponsored to divert attention from the governor and launch a witch -_: hunt on the lawmakersPart of the function of the lawmakers is to scrutinize the executive from time to time ._. 
And where a clear -_: case of maladministration ,_,  breach of oath of office or loss of trust of the electorates are established ,_,  then they have every reason to put the governor on his toes ._. 
And this they can carry out using every constitutional means within their reach to do so ._. 
But again ,_,  he who must come to equity must come with clean hands ._. 
It amazes someone that the House which operates with that level of scrutiny will be afraid to be so scrutinized ._. 
And what I even find amusing while reading newspapers these days is the fact that the assembly has threatened to impeach the governor more than five to six times within his less than three years in office ._. 
For me ,_,  that is the beauty of democracy if it properly carried out ._. Are you saying that the governor is not in any way financing your organization to do thisThere is no governor who can pay our organization to witch -_: hunt anybody ._. 
I think it is incumbent on the lawmakers to prove us wrong or let them come out and deny that all the figures we have against them are fabricated ._. 
And I think that is the only point we can be accused of being sponsored to witch -_: hunt ._. So ,_,  what is the current state of your petition to the EFCCThe petition has been submitted ,_,  while we are awaiting the eventual outcome of what their investigations will be ._. 
Already ,_,  we are being informed that the on -_: going investigation has been confirming certain infractions which we have also complained about ._. If the EFCC fails to act as expected ,_,  what will you doI think it would be too early to pre -_: empt that ._. 
I think in line with the decision of the Appeal Court ,_,  we can approach the EFCC to get progress report on the matter ._. 
Like you rightly pointed out ,_,  some people may start insinuating that we are being sponsored if at the end of the day nothing concrete comes out of this ._. 
So ,_,  we also have our integrity at stake ._. 
However ,_,  we thank God that we have been on this before the state assembly and the Governor started having their issues ._. 
Around 60 people are reported to have been killed and several others injured in an attack in northeastern Nigeria ._. 
Local officials have blamed the Islamist extremist sect Boko Haram for the attacks ._. News agencies on Sunday quoted two separate local officials who said the attackers struck early in the morning in a number of towns in Nigeria's Borno state ,_,  including Anchaka and Bama ,_,  while most residents were still asleep ._. The attackers ,_,  who are no doubt Boko Haram insurgents ,_,  attacked Amchaka and nearby villages this morning ,_,  hurling IEDs improvised explosive devices into homes and setting them on fire ,_,  Baba Shehu Gulumba ,_,  a local government administrator for the town of Bama ,_,  told the AFP news agency ._. They then went on a shooting spree ,_,  opening fire on confused residents as they tried to flee ,_,  killing 60 people and injuring several others ,_,  added Gulumba ,_,  who was speaking from Maiduguri ,_,  the capital of Borno state ._. Alhaji Baba Shehu ,_,  chairperson of the Bama local council gave the DPA news agency a similar account ._. They set ablaze houses and shot residents who tried to escape from the fire ,_,  Shehu said ._. More than 100 people had been reported killed during attacks in Borno earlier in the week ._. 
The Commissioner of Police in Borno State ,_,  Lawal Tanko ,_,  said no candidate for the JAMB examination that held nationwide on Saturday was killed in the state ._. Mr ._. 
Tanko was reacting to reports not by PREMIUM TIMES that 200 candidates were killed in one of the centres in Maiduguri by suspected Boko Haram insurgents ._. He told the News Agency of Nigeria NAN :_:  I was directly in charge of the police operations to ensure safety of the candidates in all the examination venues in Maiduguri ._. We conducted the examination in peace without any incident in all the centres in Maiduguri ._. As I speak to you ,_,  the students are on their way back home ._. 
So ,_,  I do not know which attack you are talking about in a JAMB centre in Maiduguri ._. I do not rule out the possibility of attacks on one or two candidates on their way to the venues or back home ._. I have not received any report of attacks on candidates either on their way to the examination or back home ,_,  he said ._. He advised journalists to always cross check information before going to press to avoid creating panic and disorder in society ._. NAN
The Deputy Chairman of the House Representatives' Committee on Security and Intelligence ,_,  Dr ._.  Edie Mbadiwe has tasked people in the insurgents prone areas on information about the insurgents ._. He said they should cooperate and work hand in hand with the security operatives by providing them with intelligence information that will help to deal with the insurgents around the areas ._. 
This will help a lot in the fight against the insurgents ,_,  he said ._. He argued that insurgency is not like the organized army ._. 
They are faceless and may just spring up unexpectedly and begins to attack people ._. 
He added that coupled with the fact that they are not a defined enemy ._. 
Once the army is around they run away to their hideout and strike at any available opportunity ._. 
This makes it difficult for the army to get rid of them at once ._. 
And the more reason why people in those areas should cooperate with the security agents and help them to identify the insurgents among them ,_,  the lawmaker said ._. He said the joint security forces of the Army ,_,  Air force ,_,  State Security Services SSS and the Police were doing their best to end insurgency in the North -_: East part of the country ,_,  saying Our Committee met with the security and intelligence agencies during its oversight function ._. 
We advise them and also ensure that all the equipment they needed are made available to them ._. The lawmaker ,_,  representing Ideato South Federal Constituency of Imo State in the House of Representatives on the platform of the All Progressives Congress APC in an interview with Sunday Trust said the National Assembly had put in place some measures to curb the insurgency ._. 
The House has made a lot of inputs on the issue of terrorism in the country but it's not what should be reported on the pages of newspapers because security matter is not to be disclosed ,_,  he said ._. Mbadiwe said Nigeria had competent Army  ,_,  Navy ,_,  Police force and SSS to fight the insurgents ._. 
There was a time the insurgency was almost getting out of hand but now the situation is calming down and the security agents are in control of the situation ._. 
The insurgency is coming to an end ,_,  the efforts of the security forces are yielding fruits ,_,  he said ._. It would be recalled that the House passed a motion sometime ago directing the Chief of Army Staff to relocate to Maiduguri and the senate Committee also followed that up ._. 
Mbadiwe said the Army headquarters had complied with that and relocated along with the logistics for operation in Borno State ._. 
I think the army is in the best position to make its strategies on how to fight the insurgents to the end so that we don't have Boko Haram making any come back againOn kidnapping ,_,  he said government was wining the war against kidnappers ._. 
For instance ,_,  we are lucky to have a good police commissioner in Imo State who is actually tackling the kidnappers ._. 
Some of them were arrested while some are awaiting trial ._. 
The state governor cannot relax in fighting them ,_,  if we relax they will come back again ,_,  he said ._. 
The outlawed Boko Haram sect launched attacks on troubled Borno town Thursday killing 8 teachersThe sect in the latest attacks on Thursday evening invaded three towns of Borno; Dikwa in the central ,_,  Gwoza and Kalahgde both in South ._. In the attack on yet to be identified school in Dikwa ,_,  some residents of the town who fled to Maiduguri revealed to journalists that the hoodlums killed eight teachers ._. One of them who spoke on condition of anonymity said some had to flee the town to Maiduguri ._. We could not sleep at night as all we were hearing was gunshot and we became afraid and had to sneak in the dark for Maiduguri ._. 
National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC ,_,  Professor Attahiru Jega ,_,  in an interaction with editors in Abuja last Monday ,_,  promised that the 2015 elections would be better than the one conducted in 2011 ._. 
Below are excerpts from the three -_: hour interaction ._. What amendments are you proposing to the National Assembly to Sections 31 and 87 of who should be the candidates of political parties in electionsWith regard to the electoral framework ,_,  all we are asking the National Assembly to do is to amend Section 31 and to remove the clause at the end of it ,_,  which says for any reason whatsoever ._. 
We don't think it is proper ,_,  particularly given the fact that Section 87 has said that candidates should emerge from democratic primaries ._. 
There is no need to say INEC should not reject nominations for any reason whatsoever ._. 
If the reason is that the candidates did not emerge from democratic primaries ,_,  then INEC should be able to reject that candidate ._. 
That is all we're asking in that respect ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  in this kind of discussion ,_,  people would say INEC is already asking for more powers ._. 
That is not the issue ._. 
I give you an example ._. 
If you leave that section ,_,  you know what happened in the past ._. 
If we are not careful and that provision stands ,_,  we'll enter into more serious crisis ._. 
For instance ,_,  the Constitution states that only Nigerians can stand for elective positions; and with the way our parties are going ,_,  they could put foreigners on the ballot and INEC cannot reject it whatsoever ._. 
This is quite ridiculous ._. All we're saying is that there should be sanity and consistency in the laws ._. 
Section 87 is beautiful; it will help to deepen democracy; we want internal party democracy ._. 
It is good that the section requires that candidates should emerge for internal party democracy ._. 
Why throw that away with the provision that says INEC cannot reject any candidate forwarded to it by the party for any reason whatsoever And we have seen how parties ,_,  before the 2011 elections ,_,  were sending us names of people who did not participate ,_,  or who had participated and lost ,_,  or who were unqualified ,_,  as candidates ._. The constitution has given qualifications for candidature ._. 
So all we were told was that they were internal party affairs ._. 
So ,_,  if INEC objected ,_,  it would be accused of restraining parties from exercising their right to choose their candidates ._. 
But INEC is also a regulatory body; we're supposed to regulate the process ,_,  using the Electoral Act ._. 
Therefore ,_,  if there are inconsistencies in the Electoral Act ,_,  they should be corrected ._. Is it possible to do all elections on a single dayThere are countries that conduct all elections on a single day ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  at this point in time ,_,  as I speak with you ,_,  we are hesitant to do elections on a single day in 2015 ._. 
We may be able to confidently do it in the future ,_,  but in 2015 ,_,  given all the logistical challenges ,_,  given the fact that we have been improving incrementally ,_,  we don't want to introduce something that can go the other way and you have a negative reversal ._. Logistics for organising all elections in one day are huge ._. 
Look at the large number of ballot papers you have to use and the large movement of materials and personnel that you have to do ,_,  and the challenges of lack of proper voter education in a country with a high percentage of illiteracy ._. 
All these complicate matters ._. 
What will happen is that on Election Day ,_,  you would give voters about five different ballot papers to put in five different boxes ._. 
Already ,_,  there are complaints about how our voters are not sufficiently educated and that they are wasting their votes ._. 
A lot of that wastage would occur ._. 
People would put ballot papers in different boxes ._. 
They will be confused in terms of which papers belong to what votes ._. 
Then ,_,  other people would come in to guide them ._. 
This would lead to chaos and confusion in the electoral process ._. People have complained that the order of elections this year is in favour of some political parties ._. 
In 2011 ,_,  we did National Assembly election first ,_,  then we did presidential election ,_,  and governorship and state assembly elections ._. 
Nobody complained about the sequence ._. 
Nobody said at that time that governorship should come first and presidential should come last ._. 
We have decided to do two elections instead of three ._. 
Let the one we did first and the one we did second ,_,  all come on the first day ,_,  while the one we did third ,_,  will be on the second day ._. 
That is the logic we have applied ._. 
But when you hear people talk ,_,  they would say 'we changed the sequence ._. ' We didn't change any sequence ._. 
They said 'there is going to be a bandwagon effect ._. ' When we did it in 2011 ,_,  was there a bandwagon effect The president was elected under the Peoples Democratic Party PDP ,_,  however ,_,  many PDP governors lost elections ._. 
Where was the bandwagon effect We did not design the timetable to favour or put anybody at a disadvantage ._. 
We did not alter the sequence of any election; we are consistent in terms of what we did in 2011 ._. Recently ,_,  I've been telling people an anecdote ._. 
People have been saying Kenya and Ghana did elections on one day ,_,  so why can't Nigeria The population ,_,  the terrain ,_,  the logistical issues are totally at variance ._. 
In terms of population ,_,  doing election in Kenya and Nigeria is like just doing a few states together ._. 
Not even that alone ,_,  the infrastructure in Ghana  -_:  communication ,_,  road network ,_,  transportation  -_:  are remarkably much better than they are in Nigeria today ._. 
Beyond that ,_,  even those who had done elections on one have said if they were given another opportunity they would not do it again ._. 
Last year ,_,  I was at a conference in Cambridge for Commonwealth Electoral Commissioners ._. 
The Kenyan Electoral Commissioner ,_,  fresh from the elections in Kenya ,_,  made a beautiful presentation ._. 
Everybody was happy with it ._. 
Then ,_,  somebody asked him a question is there anything you've done during this election ,_,  which if given the opportunity you wouldn't do it again' Almost instinctively ,_,  the Kenyan Electoral Commissioner answered :_:  'Doing all the elections in one day ._. ' In fact ,_,  after that ,_,  I cornered him and said I would take him to Nigeria to explain to my people how difficult it is to do all elections in one day ._. 
Really ,_,  we shouldn't bite more than we can chew ._. What we discovered is that the country is being railroaded into these arguments by politicians who are jittery about their fortunes as they participate in politics ._. 
All these issues about 'changing the sequence of election ,_,  bandwagon effect ,_,  doing elections in one day' ,_,  is an evidence of psychological mentality of some people who believe that they cannot win election until these things are done the way they like ._. 
But why If it is going to be bandwagon effect ,_,  it can go in either direction ._. 
People should just go ,_,  get the electorate; mobilise and get them to go out and vote for them on Election Day ._. 
I was even shocked when somebody called for an Electoral Act amended to day all elections must be conducted in one day ._. 
Everywhere in the world ,_,  Electoral Commissions are given the leeway to plan elections ,_,  set timetable on when to do it ,_,  but here ,_,  people want to tie our hands on this matter ._. You are supposed to be doing continuous registration of voters ._. 
How have you done that since the 2011 electionsThe way we have been trying to improve the integrity of the voters register is ,_,  first of all ,_,  through what we call de -_: duplication ._. 
This is to be able to identify cases of multiple registration ,_,  or to identify gaps in the details that have been captured ,_,  so that those gaps can be captured again in order to ensure that anybody in the register would have their registration properly done ._. 
I give you one example ._. 
When we did the registration in 2011 ,_,  the first two days were very challenging ._. 
Many people were going to vote and their fingerprints were not captured ._. 
Because there was overwhelming pressure and we had what we called special registration for people who didn't have fingers ,_,  we have trained our election workers in such a way that anybody who comes but doesn't have fingers should be treated under the special registration consideration ._. 
When they were confronted with the massive number of people whose fingers could not be captured ,_,  they started using special registration ._. 
So ,_,  many people who ,_,  ordinarily ,_,  should not have been captured under special registration were captured ._. 
We felt that it was necessary to clean up the register because for us to print a permanent voters card ,_,  there should be two fingerprints on the right hand and left hand ._. 
If you print a permanent voters card and there are no fingers on it ,_,  it cannot be read on election day ._. 
One of the things we are doing through the Continuous Voters Registration is to tackle the issue of those whose fingerprints have not been captured ._. 
We've done it now successfully in Ekiti and Osun states ._. 
That's what we're going to do in other elections as we move towards 2015 ._. The way CVR is mentioned in the Electoral Act is being misinterpreted ._. 
People think it requires that we must have offices all over the country ,_,  where between the hours of 8 ._. 00am and 4 ._. 00pm ,_,  anybody who has become 18 years of age can walk in and have their details captured ._. 
First of all ,_,  very few countries in this world have the capacity to do that ._. 
It means you have to set up offices ,_,  at least ,_,  at the ward level ._. 
If you set it at the local government level ,_,  you don't expect everybody in the local government to come to the headquarters to do voter registration ._. 
Technologically ,_,  we don't have the infrastructure ,_,  where somebody can go on a laptop or on a business centre and just have his details captured and uploaded into a database ._. 
We are far away from being able to do that ._. 
Practically ,_,  we cannot do continuous voters registration ,_,  meaning that anybody can walk into an office every day of the year to have his details captured ._. 
The way we interpreted Continuous Voters Registration ,_,  with the support of our lawyers is that 'continuous' means periodic ._. 
That is ,_,  periodic intervals before a general election ._. 
From one general election to another ,_,  you create structures and facilities that would allow all those who have not registered from the time the last registration was done till date to be able to come and have their details registered ._. 
That's what we have been trying to do ._. 
For example ,_,  there were about eight states where we had to do governorship election after 2011 general elections ._. 
In about six of those states ,_,  we made sure that we did CVR ._. 
What we are going to do now ,_,  before 2015 elections is to update the register in all the states ,_,  starting from May ,_,  so that by September we would have finished it in all the states of the federation ._. 
We would have updated the registers in good time before the 2015 elections ._. The Uwais Committee ,_,  of which you were a member ,_,  recommended the unbundling of INEC ._. 
You're now chairman ._. 
Why haven't you unbundled INECI was a member of Uwais Committee ,_,  as you rightly pointed out ._. 
We suggested that there should be a separate body which should try election offenders ,_,  so that INEC would have no business with the prosecution of offenders ._. 
We suggested that there should be a different body that should be registering ,_,  monitoring and regulating the activities of political parties ._. 
We also suggested that there should be a different body that should be doing constituency delimitation ._. 
Those were the recommendations ._. 
By doing that ,_,  INEC would be left with purely the business of organising and conducting elections ._. 
Since we came in in INEC ,_,  we have done an assessment and we discovered that perhaps ,_,  you can have separate agencies that are doing some of those things ,_,  but the registration of political parties is what we can easily do in addition to what we're doing ._. 
The procedure for registering parties is simple ,_,  and mostly paper -_: based ,_,  except for verification ._. 
INEC can do that in addition to its normal activities ._. Constituency delimitation is another issue ._. 
We discovered that the reason why it was not done was because of the controversies ._. 
It's argued that if you use technology to do it ,_,  it would be with minimal controversies ._. 
We thought that we could use technology ,_,  commence the process ,_,  and we can do it transparently and honestly ._. In many other countries ,_,  electoral bodies are not the ones doing constituency delimitation ._. 
But in some countries they do ._. 
Experience varies ._. 
In Ghana the Electoral Commission does constituency delimitation; in Kenya ,_,  the name of the body is Election and Boundary Commission; in many other jurisdictions they do the same ._. 
But the experience we had in 2011 is with regards to prosecution of electoral offenders ._. 
It requires a lot of our time and resources ,_,  and after all is said and done ,_,  for successful prosecution ,_,  we still have to rely on others ,_,  like police prosecution and investigation ,_,  and police first information report ._. 
It is difficult ._. 
When you do elections the police move to polling units; but after election ,_,  they go back ._. 
Even NYSC members who serve as electoral officers are moved to places other than where they are serving ._. 
After elections they go back ._. 
Therefore ,_,  to obtain the reports ,_,  and to bring them as witnesses to prosecute is time -_: consuming and resource -_: consuming ._. 
At any one time ,_,  INEC is bedevilled by court cases ,_,  because anybody who goes to court over election matters joins INEC automatically ._. 
And we have a very small legal unit to be able to do this ._. 
Before the 2011 elections ,_,  I did letters to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Senate President ,_,  asking that an Election Offences Tribunal should be created ._. 
It was not created ._. 
Then we have had more bitter experiences after 2011 ._. 
These recommendations we made for the amendment of the Electoral Act includes the creation of Election Offences Tribunal ._. 
If that is done ,_,  INEC would be unbundled from that responsibility and we can devote our energy and time in doing other things ._. 
Frankly ,_,  it's not easy ,_,  and we're always blamed ._. Why haven't you sanctioned politicians who have commenced subtle campaigns for 2015 elections when it is not yet time to do thatThe issue of campaigns is also very difficult ._. 
Three weeks ago ,_,  we had a meeting with political parties to raise these issues ._. 
They made a point ,_,  that we need to be very clear and categorical about what constitutes an electoral offence ,_,  with regards to campaigns ._. 
They are very skilful about how they do this campaign ._. 
If you go around you would see it ._. 
The Electoral Act says you cannot campaign to be voted to an office unless the nominations are over by political parties ._. 
If you want to be a senator ,_,  governor ,_,  president ,_,  you can't start saying 'vote me for governor' when your party has not nominated you for governor ._. 
But you can do a campaign that ,_,  'I'm contesting as a candidate of so ,_,  so ,_,  and so party ._. ' What our politicians do is that ,_,  from Day One ,_,  they start campaigning for governor or whatever ._. 
And they're very skilful about how they do it ._. 
If somebody comes out and puts a poster or billboard that says ,_,  'elect me for governor ,_,  senator or president in 2015 ,_, ' that is an outright breach of the law and we have evidence of people who have done that ._. 
But if people say 'An Achiever !_. 
Carry On !_. '  -_:  and you see a lot of that  -_:  there's little we can do ._. 
They are very skilful ._. 
You know what they mean ,_,  but you can't hold them to it ._. 
What we agreed with them at that meeting is ,_,  as at now ,_,  the guidelines are not very clear ,_,  so we've taken the responsibility ._. There are clear breaches; we have started documenting those breaches ._. 
Those ones we'll try and see whether we can commence prosecution with all the challenges and difficulties ._. 
Then ,_,  we'll provide additional guidelines that can help provide clarity in terms of what constitutes a breach of the Electoral Act ._. 
Now ,_,  we are facing some accusations ._. 
For instance ,_,  some parties would hold rallies and they would say they're receiving people who have decamped ._. 
Technically ,_,  so long as they don't use that platform to say ,_,  'vote for me' ,_,  they are not violating the law ._. 
But people are accusing us of not penalising those who are moving around ,_,  receiving members into their parties ._. 
There is need for that clarity; in the next few weeks we'll provide clear guidelines ._. 
Still ,_,  all the parties ,_,  at the highest levels are breaching the law against campaigns ._. 
When we raise these issues at meetings with political parties ,_,  they would say ,_,  'it's our adversaries who are doing this the campaigns ._. 
They say their adversaries print posters so that they would be accused of breaching the law ._. 
But again ,_,  they are just being clever by half ._. 
If somebody puts those pictures you should not allow it ._. 
They would say that those who put those adverts are sympathisers; that they didn't know about them ._. 
But the media can help us ,_,  by naming and shaming them ._. 
When you see anyone who is campaigning ,_,  you publicise it with photographs of evidence ._. 
We'll use your reports as evidence when we do prosecution ._. There is confusion over the directive you gave in 2011 of encouraging voters to stay and monitor the votes ._. 
When they stay ,_,  in many cases ,_,  they have problem with security personnel ,_,  who insist that they must leave after casting their votes ._. 
What is your true position on thisWe believe that if voters stay after voting until results are counted ,_,  it would minimise fraud ._. 
We've encouraged voters to stay ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  when we asked voters to stay ,_,  other politicians capitalised on it and even created the impression from the phraseology they are using ,_,  that are capable of creating tension and violence ._. 
But we've always insisted ,_,  because of the procedures we're using  -_:  simultaneous voting  -_:  it is possible to vote and wait until the votes are counted ._. Security agencies were uncomfortable before 2011 ,_,  and it took us a lot of arguments before they agreed ._. 
But there is a general agreement that before the last election ,_,  people can stay and see the counting of the result ._. 
But if a voter would stay ,_,  he has to conduct himself peacefully and orderly ,_,  otherwise the police can remove you ._. 
Therefore ,_,  there is no question any longer about people staying to witness counting ._. 
Of course ,_,  we still have reports by some observers that some overzealous security personnel drive people away ,_,  but it is largely a minority; it happens infrequently ._. In 2015 ,_,  are you going to hold elections in the North -_: East where we have security challengesThe security challenges are enormous ,_,  whether it is Boko Haram ,_,  or kidnapping or armed robbery ._. 
Elections can be conducted under situations of emergency ._. 
There are countries that have done so ._. 
But all we're saying is if we want free ,_,  fair and credible elections ,_,  they are better conducted when there are minimal security challenges ._. 
Recently ,_,  a report by a television station put me in trouble ._. 
I appeared before the National Assembly and a senator asked me that ,_,  with emergency in Yobe ,_,  Adamawa and Borno ,_,  would there be elections I took time to be frank and open ._. 
I said deepening democracy is about transparency and people coming out to vote without any fear to discharge their civic responsibilities ._. 
Ideally ,_,  there should be no election under a situation of emergency ._. 
This is because under emergency if you do an election ,_,  many things are likely to happen ._. 
Either people would not come out because they are afraid ,_,  or people will come out and run into security cordons and get physically assaulted or molested; or when they come out ,_,  if there is no sufficient security ,_,  they would be attacked ._. 
Under those kinds of conditions ,_,  ideally it should not be done ._. 
Then ,_,  I said ,_,  our hope was that before the 2015 elections there will be no emergency and security would have been restored to normalcy but we're prepared to conduct elections anywhere in this country ._. 
This aspect was not reported ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  other media repeated what the television station wrongly reported ._. 
Now ,_,  I would say we're ready to do elections ,_,  but we'll cross the bridge when we get there ._. 
Doing election is a function of many things ,_,  but as far as we're concerned we are preparing to conduct elections anywhere in the country in 2015 ._. 
We are hoping that the security challenges would be addressed before then to enable us conduct elections with minimal concerns ._. Do you have enough funds to conduct the next electionsYou've touched a raw point ._. 
In all countries ,_,  people are circumspect about discussing election budget ._. 
Elections are very expensive ,_,  but all countries do their best to provide funding ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  everything has to be discussed ._. 
We prepare our budget and appear before the National Assembly to defend them ._. First of all ,_,  in 2011 whatever we required ,_,  we were given ._. 
We were able to do elections without any financial pressure ._. 
As we move towards the 2015 elections ,_,  we have confidence that we can defend our budget and pray that whatever we require would be given to us ._. 
I can tell that in terms of financial autonomy or independence ,_,  this INEC is more autonomous and independent that the previous ones ._. 
We don't go to government cap in hand begging for money ._. 
Once the National Assembly appropriates our budget ,_,  we are under the first line charge ,_,  and we receive it from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN from the Statutory Fund Transfer Account ._. 
No other commission had that relative autonomy ._. 
This was done by the amendment to the Electoral Act in 2010 ._. 
But the challenge is ,_,  what you propose in the budget and what you need is not eventually what is appropriated by the National Assembly ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  the budget office gives 'envelopes' and it is what is taken to the NASS ._. 
Government says the lawmakers can reduce from the envelop ,_,  but not add ._. 
As far as we're concerned the envelop sent to NASS is far short from what INEC requires to conduct the 2015 elections ._. 
However ,_,  we have raised this with the Executive ,_,  Ministry of Finance ,_,  and the National Assembly ,_,  and there is a general understanding that whatever budget INEC defends as its financial needs for 2015 elections will be provided ._. Why are some elections inconclusive ,_,  including the recent one in Ilaje in Ondo StateWhen you conduct election ,_,  you don't want anybody to be in doubt as to who the winner and the choice of the people is ._. 
Whenever we say an election is inconclusive ,_,  it means on a legal ground that there are rooms to decide who is the choice of the people ._. 
And replying on the provisions of the Electoral Act ,_,  we have issued guidelines about how to ensure that a clear winner emerges ._. 
In Ilaje ,_,  you have hundreds of polling units ._. 
On Election Day ,_,  elections can be cancelled in some for irregularities; if there is violence ,_,  if somebody steals a ballot box ,_,  we cancel elections ._. 
When you are collating and you find that the total numbers of votes cancelled are more than the difference between the leading candidate and the runner -_: up then the election would be declared inconclusive because if elections had taken place in those places where elections had been cancelled a clear winner would have emerged ._. 
In Ilaje the number of votes between the leading candidate and runner -_: up is less than 2 ,_, 000 votes ,_,  but the difference between the number of votes in the polling units which were cancelled are about three times the difference between the leading candidate and the runner -_: up ._. 
We have to declare the election inconclusive ._. 
We have to arrange to conduct election in those places where elections didn't hold or were cancelled ._. 
When we do that we add the results to what we already have before we declare the winner ._. 
When we said Anambra Election was inconclusive recently ,_,  politicians raised hell ._. 
But they forgot that in 2011 ,_,  the Imo Governorship Election was inconclusive; we did supplementary election ._. 
In Anambra ,_,  Senator Ngige went to the Senate after a supplementary election between him and Professor Dora Akinyuli ._. 
But when we did supplementary election after the recent governorship election in Anambra ,_,  politicians turned around and opposed it ,_,  saying we must conduct a fresh election ._. 
Nobody came to our aide to say what we were doing was consistent with what we have been doing ._. You said the permanent voters card will last until 2019 ._. 
What happens when your successor comes and decides to produce new voters' cardsWe said if we have a permanent voters' card ,_,  we'll be able to do 2015 elections and we may be able to do 2019 elections with it ,_,  and hopefully ,_,  before 2019 we may have a good national identification card system which can replace a permanent voter's card ._. 
So we said we'll produce a smart card to improve the integrity of the election in 2015 ,_,  because one area of challenge ,_,  even though we prevented people from moving from one poling unit to another during the elections ,_,  still politicians ,_,  in 2011 used a scheme ,_,  and we all know it ._. 
They would buy voters cards from bonafide ,_,  legitimate voters card and give them to other people to go and do accreditation and voting ._. 
We said ,_,  in 2015 ,_,  we should be able to eliminate that ._. 
How Everybody would have a permanent voter's card ._. 
We have made sure that in producing that card there must be at least two right fingerprints and left fingerprints ,_,  which means they can be machine readable ._. We are going to use card readers in 2015 ,_,  so that when you come to accredit ,_,  you don't just rely on the person doing accreditation to verify whether he's the true owner of the card ._. 
The card would be read by a machine ,_,  and it must also be checked with your fingerprint ._. 
It's just a simple device ._. 
You swipe it and all your details would pop up ._. 
You put your fingerprint and then it would say using a micro -_: reader verified or not verified ._. 
So anybody in the immediate vicinity of the accreditation would hear whether you have been verified or not verified ._. 
If that happens and the party agents or others there still allow that person who is not verified to cast his vote ,_,  you can no longer blame INEC ._. 
It means there is high -_: level community connivance ._. We're trying to do authentication of holders of voters cards ._. 
We'll not stop politicians from buying cards ,_,  but it will be useless ,_,  until you can also asked the person from whom you buy the cards to come and vote for you ._. 
On the challenges like the batteries of the machines we have taken care of that; we'll provide spare batteries ._. 
At least 19 people have been killed within 48 hours Thursday and Friday in Borno State by suspected members of the Boko Haram sect whom may to have resumed killings weeks after the Maiduguri Giwa barracks attack ,_,  eyewitnesses and security operatives confirmed ._. LEADERSHIP Weekend had it on good authority that the Boko Haram gunmen had on Thursday evening invaded Dikwa village 130km away from Maidugui and attacked a college where they killed eight teachers and fled with some women ._. A fleeing resident of Dikwa who feared to be named in the media said ,_,  We could not sleep at night as all we were hearing was gunshots and we became afraid and had to sneak in the dark for Maiduguri ._. 
We were not sure of who and who they were attacking but most of the shooting was coming from the school area ,_,  It was later some of our relatives who did not run far away from the village called and informed us that they have attacked a boarding school and had killed eight teachers there; some of the women in the college were also missing ._. Earlier on the same Thursday another set of gunmen believed to be Boko Haram had in broad day attacked Kala Balge town about 100km away from Dikwa and killed three villagers ._. A top security source in Maiduguri ,_,  who spoke on condition of anonymity ,_,  confirmed the Dikwa and Kalabalge attacks to LEADERSHIP Weekend ,_,  but declined comments of details of damages ._. Similarly ,_,  another attack was yesterday Friday carried out along the Biu -_: Maiduguri highway by suspected Boko Haram members who waylaid vehicles near a village called Dalwa in Konduga local government area and slaughtered eight passengers ._. Travellers who saw the scene of the killing could not control their emotions as they wept profusely while relaying the incident to newsmen in Maiduguri ._. It was a very sorry sight; there was blood everywhere; human bodies were butchered like that of animals said a female traveller in tears ._. The Senator representing Borno Central Senatorial District ,_,  Ahmed Zannah also confirmed to journalists on phone about the attack ,_,  but differed that it was three teachers and two security men on duty that were killed ._. There was a siege on one of the schools in Dikwa town just after midnight on Thursday ,_,  said Senator Zannah ._. 
I got to know from my people in the area that the hoodlums attacked a school ,_,  killed three teachers and two security men on duty; they also razed the school library and escaped into the night through the bushes ._. 
FRCN seasoned correspondent ,_,  Gbenga Onayiga ,_,  captures some remarkable moments in Nigeria's quest for democracy in his 250 -_:  page book prelude to his retirement after 35 years of service ._. Nigerian journalists are fast joining the league of book writers and emulating their counterparts in developed democracies by churning out books based on their experiences while performing their reportorial duties ._. 
The latest insightful ,_,  scholarly and intellectually challenging work on contemporary Nigerian political history entitled Democratic Interface :_:  Memoirs of a Political Reporter written by a Radio Nigeria veteran political correspondent ,_,  Gbenga Onayiga ,_,  will enrich the book shelves on Tuesday ,_,  when it will be presented to the public at the National Press Centre ,_,  Radio House ,_,  Abuja ._. 
Nigeria as a nation has passed through various political experiences under military and civilian administrations ._. 
This has contributed significantly in shaping the future of the country ._. 
Gbenga Onayiga is evidently one of those so strategically positioned by providence to chronicle some of the major events that contributed to the shaping of the destiny of the nation ._. A ringside observer in the country's political evolutionary process ,_,  Gbenga had seen the intrigues ,_,  blackmail and other vices in their conduct ._. 
The book is a product of his personal experience in his chequered journalism career as a political reporter spanning about three decades ._. 
The work is the outcome of surveillance kept over the attitude of successive governments and the citizens thereby ensuring the checks and balances required in a democracy ._. 
The work is a clear demonstration of the reference to journalists as people who write history in a hurry ,_,  as Gbenga chronicles major political developments ,_,  particularly during the various transition programmes in Nigeria since independence ._. In furtherance of its constitutional injunction ,_,  the Fourth Estate of the Realm ,_,  as the media is usually referred to ,_,  has always been monitoring the activities of government and promoting strict adherence to the rule of law as well as the sustenance of democracy in the country ._. 
Right from the founding of the first newspaper in Nigeria :_:  Iwe Irohin ni Ede Yoruba by Reverend Henry Townsend in Abeokuta in 1859 ,_,  the media in Nigeria has been in the fore -_: front of defending the rights of the masses ._. 
It played the advocacy role and helped to check the excesses of the government ._. 
Indeed ,_,  the media led by nationalists like Dr ._.  Nnamdi Azikiwe ,_,  Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Ernest Seisei Ikoli ,_,  used the power of the pen to champion the attainment of independence for the country ._. 
It is therefore not an over -_: statement to conclude that the media ,_,  more than any other profession ,_,  suffered and sacrificed a lot in lending a hand to bringing about whatever success has been recorded in the social ,_,  political and economic life of the country ._. Nigeria can boast of having the freest and most outspoken press in the whole of Africa ,_,  one which has been credited for having helped in Nigeria's transition to civilian government ,_,  but also one which has consistently and understandably been the target of harassment by past military dictatorships ._. 
Many agents of Nigeria's press have been imprisoned ,_,  exiled ,_,  tortured or murdered as a result ._. 
Nevertheless ,_,  few still persevered ,_,  working to make the dreams of the founding fathers of Nigeria not to be in vain ._. 
Our nation today needs people like Gbenga Onayiga in the media profession ._. 
Men who are honest ,_,  true to the heart ,_,  self made men ,_,  men with conscience ,_,  steady as the needle to the pole ,_,  men who would stand for their right even if the heavens and earth reel ,_,  men who can look the world in the face and tell the truth ,_,  men who have courage without being domineering ,_,  men who know their place and fill it ,_,  men who know their message and preach it ,_,  men who would not lie ,_,  shrink or dodge ,_,  men who are not lazy to work ,_,  nor too proud to be poor ._. 
He is a trusted ,_,  visionary and committed journalist ._. The public service of Gbenga has given him a deep sense of commitment ,_,  honesty ,_,  enthusiasm ,_,  responsibility ,_,  the right mental attitude and other positive characteristics that are lacking in many in public positions which affect the lives of the less privileged in the country today ._. 
This book is primarily a general interest encyclopedia about trust ,_,  transparency and accountability of the media to the project called Nigeria ._. 
There has been a growing realisation that the mass media has been under -_: used in development ._. 
The key realisation has been that the mass media can be deployed in the fight against poverty ,_,  corruption ,_,  Niger Delta and Boko Haram insurgency as well as failing infrastructural development ._. 
There is also the need for an increased emphasis on good governance and strengthening democracy ._. 
The mass media is widely seen as playing a key part in supporting people's rights under law ,_,  and in holding politicians and officials to account ._. 
The book is written in simple language that is accessible to many grades of literacy ._. 
It is a must read for policy makers ,_,  critics of the media ,_,  teachers and students of history ,_,  education ,_,  sociology ,_,  anthropology ,_,  and political scientists at all levels ._. 
The book will no doubt give a fresh perspective and clear some doubts concerning this institution and at the same time arouse the very deep interest of the media in entrenching ,_,  deepening and sustaining democracy and good governance ._. 
The author deploys his powerful skill in political reporting to full effect and comes up with a captivating masterpiece that should enrich Nigeria's literary establishment ._. 
The book does not pretend to be a study of the media thought process and involvement in Nigeria's democratic experience ,_,  but it provides the basis for the study of emerging trends and paradigm shift of the use of the media in Africa's biggest democracy ._. 
It is obvious that the book is going to set standards for media treatises that is bound to flow as Nigeria's fledgling democracy finds firm footing in the years to come ._. 
The Senator representing Borno Central in the Senate ,_,  Zannah Ahmed has lamented over the early Friday attacks on four towns in Borno State by Boko Haram insurgents where he claimed that 210 people were killed ._. The senator claimed that the attackers were all dressed in military uniform and spoke English language which was a departure from the Hausa and Kanuri language spoken by the Boko Haram insurgents ._. He even lamented that the military post in Gamboru when it received a distress call from the people of Kala Balge avoided the town ,_,  claiming that it was not under its area of command ._. 
The senator who said he was compelled to speak out because his people were being killed on a daily basis and felt obliged to raise his voice; said what was happening in Borno was beyond understanding ._. It is a must for me to speak since peoples' lives are involved and they are my people ._. 
All these are happening in my constituency and it will be wrong to keep quiet ._. 
I feel so much pained and would have not love to speak but definitely my conscience will not let me do that ,_,  he lamented ._. 
He said 210 people were slaughtered by the marauders who dressed in military uniform and attacked the towns in two armoured personnel cars and seven double cabin pickups ._. According to him ,_,  they attacked a Teachers College in Dikwa and killed seven people ,_,  burnt down the school library and administrative block ._. He claimed that Kala Balge was the worst hit ,_,  where 60 people were killed by the armed men who went on rampage killing everything in sight ._. He said after they left Kala Balge ,_,  they went berserk and attacked three other towns in the area where a total of 150 persons were killed ._. Though he could not give exact names of two of the town at the time of filing the story last night ,_,  among the towns attacked was Gambulga ._. He said his people told him that :_:  Those people who attacked them were speaking English and could either be machineries from within the country or from outside ._. 
He stated the people spoke with some level of surety that those that attacked did not look like Boko Haram ._. He lamented that as he was presently speaking ,_,  the people of the area were fleeing to neighbouring Cameroon while some have already fled to Gamboru Ngala in the country ._. 
It was unfortunate that when the Army post in Gamboru Ngala were informed ,_,  they went back after covering few kilometres as the soldiers insisted that it was outside their command area ,_,  he regretted ._. 
Global rating agency ,_,  Fitch has affirmed Nigeria's long -_: term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings IDR at 'BB -_: ' and 'BB' ,_,  respectively ._. 
The agency also maintained that Nigeria's outlook remains stable ._. Fitch in a statement yesterday also affirmed the issue ratings on the country's senior unsecured foreign and local currency bonds at 'BB -_: ' and 'BB' ,_,  respectively ._. In addition ,_,  the agency with dual headquarters in New York and London also placed Nigeria's short -_: term foreign currency IDR at 'B' and Country Ceiling at 'BB -_: ' ._. Commenting on Nigeria's rebased Gross Domestic Product GDP which saw estimates for 2013 hitting $509 ._. 9 billion from $285 ._. 
56 billion and the country emerging as the biggest economy in the continent ,_,  the agency said the exercise showed a more diversified economy ,_,  with the non -_: oil sector comprising 86 per cent of GDP and services now put at 52 per cent of GDP previously 29% ._. According to Fitch ,_,  as a result of the country's new GDP figure ,_,  its sovereign and overall external balance sheets ,_,  current account surplus ,_,  debt service ratio and external liquidity are all stronger than the 'BB' category medians ._. It explained that the rating reflected the fact that the foreign exchange market and Nigeria's external reserves were stabilising after the shock that trailed the suspension of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi as the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN Governor in February ._. It added :_:  Demand for forex in the official auction reverted to normal levels in March and CBN intervention in the interbank market has fallen away ._. The interbank naira/dollar rate has strengthened from its lows although it remains outside the upper limit of the N155 plus or minus three per cent band ._. 
Reserves rose in March ,_,  helped by an increase in the Excess Crude Account ECA fiscal buffer ,_,  it added ._. It pointed out that although the external reserves had fallen appreciably over the past year ,_,  they remained in line with 'BB' category peer medians at a Fitch projected 4 ._. 6 months current account payments at end 2014 ._. 
This is however weaker than similarly rated oil exporters such as Angola and Gabon ._. 
It added :_:  Fitch believes that as an institution ,_,  the CBN has been strengthened in recent years and should retain its autonomy over monetary and financial policy ,_,  notwithstanding the suspension of the governor ._. Oil production remains volatile but rose in first quarter of 2014 to an average 2 ._. 25mb/d ,_,  in line with the trailing 12 -_: month average ,_,  and above the recent low of 2 ._. 1 million barrels per day in November/December 2013 ._. Improved production and increased efforts to tackle pipeline vandalism and oil theft may help explain the increase in the ECA in March ._. The issue of corruption in the oil sector and lack of transparency in oil flows has gained heightened prominence this year and the President has agreed to a forensic audit of the flows between state -_: owned oil company NNPC and the budget ._. 
Other factors supportive of the affirmation by Fitch included Nigeria's low debt burden ,_,  which after the recent GDP re -_: basing was just 12 ._. 6 per cent of GDP at end -_: 2013 and well below medians throughout the rating scale ._. 
Fitch's debt sustainability analysis also showed that the country's debt ratio would remain well below the 'BB' median in any plausible scenario ._. Nigeria's ratings are constrained by weak governance ,_,  as measured by the World Bank ,_,  low per capita income ,_,  even after the 89 per cent uplift to 2013 GDP due to rebasing ,_,  and vulnerability of public finances and reserves to oil price volatility ._. Political noise has increased this year ahead of the February 2015 presidential and gubernatorial elections ._. 
The Boko Haram insurgency has also intensified this year ,_,  though is geographically contained ,_,  it stated ._. Fitch therefore called for accelerated structural reforms to bring faster ,_,  more inclusive growth and higher employment and per capita incomes ,_,  among others ,_,  so as to enhance the country's rating ._. However ,_,  it listed renewed pressure on reserves that further depletion of Nigeria's fiscal and external buffers ,_,  reversal of key structural reforms and serious deterioration in domestic security as factors that could lead to a downgrade ._. 
It is not very often that defenseless civilians gunned down by overzealous security forces in Nigeria get the kind of verdict handed victims of the Apo killings by the Nigerian Human Rights Commission NHRC in Abuja last Monday ._. The commission's report indicted the Nigerian Army ,_,  the Directorate of State Security ,_,  DSS and the Attorney General of the Federation over the killing of eight squatters at an uncompleted building in the Apo/Gudu district of the Federal Capital Territory last September ._. NHRC had also awarded the sum of N135 million as compensation for both the eight deceased victims N80 million and the 11 injured persons N55 million ._. The eight victims who were alleged to be part of a Boko Haram cell in Abuja were shot at in the early hours of September 20 ,_,  2014 by a combined team of the Nigerian Army and the State Security Service ._. 
Eleven other persons escaped with gunshot wounds ._. The commission's report said there was no credible evidence to tag the eight young squatters killed as agents of the Boko Haram terror group ._. The security operation which claimed the lives of the victims was greeted by a public outcry that put the security forces on the defensive ._. 
SSS spokeswoman ,_,  Ms Maryline Ogar had said :_:  The operation was sequel to information obtained from two Boko Haram elements Kamal Abdullahi and Mohammed Adamu ,_,  who had earlier been arrested for terrorist activities ._. 
They led the security team to the uncompleted buildings where arms were purported to have been buried underground ._. 
No sooner had the team commenced digging for the arms than they came under heavy gunfire attack by other Boko Haram elements within the area ,_,  which prompted immediate response from the security team ._. But the NHRC report said :_:  There is no credible evidence to suggest or show that the victims in this case were members of JALISWAJ or involved in direct participation in hostilities ._. 
They were ,_,  therefore ,_,  protected ,_,  civilian non -_: combatants ._. The defence of self -_: defence asserted by the Respondents is not supported by the facts or evidence ._. Taking account of all the circumstances in this case ,_,  the application of lethal force was disproportionate and the killings of the eight deceased persons as well as the injuries to the eleven survivors were unlawful; and there is no basis in law for confining detainees freed by the Respondents to internal banishment ._. Sunday Trust had spoken with the survivors of the incident on their hospital beds and they insisted they were petty traders and Keke NAPEP operators at the Garki Market ._. Sani Abdulrahman from Safana in Katsina State ,_,  who was shot in the leg said :_:  The truth of the matter is that many of us sleep in the house ._. 
What happened was that on the fateful Wednesday ,_,  we learnt that some scavengers went to the house in the afternoon when we were away and stole some cables ._. They were caught by the security man in the house who said he couldn't handle the matter by himself and decided to call the owner ._. 
When the man came ,_,  he said they scavengers should be allowed to go ,_,  but he said all of us should leave the house by next Wednesday ._. 
He threatened that if we don't leave by next week ,_,  he would bring not police or SSS men but soldiers to chase us away ,_,  he said ._. Abdulrahman said barely 24 hours later ,_,  soldiers stormed the house at about 1 :_: 30 am and started shooting sporadically and many of them had to ran for their lives only to be shot by the soldiers ,_,  he explained ._. Abubakar Auwal ,_,  who hails from Bichi Local Government Area of Kano State ,_,  said most of the squatters were wheel -_: barrow pushers ,_,  auto -_: rickshaw tricycle or keke NAPEP drivers ,_,  labourers and traders who sleep in the house and leave as early as 6am for their various businesses ._. We were just going about looking for our legitimate means of livelihood ,_,  but they came and attacked us ._. 
We're about 200 who slept in the house and there was nobody like Boko Haram among us ,_,  he said ._. Bashir Usman ,_,  who escaped unhurt from the house ,_,  also protested their innocence ,_,  insisting they were not members of Boko Haram ._. The NHRC insisted not only did security agents violate the right to life of the victims ,_,  even the survivors suffered non -_: lethal violations of right to life ,_,  physical integrity and livelihood ._. The Army ,_,  DSS and the Attorney General's office were asked to pay N10 million to each of the deceased family and N 5million to the 11 injured youth ._. Regarding the order to banish some of the youth from Abuja ,_,  the NHRC said the security forces had no legal backing to exclude or internally banish citizens ._. The NHRC gave two months to the three agencies to review and harmonise rules of engagement governing the operations of security agencies and bring them into compliance with international standards governing armed conflicts ._. But the Nigerian Senate had last November cleared the security agencies of the allegations of extra -_: judicial killings in the APo operation ._. The decision followed the presentation of the report of the Joint Committee on National Security and Intelligence; and Judiciary ,_,  Human Rights and Legal Matters on the floor of the chamber ._. The report which revealed that the uncompleted building was owned by former President Olusegun Obasanjo's sister ,_,  Adunni Oluwole and managed by his son ,_,  Adekunle Salisu ,_,  was one out of dozens of uncompleted buildings raided by security forces in a bid to rid the FCT of criminals and miscreants ._. While presenting the report ,_,  the Chairman of the joint committee ,_,  Senator Mohammed Magoro ,_,  who described the incident as regrettable ,_,  noted that since January 2013 till that fateful day ,_,  security forces in FCT had carried out about 153 operations and arrests without firing any bullet ._. According to the committee report ,_,  the security forces embarked on the operation acting on intelligence report with a view to pre -_: empting a planned attack on some places in Abuja on September 22 ,_,  adding that the planned attack would have boosted the morale of Boko Haram sect if the agents had not succeeded in foiling it ._. The report added that the proactive move of the security agents to foil the plot went a long way to avert commotion ,_,  insecurity ,_,  high political and diplomatic embarrassment ,_,  disruption of government businesses as well as social services which he said would have accompanied the attack ._. The committee ,_,  also commended the State Security Services SSS over its perceived dexterity to secure intelligence ahead of the planned attack ._. Magoro also reported that the committee's investigation revealed the existence of Boko Haram cell in Abuja as well as the sect's plans to carry out various terrorist activities in different parts of the FCT ._. While disclosing that four of those arrested in the uncompleted building had confessed their membership of Boko Haram ,_,  Magoro added that majority of about 100 people living in the uncompleted building ,_,  whose source of income ranged from riding a tricycle to hawking ,_,  were oblivious of the fact that they were living with terrorists ._. Informing the chamber of the recovery of an AK47 magazine loaded with 30 rounds of 7 ._. 62 mm special ammunition at the scene of the operation by persons living in the neighbourhood who handed it over to DSS ,_,  Magoro also narrated how the earlier arrest of the duo of Kamal Abdullahi and Mohammed Adamu in Garki prompted the operation ._. He said following the arrest ,_,  the duo confessed plans by terrorists led by one Suleiman Musa now at large who lived in the uncompleted building to attack some churches and mosques in Abuja between September 20 and 22 ,_,  noting that as soon as the team arrived the scene with a view to cordoning it off ,_,  they were greeted with a range of gun shots which he said compelled the team to respond in the spirit of self defence ._. The proactive approach ,_,  he noted ,_,  was found compelling by the team bearing in mind the monumental destruction that would have followed the planned terrorist attack as well as the memory of how a number of the security agents had been butchered ,_,  burnt to ashes or missing while on duty in the last 12 months in Abuja ._. The property manager ,_,  Salisu ,_,  was said to have denied the allegation that he had earlier threatened to bring the police and the military to forcefully eject occupants of the building as well as the collection of certain amount of money from occupants on a daily basis ._. The report however ,_,  resulted in altercations as a member of the committee and a retired Army General ,_,  Senator Mohammed Saleh Kaduna Central ,_,  dissociated himself from the report ,_,  faulting the approach of the security agents to the operation ._. According to Saleh ,_,  who insisted that the killing was extra -_: judicial ,_,  it was unethical for the team to have killed some of the occupants ._. 
He said the security forces rather had the moral responsibility to ensure the safety of the squatters ._. He said the committee was not telling the chamber the truth ,_,  accusing it of derailing from its assignment to investigate the Apo killing and venturing into issues of terrorism ._. He was supported by Senators Sahabi Yau Zamfara North and Kabir Marafa who insisted that the killings were extra -_: judicial ._. But Senate Leader ,_,  Senator Victor Ndoma -_: Egba ,_,  said Saleh's criticism of the report of the committee in which he served was an ambush on the entire chamber ,_,  saying he had all the time to make his observation known while the assignment lasted but failed to do so until the final presentation of the report ._. In the same vein ,_,  Senators George Sekibo Rivers East and James Manager Delta South ,_,  faulted Saleh's submission ,_,  remarking that the war against terrorism differed largely from normal military operations ._. They also cautioned opposing views to be mindful of the danger that security agents are exposed to in the attempts to secure the lives of Nigerians ._. In the end ,_,  the Senate resolved to encourage security agencies to sustain the ongoing intelligence and military operations in the country to boost the war against terrorism adding that the federal government should continue to deploy all powers within its reach to defeat terrorists ._. The senators who also called on the federal government to supervise more closely the operations of security forces ,_,  advising governments at all levels to improve the quality of governance ,_,  reduce poverty ,_,  improve living standards ,_,  boost education and tackle youth unemployment ._. Now it remains to be seen if the SSS ,_,  Nigerian Army and the Attorney General will pay the victims the N135 million compensation ._. 
The federal government may be forced to explore options under the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act 2013 to continue to exercise emergency powers in the North -_: east states of Adamawa ,_,  Yobe ,_,  and Borno if the National Assembly fails to grant an extension of the state of emergency in the three states when it lapses on April 19 ._. At the moment ,_,  however ,_,  the Presidency and military authorities are keeping their options open and lobbying the federal lawmakers and politicians to approve an extension of the emergency rule to continue the offensive against the Boko Haram insurgents ,_,  investigation has revealed ._. Boko Haram ,_,  which claims to be fighting for the establishment of an Islamic state in northern Nigeria ,_,  has killed more than 1 ,_,  000 people since 2009 ,_,  when its uprising began ._. President Goodluck Jonathan had on May 14 last year declared a state of emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe ,_,  and Adamawa states in exercise of his powers under section 305 ,_,  subsection 1 of the 1999 Constitution ,_,  giving the military broader muscles to fight the insurgency ._. 
He had followed the emergency declaration with the transmission of its details to the National Assembly ,_,  where they were approved ._. 
In November last year ,_,  the National Assembly approved a request by Jonathan to prolong the state of emergency by another six months ._. The president is expected to return to the National Assembly this week to formally apply for another extension of the emergency rule ._. Already ,_,  there has been a lot of resistance ,_,  especially from the North -_: east ,_,  to the attempt by the Peoples Democratic Party -_: controlled federal government to extend the state of emergency in the three All Progressives Party states ._. 
The Northern Elders Forum ,_,  governors of the affected states ,_,  and lawmakers from that part of the country have insisted that there is no need for the extension ._. NEF ,_,  in a statement read by former Chief of Air Staff ,_,  Air Vice Marshal Al -_: Amin Daggash ,_,  at a press conference on April 11 in Abuja ,_,  threw its weight behind the elders of Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa states ,_,  who had been urging the federal government not to extend the emergency rule ._. 
In the same vein ,_,  the governors of the three states ,_,  Murtala Nyako Adamawa ,_,  Ibrahim Gaidam Yobe ,_,  and Kashim Shettima Borno ,_,  had in a recent joint statement opposed any plan to prolong the emergency rule ._. Their statement read ,_,  On the issue of extension of state of emergency ,_,  it is our considered view that there is absolutely no reason to even contemplate an extension of the state of emergency in any of the three states ._. It must be noted that a counter insurgency strategy that lasted one year without achieving the desired result requires a redefinition rather than extension ._. The federal government should always remember that it has the obligation of protecting the lives and property of all Nigerians in all parts of the country without necessarily putting them under any special condition ._. It has the option of putting a security structure in place that can continue and intensify ongoing counter insurgency operations without an extension of emergency rule ._. However ,_,  a security source within the Presidency stated that the federal government was considering invoking the anti -_: terrorism law because it was becoming increasingly clear that the opposition lawmakers in tandem with the demands of NEF ,_,  will vote against the extension ._. The source said ,_,  They are wasting their time and they will be surprised that with or without it state of emergency they security forces will carry out their operations ._. What they do not know is that the counter -_: terrorism law that has just been signed as amended has given us enough latitude to operate with or without the state of emergency rule ._. 
What we are doing under the state of emergency that is very crucial for the operations ,_,  including freedom to carry out arrests ,_,  search anybody and recover arms and freedom to detain suspects for extended periods of time ,_,  can as well be handled under the anti -_: terrorism law ._. It has not been tested and many people don't know the content ,_,  which provides sufficient latitude to operate without the cover of the state of emergency ._. 
I advise people to go and study it; it gives us additional powers and freedom granted under the emergency rule ._. Since it was signed into law ,_,  not much attention has been given to it and the reason being that state of emergency is in place ._. 
Therefore ,_,  we are just relying on that one and when it is not in place ,_,  as some people are advocating ,_,  we will rely on the counter -_: terrorism law ._. Section 261 of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act 2013 states ,_,  The Attorney General of the Federation ,_,  the National Security Adviser or the Inspector General of Police may ,_,  for the purposes of the prevention or detection of offences or the prosecution of offenders under this Act ,_,  give such directions as appear to him to be necessary to any communication service provider ._. Section 271 states ,_,  The court may ,_,  pursuant to an ex -_: parte application ,_,  grant an order for the detention of a suspect under this Act for a period not exceeding 90 days subject to renewal for a similar period until the conclusion of the investigation and prosecution of the matter that led to the arrest and detention is dispensed with ._. Section 29 states ,_,  The relevant law enforcement agency with the approval of the Attorney General of the Federation may ,_,  with the approval of the Coordinator on National Security for the purpose of the prevention of terrorist acts or to enhance the detection of offences related to the preparation of a terrorist act or the prosecution of offenders under this Act ,_,  apply ex -_: parte to a judge for an interception of communication order ._. In section 32 ,_,  the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act 2013 provides ,_,  The Federal High Court located in any part of Nigeria ,_,  regardless of the location where the offence is committed ,_,  shall have jurisdiction to  -_:  a try offences under this Act or any other related enactment ._. Speaking on the stand of the military and security forces ,_,  the Director of Defence Information DDI ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade ,_,  said they were bound to carry out operational directives by the president ,_,  who is the Commander -_: in -_: Chief of the Armed Forces ._. Olukolade said regarding the debate on emergency rule extension ,_,  Whatever be the outcome ,_,  the military is capable and prepared to keep discharging its constitutional duties in the most professional way as directed by the President ,_,  Commander -_: in -_: Chief ._. The essence will remain a commitment to ensuring due consolidation of the level of security already attained by virtue of the operations so far ,_,  but as envisaged by the political authority ._. Meanwhile ,_,  a lawyer ,_,  Mr ._. 
Yunus Abdulsalam ,_,  has warned against non -_: extension of the state of emergency by the National Assembly ,_,  saying it can create a constitutional lacuna needed by the insurgents to reverse recent gains ._. Abdulsalam counselled those opposed to the emergency rule to bring alternative solutions instead of simply condemning what has been a stopgap solution to the insecurity in that part of the country ._. If the troops are withdrawn ,_,  I doubt if it will not serve as licence for the insurgents to increase the volume of their attacks unhindered ,_,  he said ,_,  stressing ,_,  The presence and activities of the troops  -_:  though not perfect and needs improvement  -_:  surely salvages our hitherto visible descent to anarchy ._. 
The proponents of their withdrawal need to educate the government on how the withdrawal will bring peace and normalcy to the states ._. With the security challenges regrettably still making waves ,_,  it will not be out of place if the National Assembly extends it ._. Abdulsalam said governors of the affected states do not need to vacate their seats ._. It would be recalled that the Chief of Defence Staff CDS ,_,  Air Marshal Alex Badeh ,_,  had on assumption of office declared April as the targeted time to end terrorism in the North -_: east to avoid a constitutional impasse ._. 
The Defence Headquarters clarified this to mean a reminder to the service chief to take necessary steps to end the insurgency before the expiration of the emergency rule extension granted last November ._. Meanwhile ,_,  some lawmakers from the North -_: east have voiced opposition to the planned extension of the state of emergency in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa states ._. The member representing Gulani ,_,  Damaturu ,_,  Gujba and Tarmuwa federal constituency of Yobe State ,_,  Hon ._. 
Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim ,_,  called for the replacement of the emergency rule with a joint security taskforce in the three states ._. 
She said ,_,  I think we need to have all the help that we need to curb the insurgency ._. 
You don't have to impose a state of emergency ._. Hon ._. 
Goni Bukar Lawan ,_,  another House of Representatives member from Yobe State ,_,  said ,_,  We have never received any report on the security of the states and nothing concrete has been done by the police to take charge of the security situation in the troubled states ._. 
Another member of the House of Representatives ,_,  Hon ._. 
Hassan El -_:  Badawry ,_,  alleged ,_,  The federal government has not shown the desire to protect the people of Nigeria ,_,  particularly ,_,  the people of the North -_: east ._. He said the National Assembly would not approve any request for the extension of emergency rule in the affected states ._. 
At least 400 candidates in Borno State could not sit for Saturday's Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination UTME due to the security situation in the state ._. 
The Joint Admission Matriculation Board JAMB has however allayed the fears of such students and said it would make arrangements for them to write the exams using the Computer Based Test CBT model ._. There were reports of killing of some candidates ,_,  who were travelling to write UMTE ._. 
They were said to be among the several persons killed in multiple attacks allegedly carried out by Boko Haram in four communities ._. But JAMB debunked the reports ,_,  saying no UTME candidate was killed in the state ._. 
Speaking with newsmen while monitoring the conduct of the exams in Abuja yesterday ,_,  JAMB Registrar ,_,  Prof ._.  Dibu Ojerinde ,_,  said no JAMB candidate was killed in the attack ._. Yes ,_,  there was an attack ,_,  but they were not JAMB candidates ._. 
About 400 candidates who were supposed to go to Biu ,_,  decided to stay at home ,_,  and we would take care of them using the CBT ._. 
As long as they can use handsets ,_,  they can use the CBT method ._. 
It is not a big deal ,_,  he said ._. 
Last year ,_,  we had a problem in Wase ,_,  and we took them to Benue ,_,  gave them 15 minutes tutorials on the CBT and they did very well ,_,  he recalled ._. The JAMB boss had ,_,  at a recent press briefing ,_,  disclosed that there had been a significant decrease in the number of candidates ,_,  who registered for the 2014 UTME in the North -_: eastern region due to insecurity ._. Ojerinde added that while adequate 'confidential' plans had been put place to ensure the safety of the candidates from the region ,_,  the board would have to resort to employing the CBT for the candidates ,_,  if the environment is not conducive ._. The registrar ,_,  who monitored the centres at Baze University ,_,  and Digital Bridge Institute ,_,  amongst others ,_,  lauded the conduct of the examinations ._. Speaking earlier ,_,  the Supervising Minister of Education ,_,  Chief Nyesom Wike ,_,  assured the board that the government would provide all necessary support for the full take off of the CBT in 2015 ._. 
A total of 1 ,_, 606 ,_, 753 candidates were registered for the examination ,_,  which was a decline from 1 ,_, 735 ,_, 892 registered candidates last year ._. 
The 2014 figures include 174 visually impaired candidates and 196 prison inmates ._. Meanwhile ,_,  an auto accident involving three vehicles claimed the lives of two applicants of the Universal Joint Matriculation Examination UTME on Owo -_: Ikare Road in Ondo State ._. 
The accident ,_,  according to an eyewitness ,_,  involved a lorry ,_,  an Orange Colored Nissan Almera and a White Peugeot J5 van ._. The source said two of the three vehicles involved in the accident were coming from Offa in Kwara State when the accident occurred ._. 
The lorry was said to have overtaken the van while trying to negotiate a bend on the road before ramming into the car conveying the applicants ._. Confirming the Incident ,_,  the Head of Operations of the Federal Road Safety Corps FRSC in Ikare Akoko ,_,  Mr ._. 
Samuel Ibitoye ,_,  disclosed that two of the five UTME applicants died instantly while the other three were badly injured ._. Ibitoye added that the injured victims were immediately rushed to the Ikare Specialist hospital and Iwaro General hospital ._. 
He added that he remains of the two applicants had been deposited at the hospital morgue ._. 
The Centre for Law Enforcement Education CLEEN Foundation ,_,  yesterday said the activities of non -_: state actors especially those involved in security like the Civilian JTF tackling Boko Haram and the rising violence between herdsmen and farmers especially in parts of the North are the major threats to the 2015 general elections ._. Programme Officer of the foundation ,_,  Chinedu Nwagwu ,_,  who presented a paper at the third lecture titled Security Threat Assessment January -_: March 2014 :_:  Towards 2015 Elections in Abuja also said urgent attempt should be made to understand the political economy and dynamics of cattle rustling in the country as the situation is not all about military action ,_,  but having a better understanding of situation to develop a better response mechanism ._. The altercation between the PDP and APC about which of them is behind the Boko Haram insurgency also raises tensions and could impact on the elections if not checked ._. The security situation has been dominated by cattle rustling ,_,  banditry ,_,  assassinations ,_,  ritual killings ,_,  political skirmishes and rapes ._. 
Two different cases of violence in March 2014 killed over 200 people in Katsina and Kaduna States alone ,_,  Nwagwu said ._. Another threat to security in the North East may likely come from the Civilian JTF CJTF in Borno currently hailed for their gallant counter terrorism efforts in the state ._. 
The CJTF are currently heavily armed with machetes ,_,  knives ,_,  daggers to fight insurgency ,_,  but it is reasonable to assume also that some of the heavy weapons acquired from encounters with Boko Haram may remain in their circulation which could be readily used for intimidation during the forthcoming elections ._. Executive Director of the organisation ,_,  Ms ._. 
KemiOkenyodo among others urged the government to reverse the reverse the entrenched culture of impunity through the prosecution of perpetrators of violence by the police and the judiciary; and to also reduce the level of small arms in the country by implementing the Presidential Committee on Small arms and the Presidential committee on Post Elections violence reports ._. 
I think the state of insecurity in Nigeria is increasingly becoming alarming ._. 
Last week Sunday ,_,  it was reported that some suspected Boko Haram members arrested and detained at the Asokoro headquarters of state security attempted to escape and in the process ,_,  some security officials were wounded while all the arrested suspects were killed in what the official statement claimed was cross fire ._. I am not an expert in the area of security or intelligence andtherefore incapable of x -_: raying the statement in relation to the situation at hand but one thing that is becoming clear is that if care is not taken ,_,  the chicken is about coming home to roost ._. When the Deputy Governor of Borno State told me early in 2013 that at the time the insurgency began in MAIDUGURI MUNICIPALITY ,_,  EVERYONE IN THE N EIGBOURHOOD THOUGHT IT WAS a local matter that did not concern them as such looked the other way ._. 
Before long ,_,  the problem had infested the whole of the state and even began in the neighborhood of Yobe and then Gombe and subsequently other parts of Northern Nigeria ._. Most of us in the North are today going to sleep with our two eyes open due to fear of the environment ._. 
From Boko Haram in the North -_: east and North -_: west ,_,  what we are witnessing today is a new phraseology of herdsmen in the North -_: central area wreaking havoc on lives and property ._. The essence of this analogy is to bring to the notice of those who are in authority and are of the belief that this crisis is restricted in limit and space to begin to think otherwise because even if truly there are no invisible hands in the crises as some conspiracy theories seem to be suggesting ,_,  the lackadaisical manner in which the government initially perceived and handled the social insurrection in the North -_: east and subsequently North -_: west has contributed immensely in the near collapse of national security ._. One will not be completely wrong to posit that life in Nigeria today is typical of the Hobbesian state of nature ._. 
It is short ,_,  it is nasty and it is brutish ._. 
The consequence of the action or inaction of the state means that the problem could go national and if the State Security Department's story is to be accepted ,_,  the meaning of the Sunday 'jailbreak' attempt and the subsequent fire fighting that occasioned the operation speaks very loudly about the state of the nation ._. I want to think that there is still quite a substantial misconception or deliberate desire to properly understand the nature of insurrection by those who decide on our behalf ._. 
There are still men in government who believe that the insurgency is political or supported by politicians from the North ._. 
There cannot be any untruth far from this and I am of the view that such beliefs in the first place were responsible for the aggravation of the crisis ._. If government had acted with the necessary patriotism and wisdom ,_,  the problem would have substantially been nipped long before now ._. 
The painful part of it is that there are very many of them upstairs who still harbor such a myopic views and thus are unable to bring to bear the synergies necessary to address these obvious national calamities ._. Again ,_,  the conspiracy theories suggesting government's tacit involvement in the state of insecurity in selected parts of the country have variously explained where the security agencies were caught flat -_: footed ._. 
The incidents of attacks on schools and how military road blocks were arbitrarily removed just before the attacks and the massive attacks on unsuspecting communities in especially the North -_: central states of Benue ,_,  Taraba and Nasarawa ,_,  as well as the callous massacre of tens of people by unknown gunmen in Katsina State ,_,  in the last few weeks give credence to some of these theses ._. Those who hear should hear and know that their actions or inactionsare making insurrection a Nigerian problem ._. 
If anybody is in the illusion that the state of insecurity in the country is containable only when it reaches certain parts of the country ,_, that person must be mistaken ._. 
It seems to be growing with massive force and is seemingly uncontainable unless honest and truthful strategies are adopted ._. If anybody was in the illusion that what happened at the headquarters of the SSS was impossible ,_,  the Sunday March 30 episode was an eye opener ._. 
The meaning of that is that nobody is safe and nobody is protected in the country ._. Our call is as always ,_,  government must be honest and sincere in this fight against insurgency and must do everything possible to address the issue genuinely ._. 
Those security agencies that are eating fat on the insurrection must be made to stop and face the reality ,_,  which the country is in today ._. It is no doubt that some security officials have made brisk business out of this unfortunate situation ._. 
They turned the whole thing into money making venture at the cost of very many human lives ._. 
Such officials can never for the rest of their lives go to sleep peacefully ._. My fear as always is that our country is grinding to a halt ._. 
We are lawless followership and greedy leadership ._. 
I share the view that corruption may not be Nigeria's number one problem but impunity ._. 
Things happen as if we are in the literary animal kingdom ._. The essence of civilization is government and the essence of government is regulation ._. 
We are so unregulated and deregulated and cannot continue that way if we are to survive ._. 
It is possible for change to happen but that must first begin with the leadership who can then deploy reward and sanction on members of the society ._. As it is now ,_,  things are really out of shape and they need to be corrected ._. 
That is why we have insurrection ,_,  that is why we have indiscipline and corruption and that is why both leaders and the followership are behaving with impunity ._. 
A nation cannot grow under such an atmosphere of confusion ._. 
Things must change and for the better but first at the level of leadership ._. 
As the May deadline for the expiration of the emergency rule imposed on Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe States ,_,  draws near ,_,  service chiefs have begun exploring the options of ending the insurgency in the North -_: east ._. THISDAY gathered yesterday that although the service chiefs were favourably disposed to extending the emergency rule to finally rout Boko Haram insurgents in the zone ,_,  they were considering other options in view of the gathering opposition from Northern leaders to the extension of the state of emergency on the three states which President Goodluck Jonathan first imposed on the states in May 14 ,_,  2013 ._. At the expiration of the first six -_: month stanza of the state of emergency imposed on the states ,_,  the president had sought and got the approval of the National Assembly to extend it for another six months last November ._. 
THISDAY findings within the security circle showed that the military chiefs ,_,  at the meeting of the security council with the president on Friday would argue for the renewal of the emergency rule on the states ._. But it was learnt that they were canvassing for lifting of the state of emergency on Adamawa State ,_,  where attacks by the insurgents were not as intense as in Borno and Yobe States ._. However ,_,  Northern leaders are against extending the emergency rule for the second time in the two states ._. 
It was their opposition that made the federal government to consider invoking the terrorism law to check the insurgency should the Northern leaders succeeded in persuading the National Assembly not to grant the president's request for renewal ,_,  if he sends it to the legislature ._. A military top chief said :_:  We have recorded successes against the insurgents ,_,  but what we are desirous of is having total victory ._. 
And based on this ,_,  we are going to recommend to Mr ._. 
President for an extension of the state of emergency ._. 
It was gathered that the military high command had been meeting with a view to adopting a common position during the enlarged security meeting that is scheduled to take place on or before Friday with Jonathan ,_,  Vice -_: President Namadi Sambo ,_,  the National Security Adviser NSA ,_,  Col Dasuki rtd ,_,  among others ._. Another source said :_:  I can tell you authoritatively that the service chiefs will certainly call for an extension of the state of emergency in Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe States to enable them flush out the insurgents completely ._. 
The military does not want to leave the job half done ._. 
If the military withdraws now ,_,  the pockets of the insurgents scattered around will regroup and start again ._. If we don't crush the insurgents totally ,_,  then we would have lost the battle and initiative to them ._. 
We cannot afford that because it will be disastrous ._. The other reasons ,_,  the military are demanding an extension is to enable its officers and men conduct searches ,_,  hold suspects beyond 48 hours for proper investigation ._. 
Honestly ,_,  speaking ,_,  the state of emergency has not deprived the people of anything ,_,  except the occasional restrictions in movement ,_,  he added ._. However ,_,  ahead of the expiration of the emergency rule ,_,  some elders from Borno and Yobe States have urged the federal government not to renew it ,_,  saying there would be no justification for doing so ._. Last week ,_,  the three governors of the troubled states ,_,  Murtala Nyako Adamawa ,_,  Ibrahim Gaidam Yobe and Kashim Shettima Borno also said there was no reason to contemplate an extension of the state of emergency in any of the three states ._. 
Commenting on the position of the Borno and Yobe elders that terrorists have continued to wreak havoc in spite of the state of emergency ,_,  a senior military officer ,_,  told THISDAY that ignorance of the nature of the war against terror was responsible for such unguarded comments ._. He said :_:  we are fighting a group who has nothing to lose ,_,  who are under erroneous assumptions that they are fighting a religious war ._. 
For them ,_,  the more the damage they wreck ,_,  the happier they become because they have no code of conduct ._. 
It is a difficult war but we have risen to the occasion as our intelligence gathering has improved ._. Also ,_,  the National President of the Nigerian Security Watch Forum ,_,  Mallam Abubakar Dabaki ,_,  said it was obvious that the elders were merely playing politics with security issues ._. He said :_:  If the so -_: called elders are in denial about the need for the extension ,_,  the military cannot do so ,_,  having sacrificed this much and gone too far ._. 
The Emir of Fika knows why he said so; he cannot rule his domain from outside ,_,  ditto Air Marshal Daggash rtd ._. 
The fact of the matter is that Senator Zannah and Ambassador Babagana Kingibe cannot remember when last they visited home ._. 
Yet they want state of emergency lifted ._. However ,_,  the federal government has been advised against extending the ongoing state of emergency rule ._. 
The residents of the states argue that extending the emergency rule ,_,  will increase the apprehension in the area rather than lead to immediate resolution of the Boko Haram crisis ._. The people of the area said if the reign of terror by the Boko Haram cannot be sustained in the last one year that emergency rule was slammed on the three states ,_,  then the federal government should know that it is the right time to change strategies ._. 
Having read Waziri Adio's piece entitled 'Dasuki ,_,  Metuh and Boko Haram' and published on the back page of THISDAY Newspaper on Monday ,_,  March 24 ,_,  2014 ,_,  I have to caution that when a brilliant journalist like Adio comes into the public arena to push a point of view ,_,  it is important that he transparently declares his interests instead of masking them ._. Since Adio failed to do the honourable thing ,_,  as a citizen journalist ,_,  I have a duty to expose those interests ._. 
Adio failed to tell his readers that he is a long term paid consultant of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi ,_,  the suspended Central Bank of Nigeria CBN Governor who coincidentally graces the cover of the latest edition of Adio's magazine ,_,  Metropole ._. 
As a citizen journalist ,_,  I know that Adio ,_,  working in tandem with Muyiwa Adekeye Nasir el -_: Rufai's Media Assistant coordinated the media who were invited to listen to Sanusi disrespect the president at the $500 a night Intercontinental Hotel rather than address the substance of the charges for which he was suspended ._. Adio is a core member of the All Progressives Congress APC who pretends to offer innocent information to unsuspecting members of the public ._. 
He cannot deny that he was a participant at the event where the APC manifesto was unveiled with him acting as a delegate and coordinating activities ._. 
It is important that we understand that the perspective Adio offered were not value free ,_,  they were procured ,_,  partisan and tainted ._. 
Now to address the few issues in his piece ._. Adio is selling assumptions as facts ._. 
He deliberately assumes that Reno Omokri is the author of the document that x -_: rays Sanusi because of the electronic signature on the document ._. 
If Adio is tech savvy ,_,  he would have realised that in 10 minutes or less ,_,  he can create an electronic signature in the name of Omokri or even United States President Barrack Obama ,_,  a fact that can be corroborated by Adio himself if he cares to search for the how -_: to video tutorial on YouTube ._. 
In fact ,_,  in a BBC feature The Curious Case of Wendell Simlin Carlo De Micheli ,_,  an independent security expert ,_,  says the evidence adduced by the APC apologists can't be taken as concrete proof ._. Adio makes an article whose authorship has not been authenticated except by APC propagandists who falsely accuse Omokri the centrepiece of his arguments ._. 
Why did he choose to ditch one of the ethics of journalism When in doubt ,_,  live out Because he is paid and has to justify his earnings to his paymaster !_. 
Having accused Omokri ,_,  Adio tried to be clever by half by ignoring the substance of the said article ._. 
Waziri cannot 'unring' that bell ._. Since he chooses to make the article an issue then let me quickly refresh the memory of Nigerians ._. 
In 1995 ,_,  a crowd led by about 15 individuals seized one Gideon Akaluka ,_,  an Igbo resident in Kano ,_,  whom they accused falsely as it turned out of defiling the Quran ._. 
They then supervised his beheading and barbarically put a spike on his head and danced round the streets of Kano ._. 
Sanusi was one of those individuals arrrested in connection with the incidence by the late Gen ._. 
Sani Abacha's administration and clamped into prison ._. 
Of the 15 arrested ,_,  Sanusi should be forever grateful to Alhaji Umaru Mutallab for saving him while all others were executed ._. 
Sanusi schooled in the Sudan at the same time Osama bin Laden lived there ._. It is curious and suspicious that while Sanusi traced every type of criminal funds ,_,  he has been unable to trace even one naira of Boko Haram funds until his suspension from office as CBN Governor ._. 
This is especially so considering that he introduced electronic cash system of tracking and tracing funds ._. 
This is the reason why Sanusi is desperate to distract attention from the main issue ._. 
The way and manner his paid and unpaid defenders are going about this matter should make intelligent people pause and wonder ._. 
As Shakespeare said in Hamlet ,_,  The lady doth protests too much ,_,  methinks ._. 
Why are the Sanusi defenders ignoring the most dangerous issues and trying to make non issues ,_,  issuesThe Sanusi choristers' overly frequent and vehement attempts to convince others that there isn't strong circumstantial evidence that should cause us to look again at Sanusi's past with regards to his possible radicalisation ironically helps to convince others that the opposite is true ._. 
They are making Sanusi appear insincere and defensive ._. 
Consultant Adio should advise his principal ,_,  Sanusi ,_,  to respond to these facts ._. And when Adio writes that Anyone with a passing familiarity with the history of Boko Haram knows that the sect predated the 2011 elections by almost a decade ,_,  he betrays a prejudiced mindset that is only seeing the problem from the prism of his paid interests ._. 
No one is denying the fact that the Boko Haram sect predates the 2011 elections ._. 
What many people are saying is that the escalation of the sect's activities can be directly linked to the rise of President Goodluck Jonathan to power ._. 
Even a paid spin doctor like Adio cannot deny this ._. Now ,_,  the above fact hardly seems a coincidence when you juxtapose it with the statement by Alhaji Lawal Kaita on October 9 ,_,  2010 that The North is determined ,_,  if that happens ,_,  to make the country UNGOVERNABLE for President Jonathan or any other Southerner who finds his way to the seat of power on the platform of the PDP against the principle of the party's zoning policy ._. When you consider that Sanusi has made similar comments in the past such as the one he made against the leaders of the South -_: west in Afenifere :_:  Syllabus of Errors published by THISDAY on September 27 ,_,  1998 then there are indeed reasons to ask cogent questions ._. 
It should also be remembered that Sanusi had called former military President Ibrahim Babangida a man of a lower culture ._. 
If he thinks such of a former leader ,_,  imagine what he thinks about others not from his culture !_. 
It is this type of Janjaweed mentality that makes the APC conducive to Sanusi and Sanusi to the APC ._. In my opinion ,_,  rather than engage in a flight of fancy ,_,  Sanusi should respond to the issues and while he is at it ,_,  he may also respond to the issue of why he committed Nigeria's funds to causes that appear to have personal significance to him and his personal future ambitions Adio ,_,  the consultant ,_,  should also not accuse others of politicising the Sanusi matter ._. 
He should google pictures of the day Sanusi returned from Niger Republic after he was suspended and let them guide him as to who began the politicisation of this issue ._. 
Sanusi politicised himself long before his fall from grace as evidenced by the admission of APC functionaries who confessed on camera that they indeed got multi -_: billion naira contract from the CBN under the leadership of Sanusi ._. 
Are APC members the only Nigerians who know how to execute contractsConsider the facts !_. 
The people that welcomed Sanusi back from Niger Republic were top APC chieftains ._. 
His lawyer is a notorious member of the APC who has provided legal services to the party and continues to do so ._. 
Finally ,_,  Adio must be honourable enough to tell the public where he stands at all times ._. Between 2012 and 2013 ,_,  Adio vigorously lobbied the Secretary to the Government of the Federation SGF to be made the Director General of the Consumer Protection Council CPC ._. 
Adio also reached out to prominent people countless times in his desperation to get that job ._. 
It is to the credit of the SGF that an APC mole was prevented from getting the CPC job ._. 
He would have been worse than Sanusi ,_,  a man who does not respect the president yet wants to benefit from his administration in a classic case of wanting the honey without respecting the bee ._. 
Just as there was no moral ground for Adio's ambition at the CPC ,_,  there is no moral ground for writing his jaundiced piece ._. 
Suspected members of the outlawed Boko Haram sect invaded three villages ,_,  Ngoshe ,_,  Kaigamari and Anchaka in Gwoza ,_,  Konduga and Bama Local Government Areas in Borno State at the weekend ,_,  killing about 98 people and setting ablaze several houses and shops ._. They were also alleged to have destroyed telecommunications masts and other property worth millions of naira ._. 
Ngoshe is located east of hilly Gwoza town between the Camerounian border with Nigeria ,_,  while Kaigamari is a remote settlement in Konduga ,_,  a town which has suffered several attacks by Boko Haram terrorists ._. Gwoza is about 140 kilometres south ,_,  while Konduga is a 40 -_: kilometre drive from Maiduguri ,_,  the state capital ._. 
It was gathered from a source that the gunmen ,_,  armed with improvised explosive devices IEDs ,_,  petrol bombs ,_,  AK 47 rifles and rocket propelled launchers RPGs ,_,  invaded Ngoshe at about 10 pm on Saturday and opened fire on the already sleeping and unarmed residents ,_,  killing 30 of them and inflicting injuries on several others ,_,  before setting ablaze some residential houses ._. Also in Kaigamari ,_,  no fewer than eight people were said to have been killed yesterday when another set of gunmen attacked the village and set ablaze some houses and shops ._. 
An eyewitness ,_,  who was lucky to escape the attack in Ngoshe ,_,  Mallam Usman Jidda ,_,  told journalists in Maiduguri that the gunmen who were sighted some few days back in between the mountainous areas of Ngoshe and Limankara villages ,_,  had a field day without being confronted by security operatives in the area ._. I thank God for sparing my life and members of my family as we were able to escape the deadly attack ,_,  we are now settling with one of my relatives in Gwoza council area ._. 
I can confirm to you that more than 30 people were killed by the insurgents in Ngoshe ,_,  apart from the destruction of property worth millions of naira ,_,  Jidda stated ._. 
The attack in Kaigamari village of Konduga near the state capital ,_,  according to sources ,_,  had forced the surviving residents to flee the area to Maiduguri yesterday for safety ._. 
At Anchaka ,_,  the Chairman of Bama Local Government Area ,_,  Alhaji Baba Shehu ,_,  confirmed the killings of about 60 persons to journalists in Maiduguri ._. Shehu also lamented that several other persons were injured in the attacks ._. 
He disclosed that the attackers invaded the communities in the early morning of Saturday on motorbikes before embarking on mass destruction of property ._. He said :_:  The attackers invaded the communities early in the morning on motorbikes while residents were still sleeping ._. 
They set ablaze houses and shot residents who tried to escaped from the fire ._. 
About 60 persons were confirmed dead after the incident ,_,  with several others injured ._. 
Almost all the houses in the communities were destroyed by the hoodlums who threw IEDs at the buildings ._. 
Shehu said the attackers also destroyed the newly renovated motorised boreholes provided by the council for provision of potable water to the communities ._. He added that residents of the communities had fled to Maiduguri for fear of another attacks by the invaders ._. 
It is really a terrible situation ,_,  we had wanted to rush relief materials to the area to provide temporary succour to the victims ._. 
But we were prevailed upon by security agents to shelve our plans for security reasons ,_,  Shehu said ._. 
He appealed to the federal and the state government to assist the local government with resources towards rehabilitating the victims ._. 
About 60 persons were alleged to have been killed by suspected members of Boko Haram sect in Anchaka and neighbouring communities in Bama Local Government Area LGA of Borno ._.  ,_,  Alhaji Baba Shehu ,_,  the chairman of the council today disclosed to journalists in Maiduguri ._.

The All Progressives Congress APC yesterday asked the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC to assert its authority by sanctioning President Goodluck Jonathan and the Peoples Democratic Party PDP for breaching the Electoral Act ._. 
The party ,_,  in a statement by its interim National Publicity Secretary ,_,  Alhaji Lai Mohammed ,_,  chastised the president and his party for embarking on a campaign for the 2015 general election in violation of the electoral law ._. Jonathan has in recent months embarked on seemingly campaign tours of some geopolitical zones ,_,  during which he had excoriated the opposition party ,_,  albeit indirectly ,_,  in his speeches ._. 
So far ,_,  the president ,_,  out of the six geopolitical zones in the country ,_,  has taken his campaigns to the North -_: central ,_,  North -_: west ,_,  North -_: east and the latest port of call being the South -_: east which he visited on Friday with a pledge that the PDP would capture all states in the zone in 2015 ._. Jonathan's statement at the rally in Enugu ,_,  tagged 'Unity Rally' ,_,  has however earned him a rebuke from the APC leadership in the South -_: east zone which yesterday described him as someone desperate to get re -_: elected in 2015 by hook or crook ._. 
The APC further expressed disappointment that the president ,_,  who should be in the forefront of ensuring strict observance to the rule of law ,_,  has engaged in a serial violation of the electoral law ,_,  under the guise of liberation ,_,  family or unity rallies across the country ._. 
The party called on INEC to assert its independence ,_,  if it has any ,_,  by sanctioning the lawbreakers since no one is above the law ._. 
It said the president had exhibited a gross abuse of executive power by leading his party to prematurely campaign for the 2015 elections ,_,  in violation of the law ._. 
According to it ,_,  the action of Jonathan was a sign that the 2015 general election will be everything but free ,_,  fair and credible ._. 
APC warned that if INEC failed to act ,_,  it would loses any moral authority to stop other parties from also hitting the hustings ahead of time ._. APC said :_:  Hiding under nomenclature ,_,  this president has led his party to engage in brazen lawlessness and shameless impunity ._. 
They have gained an undue advantage over other parties ,_,  or beaten the gun ,_,  in athletics parlance ._. 
Therefore ,_,  they should suffer the consequences of their action ,_,  the least of which is a strong public rebuke ,_,  to be followed by stipulated sanctions if they persist ._. 
If nothing is done to check this lawlessness ,_,  Nigerians should brace up for more in the days ahead ._. 
What example is the president laying by violating the law What signal is he sending to Nigerians about the need to respect the laws of the land When a president brazenly violates the electoral law under the guise of some rally ,_,  has he not started election rigging Has he not already started compromising the electoral umpires and the security agencies The party added that everything showed that the president ,_,  by his serial violation ,_,  was sending a signal to Nigerians and the world that the coming elections would neither be free ,_,  fair nor credible ._. For instance ,_,  the party said when Jonathan boasted in Enugu on Friday that the PDP would capture the South -_: east in 2015 ,_,  he was engaging in electioneering ,_,  rather than a reunification campaign ._. 
It advised Jonathan to concentrate his energy on putting Nigerians back to work ,_,  ensuring the security of lives and property and stopping the massive looting of the commonwealth under his watch ._. 
APC said :_:  A president who cannot even commiserate with the families of innocent schoolchildren who were violently hacked down under his watch has no qualms about skirting around the scene of the dastardly act in the name of electioneering ._. 
Yet he has the temerity to point accusing fingers at others ._. 
What a cruel irony !_. Besides the national leadership of the opposition party ,_,  the president also came under attack yesterday from the South -_: east leadership of the APC ,_,  which accused him of engaging in do -_: or -_: die politics ahead of the 2015 general election ._. 
It said the president ,_,  by his utterances at the Enugu rally ,_,  showed signs of someone desperate to get re -_: elected in 2015 by hook or crook ._. 
The party ,_,  in a statement by its acting Zonal Publicity Secretary ,_,  Mr ._. 
Osita Okechukwu ,_,  added that Jonathan's verbal attack on APC in Enugu gave him out as a politician desperate to win a second term ._. The statement came as the opposition party successfully held its local government congresses in Enugu State without hitches ._. 
The congress produced Okechukwu ,_,  Chief Emma Eneukwu and Mrs Azuka Omenkeku as national delegates ._. 
The Awgu Local Government Area Congress also elected Mr ._. 
Rufus Nwagu as the chairman ._. 
Most of the local government congresses in the 17 councils of the state were conducted through consensus ._. 
The statement said Jonathan's speech at the Enugu rally was uncouth ,_,  unpresidential and showcases a desperate president in his quest for a second term ._. He urged the people of the zone not to support the second term bid of the president as directed by the governors of Abia ,_,  Enugu and Ebonyi States ._. 
How can a president throw caution to the winds ,_,  mount the rostrum only to cast aspersions on our great party ,_,  the APC It means he has not found time to read the manifesto of the APC ,_,  which has 'War Against Corruption' as the first cardinal programme ,_,  a war Jonathan detests ,_,  the party said ._. APC further said that penultimate week during the North -_: east zonal rally in Bauchi State ,_,  the president instead of narrating his efforts in combating the Boko Haram insurgency ,_,  resorted to shifting blame ,_,  and raining insults and invectives on the opposition ._. 
Okechukwu called on Ndigbo to distance themselves from the president ,_,  saying a vote for Jonathan in 2015 would be a wasted vote because even the Niger Deltans are disappointed with his poor performance since he failed in four years to complete the East -_: West Road which cuts across the length and breadth of the Niger Delta ._. Will it not be foolhardy to expect anything good from the same president with the same inchoate ,_,  nebulous and anti -_: people economic policy ,_,  bedevilled by pervasive and monumental corruption For you cannot vote the same president with the same inept and clueless leadership qualities and expect different results ,_,  he added ._. 
Meanwhile ,_,  the governorship candidate of the Labour Party LP in Ekiti State ,_,  Hon ._. 
Opeyemi Bamidele ,_,  has called for sanctions against any party or individual that contravenes the electoral law and the principle of issue -_: based campaigns ahead of the June 21 governorship election in the state ._. Bamidele urged INEC Chairman ,_,  Prof Attahiru Jega ,_,  to take punitive steps against parties found to be unruly to douse the raging tension in the polity ._. 
Bamidele ,_,  in a statement issued yesterday by his media aide ,_,  Mr ._. 
Ahmed Salami ,_,  said INEC as the regulatory body on election process should not wait until the people are being killed by desperate politicians before punishing violators of the electoral law ._. 
Security agencies have been tasked to probe the activities of Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State over an alleged call to violence ._. The Peoples Democratic Party PDP standard bearer in the state ,_,  Mr ._. 
Iyiola Omisore ,_,  in a statement signed by his Director of Media and Strategy ,_,  Mr ._. 
Diran Odeyemi ,_,  yesterday alleged that the governor in a live television programme on the state Broadcasting Service aired on Saturday made an open call to arm ._. Describing it as a clear threats to the peaceful conduct of the August election ._. 
Omisore said :_:  We condemn in the strongest possible terms the call to violence by Aregbesola ._. This open call to arm is the final stage of the governor and his party's desperation in view of their imminent defeat in August ._. We are not unaware of the evil plot of the governor to illegally purchase police uniforms for the many militant groups he has been training ahead of the election ._. We are aware of the Boko Haram elements the governor has been nursing for the past two years as well as several thugs he is training in several locations in Lagos State ._. 
We urgently call on the security agencies to probe the governor and call him to order as a matter of urgency ._. The opposition party in the state said Aregbesola declared about a week ago that there will be blood flowing in the state if the PDP wins the forthcoming election in the state ._. He said :_:  We take these utterances by a man who is supposed to be the Chief Security Officer of the state to be a manifestation of gross irresponsibility ,_,  a direct threat to peace in the state and a reflection of defeatist attitude by the All Progressives congress APC even before the actual election ._. The party claimed that by such conduct ,_,  the governor is constituting himself as a security risk by directly threatening the peace of the state and that the APC by extension is conceding that the mass of our people had indeed rejected its retrogressive rule and are ready to vote it out come August 9 ._. 
Barely 48 hours after suspected Boko Haram terrorists massacred more than 200 persons including students who were writing their Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination ,_,  UTME ,_,  in Borno ,_,  the insurgents ,_,  yesterday ,_,  continued their killing spree as they killed no fewer than 60 persons in Ngoshe and Kaigamari villages of Borno close to the border with Cameroon ._. The terrorists also set ablaze many houses ,_,  shops ,_,  telecommunication masts and other property worth millions of naira ._. 
This came as the troops deployed to the North Central zone of the country to checkmate herdsmen/ farmers� clashes as well as cattle rustling that has claimed hundreds of lives have recovered a cache of arms from militia men in Kaduna and Plateau states ._. Speaking with AFP in Maiduguri ,_,  the state capital ,_,  the chairman of Bama Local Government Area ,_,  Mallam Baba Shehu Gulumba ,_,  said :_:  �The attackers ,_,  who were no doubt Boko Haram insurgents ,_,  attacked Amchaka and nearby villages this morning ,_,  hurling IEDs Improvised Explosive Devices into homes and setting them on fire ._. 
They then went on a shooting spree ,_,  opening fire on confused residents as they tried to flee ,_,  killing 60 people and injuring several others� ._. An eye witness who escaped the attack in Ngoshe ,_,  Mallam Usman Jidda told Vanguard that the gunmen who were sighted some few days back in between the mountainous areas of Ngoshe and Limankara villages carried out the attack without any challenge from the security operatives in the area ._. �I thank God for sparing my life and members of my family as we were able to escape the deadly attack ._. 
We are now settling with one of my relatives in Gwoza council area ._. 
I can confirm to you that more than 30 people were killed by the insurgents in Ngoshe ,_,  apart from the destruction of property worth millions of naira� ,_,  Jidda stated ._. The attack in Kaigamari village of Konduga near the state capital according to sources have forced surviving residents to flee the area to Maiduguri on Sunday for safety ._. All effort to reach the Divisional Police Officers of Gwoza and Konduga to confirm the separate incidents proved abortive as there was no GSM network service in the two council areas ._. The insurgents had on Friday laid ambush for the students who were on their way to Biu from Maiduguri in eight vehicles to write their exams ._. The senator representing Borno Central ,_,  Zannah Ahmed told newsmen that at least 210 people were killed in attacks that lasted from Thursday till Friday morning ._. 
He said the attackers stormed the communities in two armoured personnel cars and seven double cabin pick ups and descended on a Teachers� College in Dikwa ,_,  killing seven people before burning down the school library and administrative block ._. 
This account has ,_,  however been refuted by some authorities in Borno ,_,  who claimed that no student was killed in the attacks ._. Military recover arms in Kaduna ,_,  PlateauAside the arms recovered in Kaduna and Plateau states ,_,  a huge number of stolen cows and sheep believed to have been rustled were also recovered from the armed gangs ._. The arms included six rifles ,_,  25 dane guns ,_,  four revolvers and 10 locally fabricated pistols while over 90 cows and 45 sheep that were rustled were also recovered ._. 
Another 50 cows have also been recovered from rustlers who attacked herdsmen in another location ._. Making the disclosure in a statement ,_,  Director of Defence Information ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade said :_:  �The military assault on camps of armed militia men in Kaduna and Plateau states has led to the recovery of arms and some stolen livestock ._. �The operations in Dahia Luka ,_,  Makera and some communities in Plateau and Kaduna states ,_,  resulted in the arrest of three wounded armed men after the encounter in which some of them died ._. �Over 90 cows and 45 sheep believed to have been rustled were also recovered in addition to weapons ._. 
Another 50 cows have also been recovered from rustlers who attacked herdsmen in another location ._. �The recovered cows have been handed over to the traditional rulers in the area while the arrested armed men are still being interrogated ._.

Christian youths with machetes cleanse the land of Muslims ._.

A handful of remaining Muslims have become trapped ,_,  and are sheltered in enclaves guarded by international peacekeepers ._. The roles are reversed in the Central African Republic  -_:  the country is in even greater chaos than it was a few months ago ._. 
The terror of one group has been replaced by that of the other ._. The CAR has been liberated from the marauding warriors of S�l�ka ,_,  a loose coalition of rebel gangs from the Muslim populated North East ._. S�l�ka held sway in the capital Bangui since March last year ._. 
They were expelled in December by thousands of youths armed with machetes ,_,  spears and shotguns from the Christian militias of the 'Anti Balaka' ,_,  a loose alliance of self -_: defence groups in rural areas ._. Until recently ,_,  the Muslim population was about 15 per cent of the five million Central Africans ._.

All the buildings had been destroyed with the exception of the mosque ._.

Now the Christian inhabitants have returned ,_,  but their three small churches ,_,  the school ,_,  the clinic ,_,  and all the houses are blackened ._.

They are all ready to leave for the north of the country as soon as they are provided an escort by the foreign peacekeepers ._. 
They want to go near the border with Chad ,_,  in order to join the tens of thousands of Muslim IDPs who are already camped in the border area ._. Muslims were mainly active in trade and transport ._. 
Their important role in the economy created envy among the Christians ._. 
Their biggest problem now is that in perspective on the country's Christians ,_,  Muslims and S�l�ka mean the same thing ._. Although religious leaders have called for reconciliation ,_,  the poisonous hate took religious dimensions ._. 
Yeah ,_,  maybe we associated ourselves too much with S�l�ka admits Imam Ismail Nafi carefully ._.

Cameroon's minister of communication and government spokesperson ,_,  Issa Tciroma Bakari ,_,  said that by seizing the arms ,_,  Cameroon had proved to the world that it is cooperating with Nigeria to stop Boko Haram threats ._.

The government said the arms were seized in the sub -_: division of Gulfe ,_,  in the Far North Cameroon region ._. Competing reportsForty -_: year -_: old businessman Ibrahima Dewa told VOA they had not seen any weapons in their village ._.

I will make no statement ,_,  said Bakari ._. He described claims ,_,  however ,_,  that the arms did not exist as defamatory ._.

Growing issueLast month Nigeria asked its neighbors in the Lake Chad Basin Commission to create a task force to handle terrorists ,_,  but Cameroon said it would only contribute troops when there is need ._.

Soyinka ,_,  who was a keynote speaker at a colloquium with the theme Fundamental Imperatives of Cohabitation ,_,  Faith and Secularism ,_,  organised by Centre for Black Culture and International Understanding ,_,  CBCIU ,_,  Osogbo ,_,  called for a frank talk among stakeholders in the affairs of the country to end the spate of bombings ._. According to Soyinka ,_,  who said he received with shock the news of Nyanya Motor Park bombing ,_,  authorities concerned must arrest the situation ._. Debunking a newspaper report ,_,  which quoted him as saying the nation's security challenges could be resolved through prayers ,_,  Soyinka posited that Boko Haram insurgency should not be mistaken for a religious war ,_,  insisting that prayers alone could not end the crises ._. He said :_:  I have never said prayer can help resolve the security challenges facing Nigeria ._. I believe the situation must be tackled without partisanship and all these uninformed comments cannot help the situation ._. We should wake up to the reality ._. 
Nigeria is in war and only competence can solve the problem ,_,  not prayers ._. At the event ,_,  Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State said the only way to respect God was by showing respect to human beings ,_,  emphasising the need for people to accommodate others' religions ._. 
The Sultan of Sokoto Alhaji Sa'ad Abubakar ,_,  on Sunday said there were no plans to turn Nigeria into an Islamic nation ._. Abubakar ,_,  who is also the President -_: General ,_,  Jamatu Nasril Islam JNI ,_,  made this known at the Golden Jubilee lecture of the JNI in Kaduna ._. Nobody can Islamise Nigeria ,_,  if Allah wanted he would have made everybody Muslims ,_,  so also with Christianity ._. 
God would have made everybody Christian if He wanted ._. He stressed the need for the people to set aside ethno -_: religious differences and be committed toward peace and development of the nation ._. The Sultan said JNI criticism of certain policies of the present government was a wakeup call for government or those in leadership positions to do what is right ._. He said that JNI's action was not aimed at fighting the government or any group or religion ._. Abubakar ,_,  however ,_,  decried the insecurity that had pervaded many parts of the nation ,_,  especially the North -_: East by the Boko Haram insurgents ._. He said that the activities of the insurgents should not be seen as an attempt by Muslims to prosecute Christians or turn Nigeria into an Islamic country ._. Abubakar ,_,  therefore ,_,  appealed to Christians and other faithful to join hands with Muslims to tackle the present security challenges and other problems facing the country ._.

Mukhtar Yero of Kaduna State urged JNI to play its role in defusing tension based on interpretations of Allah's revelations ._. This ,_,  Yero said ,_,  the Islamic organisation could do by encouraging Islamic scholars and preachers to dwell more on the five pillars of Islam ._. Yero said that the five pillars remained the core of the Islam and its unifying factors ._. He also stressed the need for the body to collaborate with other inter -_: faith dialogue organisations toward promoting peace and unity in the nation ._. The objective of such interaction is to devise means of promoting peaceful coexistence for the development of our great country ._. We all know that without peace and stability there can be no meaningful development because our country will economically stagnate ,_,  while majority of the people ,_,  irrespective of faith ,_,  wallow in abject poverty ._. It is ,_,  therefore ,_,  a collective responsibility ,_,  especially on the part of the JNI and similar bodies in the country ,_,  to galvanise the people toward achieving lasting peace and security ,_,  he said ._. The Speaker House of Representatives ,_,  Aminu Tambuwal ,_,  governors ,_,  traditional leaders ,_,  and Islamic scholars attended the occasion ._. NAN
Professor Pat Utomi is an economist and a politician ._. 
He co -_: founded the Lagos Business School ,_,  now Pan African University ._. 
In this interview ,_,  Utomi speaks on the on -_: going National Conference and the economy among other issues ._. One of the biggest issues in the country today is the National Conference ._. 
We have optimists concerning the conference ._. 
We also have pessimists ._. 
There are those who are neither here nor there ._. 
Where do you standI have made it part of business to keep challenging us about what our consciousness should be ._. 
In recent times ,_,  we have begun to focus on two sets of activities to deal with this matter ._. 
The first has to do with the hope that was raised that a national dialogue could result in a certain understanding of what has kept us back and how we could look at the future so that we could make the progress that is deservedly ours given the endowment of our country ._. In that regard ,_,  I was the convener of the National Summit Group which began the formal canvassing for National Conference ._. 
But I am deeply sad at what came to be known as the National Conference ._. 
It's a tragedy for Nigeria that we ended up with how the body was constituted ._. It is incapable of engaging the future; it is talk on the past and the personal quarrels of yesterday ._. 
It lacks the capacity ,_,  in terms of many of the people who are there and in terms of their endowment not because they are good or bad people ,_,  to engage the future ._. 
And so ,_,  many people are now dismissing the conference as a waste of good time ,_,  good money and all kinds of motives are now being imputed on how it was constituted ,_,  why it was constituted ,_,  and all of that ._. That's far from what we had in mind ,_,  I think there's an obsession ,_,  given the place many of the members are coming from ,_,  with perhaps issues of structure and power completely oriented by several decades of primordial politics ,_,  the politics of sharing ._. 
So how do we share better ,_,  how do we share more effectivelyWhereas I think the biggest things that challenge Nigeria today are the issues of national character ,_,  rethinking the vision of ourselves ,_,  our values and indignity ,_,  corruption ._. 
Structure matters but ,_,  in the opinion of some of us ,_,  it comes a very distant place compared to some of the things that hold Nigeria down and we are going to end up with this obsession of sharing power and all of that with a dead document ._. Interestingly ,_,  in the last two weeks ,_,  I have received calls from people who try to hold some of us accountable for pushing for this conference ._. 
And we are actually in deep consultations with professional bodies ,_,  even with some ethnic nationality groups ,_,  especially with the youth groups because young people were significantly marginalized in the process of constituting a group to look at the future ._. 
And these are very smart young people ._. 
People think when you say youth groups; you're talking about 'area boys' ,_,  that's not what youth groups are ._. 
Indeed if there's anything anybody understands about this economy ,_,  the new growth in this economy is significantly driven by those who are about 30 years old without us being aware of it ._. In other words ,_,  nothing good is likely to come out of the conference ._. When you exclude that kind of people from discussing the future; then you don't understand the future that is coming ._. 
And this is what this conference has fundamentally done and so we are in consultation with all these groups ._. 
There just might be an alternative National Conference that can engage the problems of Nigeria ._. I have always thought of Delta as the new UAE where ,_,  literally ,_,  you can create a Dubai ,_,  an Abu Dhabi and all of that ._. 
Yet it remains ravished with poverty in the midst of so much ._. 
Of course ,_,  there have been talks on 'Delta Beyond Oil' ,_,  that oil can bring savings that can help to advance other sectors the way Dubai is ._. I am particularity pained because I have been a part of a process of looking at Delta's prospects ._. Former Governor James Ibori constituted a think -_: tank on Delta State development chaired by Deacon Gamaliel Onosode ._. 
I was a part of that think -_: tank; we marked Delta State ._. 
For those who might have followed my writings on matters of political economy ,_,  factor endowment ,_,  driven value change into global market ,_,  those are the basics to grow Nigeria ._. 
That is ,_,  mark the endowment of Nigeria at the national level ._. 
And this has been well marked in all the works of the Delta think -_: tank on Vision 2025 ._. But I don't see change principally being developed to create the opportunity for growth ._. 
And so we talk so much ,_,  whether in the civil society or in government ,_,  but the problem is how do we walk our talks; what can we do to begin to translate our public or private resources ,_,  because there are so many things you can do even with private resources Let us look at the example of the Second Niger Bridge ._. Any time somebody wants to run for election ,_,  he will promise to build the bridge ._. 
But what is the big deal about a bridge across the Niger Governor Fashola of Lagos State built one from Ikoyi to Lekki that is not shorter than the Niger Bridge ._. 
We can have three new bridges across the Niger built by the private sector and they will be profitable ._. 
I frequently cross from Onitsha to Asaba which is now a nightmare ,_,  there are people who live in Asaba and are actually working in Onitsha ._. 
So it is like crossing a creek bridge from Onitsha to Asaba with only one bridge ._. 
And yet we play football with something which simple creative application of the mind can solve ._. I can guarantee anybody who wants to try me that three Niger bridges are easy to formulate and execute ._. Look at the Australian bank which has become the greatest financier of infrastructure in the world ,_,  how they built that expertise; we have the money; the will and all we need to do to show we are serious ,_,  trust worthy and will follow laws ._. 
This is why a National Conference is not just about how many states and federating units do we have or whether we adopt a British type Westminster parliamentary model or the presidential system; it is national character that can make it easy for an Australian bank to think of coming to build a bridge across the Niger knowing that it will not have the problem of a governor coming it two years' time to say 'I cancel the deal' which is what happens routinely in our country ._. What kind of conference would you have loved to seeThe conference should be building national consensus ,_,  talking about acceptable norms ._. 
To return to Delta ,_,  a couple of weeks ago I talked about this movement for a new Delta; I said that one of the easiest ways to characterize a new Delta is a programme that I called 'Aregbe Times 20' ._. 
What does 'Aregbe Times 20' mean There was a lot of talk on how many pupils/students were in school in Osun State because they get free lunch ._. 
You can give breakfast and lunch in a state like Delta and not encounter any challenge finding the resources to execute it ._. 
If any progress must take place ,_,  there are two things government must do :_:  education and healthcare ._. 
People who are well and educated will create their future ._. 
And so when you look at what Governor Aregbesola is doing ,_,  you will see it translate ,_,  in few years ,_,  into a different kind of Osun State ._. 
It is not by accident that today we keep talking about the advantage that the South -_: west has because of Chief Awolowo's policy on education in the 50s ._. I don't want to talk about how much I have tried to push these issues privately with people who have been in the leadership in Delta State over the couples of years ,_,  that it is not a big deal; you stimulate the agricultural economy of the state by simply collaborating with farmers who will provide the food that will feed the children to attract more children to school; and then ensure that you give them the best possible education and training and retraining for teachers by using remote teaching possibilities that technology made possible to ensure that the best education get to kids across the state ._. 
You can also create this competitive economy where you can create a new city not far from Bomadi that will grow not like Abuja; if I have my may ,_,  I will bomb Abuja out of existence because it is a major part of Nigeria's problem ._. That point I am making is that ,_,  nearly 39 per cent of the federal revenue goes to Abuja ._. 
North -_: east takes1 ._. 6 per cent of the revenue and you are talking about Boko Haram ,_,  why will it not happen South -_: east of Nigeria 2 point something per cent; so why won't you have kidnapping in thereA federal administrative capital does not grow the way Abuja has grown ._. 
It is because of the huge channeling of resources into Abuja for the comfort of the administrative elite that you are creating exactly those conditions that Robert Capland talked about in his anticipation of the West Africa of the future ._. But if ,_,  organically ,_,  you take somewhere around Bomadi and create a base on its factor endowment ,_,  the hydro carbon value chain that goes into the global economy; go to another part of Delta like Koko and take an agro allied endowment ,_,  say rubber ._. 
You create an industry for it through which you generate employment and you take the resources available there into the global economy ,_,  invest in all the skills of people getting practical skills through vocational skill and all of that by working within that industrial park ._. 
You go to somewhere around Iseluku ,_,  create another city that is also based on factor endowment on agriculture into global value chain ,_,  you will find Abu Dhabi and Dubai emerge organically ._. Any serious minded person can create a full employment economy in a state like Delta ._. 
The whole essence of the Bretton Wood institutions after World War Two was to attain a full employment status for the global economy ._. Our failureLeaders of the free world got together and said ,_,  'Let us create institutions that will ensure that we are not exporting problems from one economy into another and not exporting inflation and that trade continues to flow' ._. 
The thinking gave birth to the IMF ,_,  the World Bank and of course their subsidiaries ._. And so the idea of a full economy is not a utopian idea ._. 
Delta State has the endowment to ensure that everybody ,_,  over 21 ,_,  who has no job is immediately put to work ,_,  paid some stipend and ,_,  where he or she has no re skill ,_,  be programmed and deskilled within a short period of time and then you can create an economy that can become a driver for the growth of the rest of Nigerians ._. Our failure as a people is to say why can't we get our society to do this that is possible It is something that all of us will be judged one day ._. 
And this is the trouble that I have put myself to in the last two years at different levels ._. 
And ,_,  sometimes ,_,  some people think I am crazy ,_,  but I am looking at how I will be judged ._. My hope is that this movement for a new Delta State will bring in people from all sides of the divide ,_,  political ,_,  ethnic and wherever ,_,  because the strength of Delta is in its diversity ._. 
And that through this movement ,_,  we can put a game plan in place that is clear ._. 
I have an inclination that is left of the political center ._. 
In terms of political affiliation ,_,  I am a member of APC and I say it very clearly that I am a part of the making of the APC manifesto which is people -_: centered ,_,  and the ideal is that if you take that kind of people -_: centered approach ,_,  you will renew this country and the coming anarchy may be averted ._. 
But not to have that kind of leadership orientation ,_,  we will thoroughly experience the anarchy that Capland said is coming to Africa ._. After Capland finished his analysis ,_,  he said that a point where there is a significant convergence of this malfunction and cleavages is a city in Nigeria call Jos ._. 
My friend ,_,  who was a security chief at a time ,_,  when I gave him the book to read ,_,  finished reading on a certain Saturday morning ,_,  called and said ,_,  I want to find this man called Robert Capland ._. 
Of course Capland is not a magician ,_,  he is not a prophet; he is just an intelligent person who inclined himself with a particular trend he saw in a part of the world the way he did and predicted what we are now experiencing ._. 
I am sad that many Nigerians have not come into the light that we are in a major war ._. More people die in Nigeria everyday than in Syria ,_,  than those that die in major civil wars of the world and we talk about war in Syria but think we just have a small problem in Nigeria; what we have in Nigeria is not a small problem because Nigeria is at war ,_,  a major war ._. 
And if we don't rise to intervene on the side of the poor ,_,  it will consume us all ._. The economy is still down despite the efforts of government to revive it ._. 
How do we get it rightProperty right constitutes a major part of the constitutional arrangement that makes an economy advance ._. 
Now ,_,  until the people have a philosophical understanding of what property right means ,_,  that country is going to work very hard to make major progress ._. For a long time ,_,  I was in a position to be called and I still get called by people who want to invest in Nigeria ._. 
Before IBM decided to re -_: enter Nigeria ,_,  I spent time with their executives around the world ._. 
As the discussion went on ,_,  on whether they will be coming to Nigeria with any significant strength ,_,  I was contacted from London ,_,  Washington and all of the calls I received were laced with skepticism about the system and I kept on persuading them on why they couldn't afford not to be in Nigeria ._. ScaredPeople are scared about Nigeria because there is impunity ,_,  and property rights are not certain ._. 
Later IBM decided to come into Nigeria ,_,  and also GE ._. 
So many came to me and said if they have any trade dispute in court ,_,  they will never get a resolution ._. 
On the basis of this ,_,  their thinking is ,_,  'I would rather go to a place where the challenges of doing business are lower and there is a higher certainty' ._. 
Because of this ,_,  I wrote a book in 1988 ,_,  entitled :_:  'Managing uncertainty; competition and strategy in emerging economies' ._. 
Because of the issues of institutions and economic performance ,_,  properties rights are so fundamental and that is why people don't understand when some of us raise some fundamental issues ._. InfringementFor instance ,_,  when this banking thing came ,_,  it was a grievous infringement on people's property rights ._. 
And what did the media do They were cheering ,_,  saying catch those thieves but Vanguard was exceptional because it was the paper that projected the plan and that it was a conspiracy to do what was done in the banking industry ._. This famous reform has set Nigeria back by 20 years ,_,  I assure you ._. 
Peoples' banks were stolen to their face ._. 
But we celebrated the deception and created one more reason people should not invest in Nigeria because property rights are violated ._. 
A Peruvian economist wrote this book on the mystery of capital and the essence of his thesis is that the problem between the rich and the poor is that the poor has assets but it is dead capital ,_,  not fundable and not translatable into capital ._. 
Socio -_: Economic Rights and Accountability Project SERAP has said that the unlawful and unnecessary killings of many Nigerians today at the Nyanya Motor Park ,_,  Abuja show that the measures the government is taking to tackle the Boko Haram phenomenon are inadequate and simply not working ._. The organization urged President Goodluck Jonathan to show leadership and urgently initiate fundamental changes in the security strategy to end continuing civilian casualties ,_,  and a climate of insecurity across the country ._. In the statement signed by SERAP executive director Adetokunbo Mumuni the group said that ,_,  Nigerians have heard promises from this government before that it would take all possible steps to prevent bombing tragedies and citizens' deaths and injuries ._. 
But if this government is to be taken seriously on its promises to protect the citizens ,_,  this latest explosion needs to be the last of its kind ._. 
The government must now come up with a blueprint to end continuing bombing tragedies ._. As a first step ,_,  the government must swiftly ,_,  transparently and thoroughly investigate the killings ,_,  make the findings public and bring anyone suspected to be involved to justice ._. 
Nigerians are reeling from so much loss ,_,  and this government should do everything possible to ensure that disasters like Nyanya Motor Park are not repeated ,_,  the organization said ._. 
The Assistant Inspector -_: General of Police in charge of Zone 2 ,_,  Mamman Tsafe ,_,  weekend ,_,  claimed that the refusal of governors to provide required support for security agencies ,_,  was responsible for the continued mayhem by the Boko Haram insurgents in parts of the country ._. The AIG spoke in Abeokuta ,_,  Ogun State ,_,  during the inauguration of an ultra -_: modern secretariat built by the Police Officers' Wives Association ,_,  POWA ,_,  Ogun State Command ._.

Toyin Akano ,_,  however ,_,  implored Nigerians to improve their level of security consciousness to curb violent crimes in the country ._. He urged state governors to place premium on providing logistics support for the Nigeria Police to combat security challenges in the country and commended Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State and his Lagos State counterpart ,_,  Babatunde Fashola ,_,  for providing patrol vehicles and other logistics to enhance effective policing in both states ._. He said :_:  I call on other governors to give the police the required support so that they can have the peace we are having in these states ._. 
In fact ,_,  if all governors are committed ,_,  all these insurgent situations will be taken care of ._. 
I commend their level of security consciousness but they only need to improve on it and that would make their abodes safer ._. Commenting on the recent killing of seven persons by a policeman in Abeokuta ,_,  the AIG said the killer -_: cop might be suffering from psychiatric imbalance ._. He said :_:  I am not ruling out the psychiatric situation ._. 
It is very unfortunate ,_,  the man is dead ,_,  we cannot get evidence from him ,_,  but ,_,  investigation is still going on ._. 
We cannot rule out some other explanations that may likely come up ._. 
You can imagine killing others and then at the end you decide to kill yourself ._. 
Investigation will unfold what really happened ,_,  but ,_,  I am not ruling out psychiatric imbalance ._. 
WITH teary eyes ,_,  delegates ,_,  yesterday ,_,  condemned in strong terms ,_,  bomb explosions at Nyanya bus terminal in Abuja ,_,  the nation's capital ,_,  by members of the Boko Haram sect in which about 100 people were feared dead and several others injured ._.

General Geoffrey Ejiga ._. The motion read in part :_:  The conference condemns the activities of the perpetrators of these heinous crimes ._. 
The Conference is concerned about the continuous deterioration of the security situation and calls upon the Federal Government to take urgently ,_,  drastic and concrete steps to arrest and immediately bring an end to these atrocities ._. They urged that all necessary measures be put in place to use proportional and non -_:  excessive force to deal with the situation and safeguard the life ,_,  property and well -_:  being of innocent civilian population in all areas affected ._. 
Leading a robust debate on the motion ,_,  Modibbo Kawu lamented that despite the declaration of state of emergency in three North East states of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe ,_,  the insecurity in those states has continued to escalate ._. He said :_:  Whereas the Rules of Procedure has provided in Order V11 Rule 1 that matters of urgent public importance if any may be tabled for discussion; whereas the security situation in the country has been deteriorating in the last 5 -_: 6 years; whereas the preponderance of the security breaches have been in the Northalthough security is a National issue; whereas in the last two months the security breaches have escalated in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa stares where over 20 villages have been completely razed down and thousands of people killed including school children in spite of the state of emergency which has been in existence for almost one year;Whereas in the North East the problem is Boko Haram ,_,  in the North West ,_,  it is armed banditry ,_,  cattle rustling and kidnapping of young women more particularly in Zamfara ,_,  Jigawa ,_,  Katsina and Kaduna states ._. Whereas in the North Central we have ethno -_:  religious and herdsmen and farmers conflicts ,_,  which have led tothe sacking of several villages ,_,  destruction of property ,_,  displacement of people and killing of thousands of people in Benue ,_,  Plateau and Nasarawa states; whereas the Conference notes that Nigerian security forces have made a lot of efforts to bring the insurgency ,_,  armed conflict and banditry under control; in spite of the efforts of the security forces the situation has continued to escalate ._. Nwanyanwu ,_,  Ozekhome's motionPrior to Kawu's motion ,_,  National Chairman of the Labour Party ,_,  LP ,_,  Dan Nwanyanwu who is representing LP at the conference  ,_, had moved a motion condemning the killings ._. 
The motion was seconded by a Federal Government delegate ,_,  Chief Mike Ozekhome SAN ,_,  who argued that the wave of killings in the country is increasing in wavelength ._. According to him ,_,  the killings have become endless as perpetrators of such acts no longer discriminate between Christians and Moslems or northerners and southerners in their crusade and called on the House to urge the authorities to re -_: strategise and come up with effective measures to address the problem of insecurity in the country ._. Coomassie intervenesHowever ,_,  former Inspector General of Police ,_,  IGP ,_,  Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie ,_,  representing the North West geo -_:  political zone punctured the motion ,_,  saying that the North was ready with a prepared motion to be read on the insecurity situation in the North and sought the permission of Conference Chairman ,_,  Justice Idris Kutigi and the sponsor ,_,  Kawu ,_,  was then called to move it ._. Attempts to scuttle motionSpeaking on the motion ,_,  Chief Sergeant Awuse ,_,  a South -_: South delegate almost scuttled the motion raising Order 8 arguing that the conference cannot entertain such motion because delegates were not served with the motion paper ahead of time ,_,  adding ,_,  If a motion paper has been served on those at the table ,_,  delegates deserve to be served copies ._. While I sympathise with what is happening in the country ,_,  we must not add to the problem ,_,  but we must go by the rules and we should not create any problem for ourselves ._. However ,_,  Femi Falana SAN ,_,  representing the Civil Society Organisation ,_,  cited Order 1 rule 2 and countered Awuse's point of order ,_,  saying no formality was required on this issue because what happened yesterday where people were killed was an emergency situation and an issue of urgent National importance ._. 
He noted that the Galtimari's report had covered these issues and urged the government to implement the report and those of similar panels ._. These killers are not Nigerians  -_:  AbdullahiCommenting ,_,  Amb ._. 
Yerima Abdullahi representing the Elder Statesmen category said :_:  We have been scratching the surface of this issue of Boko Haram ._. 
Some of these undertakers are not Nigerians ._. 
It may have started with Nigerians but these people are not Nigerians ._. 
Security may have better information ._. 
They have roots in Cameroon ,_,  Niger ,_,  Chad ,_,  etc ._.  We have a very big problem ._. 
Security forces should show more interest ._. 
The earlier the authorities woke up to this situation ,_,  the better ._. Nigeria is under siege  -_:  ClarkContributing to the motion ,_,  a former Federal Commissioner for Information and Ijaw leader ,_,  and a delegate on the platform of Elder Statesmen ,_,  Chief Edwin Clark ,_,  noted that what was happening at the moment with people being killed was not a matter of the North or South but requires a collective action because Nigeria was under siege ._. His words :_:  The issue of my son that was kidnapped is no longer an issue compared to what has happened ._. 
What is happening now is a national issue ._. 
It is not a North or South issue ._. 
Wherever it is happening ,_,  Nigerians are being killed and Nigerians are under siege ._. We have a duty to look at this issue and not to play politics with it ._. 
Security is doing its job ._. 
They need the support of every one of us; soldiers alone cannot fight this war ._. 
I think it has come to a stage where all must be involved ._. 
When my son was kidnapped ,_,  all of you rallied together ._. 
He is not dead ._. 
Everyday we sit down here deliberating ._. 
What are we debating about Will Nigeria be eradicated before we know it is here with usThis conference must do something about it ._. 
This conference must send a message to the authorities that something must be strongly done about it ._. 
Instead of me going to eat at 2 pm ,_,  monetise it and send it to those who are dying fighting this scourge ._. 
The time has come for all of us to do something ._. We need holistic approach  -_: AnkaOn his part ,_,  a delegate representing the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria ,_,  TUC ,_,  Hassan Salihu Anka ,_,  who condemned the act ,_,  however ,_,  called for a holistic approach involving all stakeholders to solve the problem ._. 
Abuja National leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP has alleged that the leadership of the opposition ,_,  All Progressives Congress ,_,  APC and their governors were responsible for Monday's bomb explosion by the members of the Boko Haram which took place in Nyanya ,_,  a suburb of the nation's capital ,_,  Abuja ,_,  where over hundred persons were feared dead ,_,  with several others ,_,  injured ._. Noting that the attacks cannot be justified under any guise ,_,  the PDP raised alarm that they were politically motivated and can be traced to the utterances and comments of those it termed ,_,  desperate persons who seek to undermine and discredit the present administration and make the nation ungovernable for President Goodluck Jonathan by instituting a reign of terror against the people ._. In a statement Monday by PDP National Publicity Secretary ,_,  Chief Olisa Metuh ,_,  the party while condemning the act as barbaric ,_,  monstrous and extremely wicked ,_,  stressed that the party was shocked and has remained grief -_:  stricken since it received the news of the gruesome attack and killing of Nigerians pursuing their legitimate endeavours ._. Alleging that the APC should be held responsible over the sad and unfortunate incident ,_,  Metuh said ,_,  We stand by our earlier statements that these attacks on our people are politically motivated by unpatriotic persons ,_,  especially those in the APC ,_,  who have been making utterances and comments ,_,  promoting violence and blood -_: letting as a means of achieving political control ._. Nigerians are also aware of utterances by certain APC governors which have been aimed at undermining our security forces and emboldening insurgents against the people ._. Those who have been promoting violence through their utterances can now see the monster they have created ._. 
They can now see the end product of their comments; a country flowing daily with the blood of the innocent ._. The question is; how do they feel when they see the mangled and blood -_: soaked bodies of their victims How do they feel when they hear the voices of the dying and the injuredOf course they feel nothing ._. 
Their hearts have been hardened and they are embittered by the fact that they have been rejected by the people ._. They are bitter because the people have chosen to rally round the government they love and voted for; but must they chose the path of violence and bloodletting as a response to the wishes and aspiration of the peopleThe PDP weeps ._. 
We are indeed grief -_: stricken ._. 
Our hearts go out to the bereaved ,_,  especially those who have been orphaned and widowed and those now deprived of their bread winners by this evil act ._. 
We share in their pain ,_,  their anguish and their loss and pray that those behind their grief must not escape justice ._. Urging all well meaning Nigerians to stand up and join President Goodluck Jonathan in his untiring efforts to check terrorism in the country ,_,  the PDP caution those fueling the attacks to retrace their steps ,_,  rid themselves of bitterness and desperation and seek forgiveness from God ._. The party ,_,  in solidarity with the people also shelved all official engagements while praying God to grant the bereaved the fortitude to bear the loss ._. 
President Goodluck Monday assured the nation that the Boko Haram threat was just a temporary set back ,_,  promising that the Country would triumph over the terrorists ._. President Jonathan who visited the scene of the deadly blast in Abuja where over 71 people died emphasised that there was need for the citizens to be enlightened to be security conscious and report suspicious persons and object to security agencies ._.

An eye witness who escaped the attack in Ngoshe ,_,  Mallam Usman Jidda told Vanguard that the gunmen who were sighted some few days back in between the mountainous areas of Ngoshe and Limankara villages carried out the attack without any challenge from the security operatives in the area ._. I thank God for sparing my life and members of my family as we were able to escape the deadly attack ._. 
We are now settling with one of my relatives in Gwoza council area ._. 
I can confirm to you that more than 30 people were killed by the insurgents in Ngoshe ,_,  apart from the destruction of property worth millions of naira ,_,  Jidda stated ._. The attack in Kaigamari village of Konduga near the state capital according to sources have forced surviving residents to flee the area to Maiduguri on Sunday for safety ._. All effort to reach the Divisional Police Officers of Gwoza and Konduga to confirm the separate incidents proved abortive as there was no GSM network service in the two council areas ._. The insurgents had on Friday laid ambush for the students who were on their way to Biu from Maiduguri in eight vehicles to write their exams ._. The senator representing Borno Central ,_,  Zannah Ahmed told newsmen that at least 210 people were killed in attacks that lasted from Thursday till Friday morning ._. 
He said the attackers stormed the communities in two armoured personnel cars and seven double cabin pick ups and descended on a Teachers' College in Dikwa ,_,  killing seven people before burning down the school library and administrative block ._.

Soyinka noted that Boko Haram insurgency should not be mistaken for a religious war ,_,  saying prayers cannot end insurgence ._. I have never said prayers can help resolve the security challenges facing Nigeria ._.

Also a civil society organisation ,_,  Socio -_: Economic Rights and Accountability Project SERAP also said that the unlawful and unnecessary killings of many Nigerians at the Nyanya Motor Park ,_,  Abuja show that the measures the government is taking to tackle the Boko Haram phenomenon are inadequate and simply not working ._. Aturu in a statement he issued on the bombing ,_,  noted that Monday's attack has proved conclusively that the security agencies have no idea as to how to confront terrorism ._. He maintained that in spite of repeated assurances from government and the top hierarchy of the security agencies it is dawning by the day that we are the most insecure people on earth ._. He slso said ,_,  While the gruesome murder of people who have no hand in the current political and economic woes of this country must be condemned unreservedly ,_,  and we cannot have words harsh enough for the cowardly killing of defenceless persons ,_,  the truth remains that governments at all levels must be held squarely responsible for the state of penury and insecurity in Nigeria ._. Our hearts again go to the victims and families of the victims for the avoidable loss of lives ,_,  limbs and properties ._. 
Government must pay reparation to all the victims as it was its failure to provide security that led to the unfortunate incident ._.

These ceaseless killings require mass protest and I will be willing to participate in organsing it ._. 
Enough is enough ,_,  Aturu concluded ._. On its part ,_,  SERAP in a statement signed by it executive director ,_,  Adetokunbo Mumuni ,_,  urged President Goodluck Jonathan to show leadership and urgently initiate fundamental changes in the security strategy to end continuing civilian casualties ,_,  and a climate of insecurity across the country ._. 
The growing violence in Nigeria appears to be an intractable problem ._. 
It is polarizing the country and there is disagreement over its causes and how to combat it ._. Terror struck the Nigerian capital Abuja on Monday 14 ._. 04 ._. 201 when more than 70 people were killed and more than 120 were injured in an attack on a bus station packed with morning commuters ._. No one has claimed responsibility so far ._. 
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  however ,_,  accused the Islamist group Boko Haram ,_,  which has been carrying out attacks in the northeast of the country since 2009 ,_,  of being behind the bloodshed ._. The issue of Boko Haram is a quite an ugly history ,_,  Jonathan said while visiting the site a few hours after the bomb blast ._. 
But we will get over it ._. 
The issue of Boko Haram is temporary ._. Others might dispute that ._. 
The devastating attack on the bus station on the outskirts of the capital Abuja shows that Nigeria is apparently powerless in the face of the growing violence ._. 
This year alone ,_,  attacks by Boko Haram have claimed more than 1 ,_, 500 lives ._. Yahaya Shinku ,_,  a security expert and former major in the Nigerian Army told DW that the pattern of attacks has changed ._. He was referring to an increase in the frequency of the attacks and Boko Haram's willingness to strike at targets outside its strongholds in the northeast of Nigeria ._. More than 70 people have been killed in attack on a bus station in AbujaThe most dramatic change ,_,  according to observers ,_,  is that violence has now become completely random ._. There is no more recognizable ideological line in the selection of terrorist targets ,_,  said Hildegard Berendt -_: Kigozi ,_,  country coordinator of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation KAS in Abuja ._. For a long time ,_,  Boko Haram mainly attacked Nigerian state institutions such as the military ,_,  the police or schools ._. 
The goal of the group was to turn northern Nigerian into an Islamic state ._. But over the last few months Boko Haram members have been indiscriminately attacking northern Nigerian villages ._. 
Muslims have been among their victims ._. Speculation about possible motivesNo motive has been identified in the Monday's attack on commuters in Abuja ._. 
This is only to destabilize Nigeria Berendt -_: Kigozi said of the killings ._. Every terrorist group with an ideological line would discredit itself with such attacks ,_,  she added ._. 
The motive of the perpetrators of these attacks was apparently neither political nor religious ,_,  but to plunge the entire country into chaos ._. This is why no one has so far claimed responsibility for many of the recent indiscriminate attacks on the Nigerian soil ._. 
It could also mean that there will be no negotiations with the perpetrators ._. Yahaya Shinku suspects that there is a connection between this latest terror attack and the upcoming presidential elections due in February 2015 ._. You can not separate these attacks from the fact that we are nearing the 2015 elections ,_,  said Shinku ._.

But the officer who spoke with our correspondent said he didn't want his name in print because he was not in a position to speak ._. Since the FCT is not under the emergency rule ,_,  it would be wrong for us to react to that dastardly and cowardly act ,_,  he said ._. 
We hope these criminals and their sponsors would be exposed very soon ._.

Amaechi had written to the House requesting them to approve the money to enable the state government complete ongoing projects in the state ._.

Dear Reader ,_, Dozens of people were killed this morning when two bomb blasts hit a busy bus station on the outskirts of Abuja ,_,  Nigeria ._. 
No -_: one has claimed immediate responsibility for the attack ,_,  but suspicion has fallen on the militant group Boko Haram ._. 
The Islamist insurgents were reportedly behind an assault last week in the north -_: eastern Borno state in which at least 60 people were killed ,_,  and are believed to have been responsible for the abduction of two Italian priests and a Canadian nun in Cameroon at the start of the month ._. 
If their involvement in the kidnapping is confirmed ,_,  it will have been the group's third abduction in Cameroon and could signal a shift in tactics ._. Several sources within the African Peer Review Mechanism APRM ,_,  an instrument set up by the African Union to encourage good governance ,_,  have alleged that the organisation is fraught with high -_: level corruption ,_,  mismanagement and political manipulation ._. 
In an in -_: depth investigation conducted by Think Africa Press ,_,  officials as well as a number of senior figures in the APRM claimed that there has been widespread fraud and misuse of funds ,_,  and that the mechanism's integrity and independence have been undermined ._. 
Some allege that the responsibility for APRM's state of affairs goes right to the top ._. Momentum is continuing to build towards Egypt's 26 May elections ,_,  which are widely expected to see Abdel Fattah al -_: Sisi stroll into the presidential office ._. 
The rise of the field marshal to the presidency will see the military's grip tighten even further ,_,  but it is not just in the political arena that the army's power is likely to expand ._.

The Nigeria Labour Congress NLC has described as barbaric Monday's bomb blast at Nyanya bus park and called on the federal government to urgently implement the report of the presidential committee on Boko Haram as a step towards ending insurgency in the country ._. Labour in a statement by its President ,_,  Abdulwaheed Omar ,_,  said the attack was a wakeup call on government to do more to reassure Nigerians about their safety ,_,  adding that it takes more than regular effort to confront an enemy as resourceful as this ._. NLC said :_:  The bomb blasts early this morning yesterday at Nyanya Bus Stop ,_,  Abuja ,_,  which left scores dead ,_,  especially workers ,_,  is as barbaric as it is condemnable ._. 
It is a sore reminder that the battle against terror is far from over ._. 
It is also a reminder that there are no safe havens ._. Government needs to do more to reassure Nigerians about their safety as it takes more than regular effort to confront an enemy as resourceful as this ._. 
In the past three years ,_,  a sizable percentage of our national budget has been devoted to security ._. 
This should translate into better infrastructure ,_,  training and incentive for our personnel and not slush funds for dark interests ._. Our roads oftentimes are turned into a nightmare in the quest by our security personnel to apprehend terror suspects or frustrate their plans through the doctrine of pre -_: emption ,_,  yet it is doubtful if these personnel are sufficiently equipped for their tasks ._. 
More often than not it is guess work or application of psychology ,_,  yet the cold realities of our situation certainly require more than this ._. 
Government must tackle this terror through confrontation and through the depletion of their ranks via provision of education and jobs ._. We also call for the full and immediate implementation of the reports of the two committees set up by the federal government on Boko Haram ._. 
They made profound recommendations including the prosecution of those believed to have started the crisis ._. 
This great country cannot live in a perpetual state of terror ._. 
Nobel Laureate ,_,  Prof ._.  Wole Soyinka ,_,  Monday said the security challenges facing the country cannot be solved by prayers ,_,  but competence ._. Soyinka ,_,  who was a keynote speaker in Osogbo the Osun State capital ,_,  at a colloquium with the theme :_:  'Fundamental Imperatives of Cohabitation ,_,  Faith and Secularism ,_, ' organised by Centre for Black Culture and International Understanding CBCIU in Osogbo ,_,  added that he received with shock the news of Nyanya Motor Park bombing ,_,  calling for a frank talk among stakeholders in the affairs of the country to end the spate of bombings ._. Making reference to a report in a newspaper recently credited to him that the nation's security challenges can be resolved through prayers ,_,  Soyinka noted that Boko Haram insurgency should not be mistaken for a religious war ,_,  insisting that prayers alone cannot end the crises ._. According to him ,_,  I have never said prayer can help resolve the security challenges facing Nigeria ._. 
I believe the situation must be tackled without partisanship and all these uninformed comments cannot help the situation ._. 
We should wake up to the reality ,_,  Nigeria is in war and only competence can solve the problem ,_,  not prayers ,_,  Soyinka said ._. He said the country is in need of competent leaders with capacity to deal with the situation without partisanship and suggested that learning from the history of nations that had faced similar situations can help Nigeria survived her present challenges ._. He decried what he called spiritual contempt by both Christians and Muslims ,_,  whom he accused of hurling abuses at the adherents of traditional religion ._. 
He also accused them of exhibiting high degree of intolerance within themselves and to other religious beliefs ._. While calling for the teaching of comparative religion studies at primary and secondary school levels ,_,  the Chairman of Osogbo Centre for Black Culture and International Understanding ,_,  who is the convener of the colloquium ,_,  warned against preaching religious intolerance to the younger generation ._. The renowned scholar contended that the almajiris ,_,  whom he called foot soldiers of the Boko Haram had their minds poisoned at an early stage ._. He said the seed sown long time ago was responsible for the crises ravaging the country presently ._. In his message ,_,  Osun State Governor ,_,  Mr ._. 
Rauf Aregbesola ,_,  stressed that the only way to respect God was by showing respect to human beings ,_,  emphasising the need for people to accommodate adherents of other religions ._. He called for the practice of faith in a manner that encourages peaceful co -_: existence of people ,_,  adding that his administration in its activities and conducts had maintained a balance among all religions without placing one over the other ._. 
The Nigerian Minister of Defence is a senior cabinet official in the Federal Executive Council in charge of the Nigerian Ministry of Defence ._. 
The Defence Minister's main responsibility is to manage all branches of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria ,_,  to maintain a modern ,_,  competent ,_,  and professional military force for the protection of the national territory ,_,  maritime interests ,_,  airspace ,_,  and constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria ._. After independence ,_,  Nigeria's first Minister of Defence was Alhaji Muhammadu Ribadu 1910 -_: 65 ._. 
On May 1 ,_,  1965 ,_,  he was to be honoured ,_,  along with the then Prime Minister ,_,  Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa 1912 -_: 66 ,_,  by the then Premier of Northern Nigeria ,_,  Sir Ahmadu Bello 1909 -_: 66 with gold medals of the Usmamiya order in Kaduna ._. 
He died on the morning of that day at the age of 55 ._. No doubt ,_,  Alhaji Ribadu was a towering figure ._. 
A giant among men ._. 
He was ,_,  in all but name ,_,  the deputy Prime Minister ._. 
He was powerful and intrepid ._. Alhaji Ribadu was born at Bulala ,_,  in the present Adamawa state ._. 
He was active in politics in the Northern Region and entered the Northern House of Assembly in Kaduna in 1947 ._. 
Thus began a political career in which he rose rapidly ._. 
He soon became a leader of the Northern People's Congress NPC ,_,  founded in 1949 as a cultural organisation but soon turned into a political party in order to meet the requirements of the Macpherson Constitution ._. Under the leadership of the Sardauna of Sokoto ,_,  Sir Alhaji Ahmadu Bello ,_,  the most powerful politician during his era ,_,  the NPC ,_,  won all the Northern seats in Nigeria's first general elections of 1951 -_: 52 ,_,  and Alhaji Muhammadu Ribadu was one of the Northern candidates who won the election to the Federal House of Representatives in Lagos where he was appointed Minister of Natural Resources ._. 
He was previously a director of the Nigerian Produce Marketing Company ,_,  but resigned this post on becoming a Minister ._. In 1954 ,_,  he was appointed Federal Minister of Land ,_,  Mines and Power ._. 
He served in that ministry until 1957 when he was transferred to the portfolio of Lagos Affairs ._. 
He was second Vice -_: President of the NPC ,_,  and one of the most influential leaders of the NPC -_: dominated regime in the Federation ._. 
He received a British decoration ,_,  being awarded the MBE in 1952 ._. While serving as Minister of Defence ,_,  Ribadu presided over a rapid expansion of the Nigerian Army ,_,  Navy as well as the creation of the Nigeria Air Force ._. 
He established the Defence Industries Corporation in Kaduna ,_,  the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna and a Second Recce Squadron in Abeokuta ._. 
He got practically all his budgetary requests through parliament ,_,  including approval to spend 19 ._. 5 million pounds on defence from 1962 -_: 66 as compared with 5 ._. 5 million pounds during the preceding seven year period ._. 
Defence costs as a percentage of Federal recurrent spending from 1958 -_: 1966 ranged from 7 ._. 7 to 9 ._. 9% ._. 
Defence costs as a percentage of Federal capital spending during the same period ranged from 1 ._. 5 to 12 ._. 1% ._. Ribadu lost the Chairmanship of the Economic Committee of the federal cabinet in 1964 ,_,  a position he had used skilfully to protect and oversee his defence appropriations ._. 
His colleagues often refer to him as power of powers ._. 
He completed the Nigerianisation of the Nigerian Army ._. 
Till today he's still being remembered as one of the most outstanding Defence Minister Nigeria ever had ._. If we remember Alhaji Ribadu in �clat ,_,  valour and repute and for his giant strides ,_,  we must also note in glory and prowess the two permanent secretaries and the four Ministers of State who served under him ._. Alhaji Abdul Azeez Attah 1920 -_: 1972 served as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Defence between 1960 -_: 1964 and handed over to Alhaji Sule Dede Kolo 88 who is from Jos ,_,  Plateau state ._. From 1960 to August 1961 ,_,  a physician ,_,  Dr ._.  Moses Adekoyejo Majekodunmi CFR 1916 -_: 2012 ,_,  was Minister of State for the Army ._. 
He handed over to an Idoma businessman and politician ,_,  Chief Jacob Obande who is from Elilazi ,_,  Igumale ,_,  in the present Benue state ._. Alhaji Ibrahim Tako Galadima ,_,  who was an ex -_: student of Government College ,_,  Bida ,_, Niger state ,_,  took over from Chief Obande in January 1963 and served till January 1966 ._. 
Alhaji Galadima ,_,  according to the famous writer Dan Agbese ,_,  recruited almost all the famous Generals including General Ibrahim Babangida ,_,  Gado Nasko ,_,  Abdulsalam Abubakar ,_,  Mamman Vatsa ,_,  Sanni Bello and others ,_,  particularly from Niger state ,_,  into the Nigerian Army ._. Chief Matthew Tawo Mbu 1929 -_: 2012 served as Minister of Navy from 1960 -_: 1965 under Alhaji Ribadu ._. 
Chief Mbu from Okundi in Ogoja area of present Cross Rivers state ,_,  had earlier served as Nigeria's first High Commissioner to the United Kingdom between 1955 -_: 1959 ._. 
He was also the First Nigerian representative to the United Nations ._. After the death of Alhaji Ribadu ,_,  Alhaji Inua Wada ,_,  Uncle to late General Murtala Muhammed was appointed Minister of Defence ._. 
There was little he could do until the Military coup of January 15 ,_,  1966 ._. 
Many scholars and historians believe till today that if Alhaji Ribadu had been alive the January 15 ,_,  1966 military coup could not have taken place ._. 
That he would have prevented it and that the first republic in spite of all incidents would have survived ._. 
And that we would not have been in this mess today ._. Since Alhaji Inua Wada ,_,  Nigeria has had many Defence Ministers namely Major General Iliya Bisalla 1975 -_: 1976 ,_,  Professor Iya Abubakar 1979 -_: 1981 ,_,  Alhaji Akanbi Oniyangi 1971 -_: 1983 ,_,  General Domkat Bali 1984 -_: 1990 ,_,  General Sani Abacha 1990 -_: 1994 ,_,  General rtd ._. 
Yakubu Theophilus Danjuma 1999 -_: 2003 ,_,  Alhaji Rabiu Kwankwaso 2003 -_: 2007 ,_,  Alhaji Yayale Ahmed 2007 -_: 2008 ,_,  Alhaji Shettima Mustapha 2008 -_: 2009 ,_,  Major General rtd ._. 
Godwin Abbe 2009 -_: 2010 ,_,  Adetokunbo Kayode 2010 -_: 2011 and Dr ._.  Bello Haliru Muhammed 2011 -_: July 2012 ._. Of all the Defence Ministers ,_,  none has resumed in office during war -_: like periods such as the incumbent ,_,  General rtd ._. 
Aliyu Muhammed Gusau ._. I think it is not by accident that he has been picked at this period to serve as Defence Minister ._. 
He has all the credentials ._. General Aliyu Gusau ended his military career as Chief of Army staff ._. 
His long tenure as National Security Adviser is still unequalled ._. 
He has been director -_:  general of National Security Organisation NSO ._. 
He was once Director of Military Intelligence ._. 
He was once Chairman of Joint Intelligence Board ._. 
He has been Director of Defence Intelligence Agency ._. 
To top it all ,_,  he has friends ._. 
Many friends ._. War is no longer being waged like in the past in the conventional way ._. 
Things have changed ._. 
For a war to be won now ,_,  there must be a great input from the intelligence unit ._. 
For example in the United States ,_,  the Secretary of Defence ,_,  which is Minister of Defence to us ,_,  by the Goldwater -_: Nichols DOD Reorganisation Act of 1986 ,_,  has combatant control of the Defense Information Systems Agency ,_,  the Defense Nuclear Agency ,_,  the Defence Logistics Agency ,_,  the Defense Intelligence Agency ,_,  the National Security Agency ,_,  the Defense Mapping Agency and the Central Imagery Office ._. In addition the Secretary of Defence gives policy guidance and direction to other supporting organisations ,_,  including the Joint Tactical Command and ,_,  Control ,_,  and Communications Agency ,_,  the Electromagnetic Compatibility Analysis Centre ,_,  the Military Communications Electronics Board ,_,  and the Joint Doctrine Centre ._. Even in the United Kingdom ,_,  the Minister of Defence is the Chairman of Defense Council and all other bodies ,_,  namely the Admiralty ,_,  the Army Board and the Air Force board report directly to him ._. 
In return ,_,  he is accountable to the Queen and the parliament ._. In relation to our present war in the North -_: East ,_,  if we are to go by the American experience ,_,  the Minister of Defence must have complete control on Specified and Unified Command so as to avoid duplication of efforts ._. This Boko Haram war has brought dejection ,_,  depression and melancholy to us all ._. 
Many homes are today in anguish and despondency ._. 
Thousands ,_,  if not millions ,_,  have been displaced because of this war ._. 
It must and it should end ._. 
The continuation of this war cannot be justified ._. 
It is the duty of a General to fight a war ._. 
It is also the duty of a General to stop a war ._. 
I believe it is the duty of General Aliyu Gusau to help stop this war ._. Eric Teniola was a Director at the Presidency ._. 
He lives in Lagos ._. 
Anger reverberated across Nigeria Monday after an early morning blast ,_,  which triggered further explosions ,_,  killed at least 71 people and wounded 124 more at a packed car park in Nyanya ,_,  an outskirt of Abuja a few minutes' drive from the presidential villa ._. The victims were mostly workers travelling to Abuja's city centre for work ,_,  people selling food and recharge cards at the park ,_,  hustlers who loaded vehicles for a tip ,_,  and motorcycle riders ferrying residents from the nearby communities to the motor station ._. The powerful blast tore through the crowded station at about 6 ._. 30 a ._. m ,_,  triggering further detonations as the fuel tanks of nearby cars caught fire ._. Police spokesperson ,_,  Frank Mba ,_,  said the blast destroyed 16 luxury coaches and 24 minibuses ._. But residents of the area and body count by a PREMIUM TIMES' reporter at the scene ,_,  suggest a higher toll of nearly 200 ._. No one has claimed responsibility immediately for the attack ,_,  but President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  who visited the scene blamed the extremist Boko Haram sect ,_,  responsible for similar attacks in the past ._. Speaking while almost moved to tears ,_,  President Jonathan sought to reassure a heartbroken nation that grew more alarmed as the figures of the dead and the wounded became clearer ._. It is not the number ,_,  let me appeal to our country men and women ,_,  for them to continue to work very hard on this issue of Boko Haram ,_,  he said ._. We shall get over it ._. 
We want to appeal to our media to begin to come up with enlightenment programme for our people ,_,  to make citizens very aware of suspicious movement so that they can be reported promptly to security agencies ,_,  he said ._. Boko Haram ,_,  which operates more in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States ,_,  had repeatedly threatened in video messages to launch an attack on Abuja to demonstrate its reach and resilience after a crushing effort by the military to exterminate it for years ._. We just heard a loud explosion and many people died instantly ._. 
In fact ,_,  many people were scattered into pieces ,_,  Dalhatu Garba ,_,  a driver of one of the long buses ,_,  who survived the attack ,_,  told PREMIUM TIMES ._. 
Apart from our buses ,_,  many other smaller cars also come in to pick passengers especially those going on long journey ._. Anger spread across the nation Monday as graphic images of the attack were distributed and posted online showing mangled victims of the attack ._. 
One image showed a lifeless man sitting ,_,  leaning on one of the high capacity buses; besides him ,_,  two other bodies lay bloodied and dismembered ._. For most of Monday ,_,  calls rang from Nigerians outside the capital city seeking reassurances their relatives in Abuja were not affected ._. One of the worst things that can happen to anyone is to be uncertain about the whereabouts of a loved one ,_,  one Twitter post ,_,  from the handle Kob' @Mhagayr ,_,  read ._. The National Human Rights Commission ,_,  NHRC ,_,  said there was no justification for the killing by any group or person ._. A former Vice President ,_,  Atiku Abubakar ,_,  described those behind the bombing as evil and callous and said the attack is a wake -_: up call for Nigerians to stop trading blames and work together to end the scourge of insecurity ._. We are all guilty of expending endless energy on handwringing and the trading of blame ,_,  none of which is able to save lives or change the status quo ,_,  he said in a statement ._. The attack on Abuja by Boko Haram -_: if the group is eventually confirmed to be behind the Nyanya blast -_:  would be the first in two years ,_,  following from a suicide bomb attack on the United Nations building in 2011 and another on the police headquarters in the central business district in 2010 ._. Witnesses said a lone Volkswagen car laden with explosives drove into the Nyanya bus station where many working class citizens board vehicles for daily routines in the city centre ._. 
The car exploded shortly after near a row of buses filled with passengers and ready to leave ._. 
The police however did not confirm that narrative ._. The blast sent a strong shock wave to distant parts of Abuja and several fragmented bodies littered the car park's blood -_: stained soil ._. 
The explosion left a wide crater in the middle of the park ,_,  dozens of car wrecks and a thick smoke billowing as rescue personnel gathered severed human parts and rushed the injured to hospitals ._. Analysts believe if true Boko Haram was responsible for the attack ,_,  it would be a powerful message to Nigeria's central government which has struggled to contend an increasingly sophisticated and daring enemy ._. Nigeria has seen a flurry of violence ahead of general polls next year with hundreds also killed nearly every week in clashes in other parts of the north between farmers and herdsmen over grazing rights ._. Boko Haram first launched an onslaught against all symbols of state authority in 2009 in a loose conflict that has proven ever deadly with multiple bomb and gun attacks in the following years ,_,  with thousands killed ._. In 2014 alone ,_,  at least 1500 people ,_,  more than half of who are civilians ,_,  have been killed ,_,  Amnesty International said in a report published March 31 ._. The human rights organisation said many of those killed were victims of Boko Haram and uncontrolled reprisals by Nigeria's security forces ._. 
Former Vice -_: President Atiku Abubakar ,_,  former Lagos State Governor ,_,  Senator Bola Tinubu and former Anambra State Governor ,_,  Mr ._. 
Peter Obi ,_,  have expressed sympathy for the victims of the bombing of the Nyanya Bus Park ._. The trio ,_,  in separate reactions to the incident ,_,  decried the attack and urged the federal government to intensify its efforts in ensuring safety of lives and property ._. In a statement from his media office in Abuja ,_,  Atiku however queried the sincerity in the recent claim by the government that Boko Haram insurgents have been driven out of the main centres of Nigeria ._. He recalled that government had in February ,_,  spoken about its successes in pushing Boko Haram to the fringes of the North -_: east ,_,  adding that yesterday's bombing had cast doubts on that claim ._. According to him ,_,  the latest bombings by insurgents both in Abuja and the North -_: east should be a wake -_: up call to all Nigerians on the imperative of ending the trade -_: blame game and working together to end the insurgency ._. On his part ,_,  Tinubu in a condolence message to families of the victims ,_,  said there was need for Nigeria to go back to the drawing board ._. 
The Jonathan administration has not devised a grand strategy against this menace ,_,  either locally or internationally ,_,  he said ._. Tinubu ,_,  in a statement he personally signed ,_,  said :_:  There is a glaring failure of intelligence ._. 
The tempo and consistency of attacks suggest that this government's approach is not only wrong but also wrongheaded ._. He urged the federal government to partner the international community on convening a security summit under the auspices of the African Union AU for Nigeria ,_,  Chad ,_,  Cameroun and Niger to discuss the menace of terrorism in the sub region ._. While grieving with the bereaved families ,_,  Tinubu said the episode was another gloomy chapter not only for families ,_,  but it reinforces the fear and vulnerability of Nigerians ._. For Obi ,_,  the Nyanya bomb blast was a mindless war against innocent Nigerians ._. 
The former governor in a statement wondered what the perpetrators of the act stand to gain ,_,  saying it was worrisome that innocent Nigerians were confronted by barbarians that did not have respect for the sacredness of human lives ._. The strange culture of people killing fellow humans without compunction can at best be described as atavistic throwback to the old and superseded ways ._. 
To observe those traits of barbarism creeping back to our country calls for concerted efforts to check ,_,  he said ._. Caption :_:  Justice Idris Kutigi ,_,  Chairman National conference Venue National Conference Forced to Adjourn  -_:  Security beefed up at venue Chuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo   The National Conference was forced into an abrupt adjournment Monday following the inability of the secretariat to adequately place delegates into their respective committees and rumours of a fresh bomb attack ,_,  aside that of Nyanya ._. 
The conference is expected to resume plenary today ._. The bomb attack also made security agents at the venue of the conference in Abuja to be more vigilant as they search every vehicle entering the venue while the surroundings were policed by security men ._. At Monday's plenary session ,_,  a delegate ,_,  Ishaq Kawu Modibo ,_,  while moving a motion ,_,  sponsored by 19 delegates ,_,  said the security situation in the country had been deteriorating in the last five years ,_,  while the last two months had witnessed escalation of security breaches in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States with attendant loss of human lives and property ._. But before the motion was adopted ,_,  Mr ._. 
Femi Falana called for an amendment to the motion to call on the federal government to implement the reports of the committees set up by the federal government and headed by Minister of Special Duties ,_,  Alhaji Kabiru Tanimu Turaki and the Sheik Ahmed Lemu ._. After the adoption of the motion ,_,  the conference proceeded to work ,_,  but surprisingly ,_,  the members were disappointed that the secretariat had not concluded work on the distribution of delegates to the respective committees ._. Besides ,_,  members were not satisfied with the structure of committees and called for some adjustments to be made to reflect the work plan of the conference ._. A former President of the Nigerian Bar Association NBA ,_,  Mr ._. 
Olisa Agbakoba SAN explained that there was no need for the conference to have 20 committees and called for the reduction of the committees to four ._. It was at this stage news filtered in that there was another bomb blast in the Jabi District of Abuja and the delegates started leaving the venue of the conference ._. But the conference Chairman ,_,  Justice Idris Kutigi ,_,  in a diplomatic manner ,_,  announced the adjournment of the conference ._. 
According to him ,_,  We are still working on the committee ._. 
The restructuring and allotment of delegates is not ready ._. 
We promise that the placement of members into committees would be ready tomorrowtoday ._. 
The conference is therefore adjourned till 4pm tomorrow today ._. It was later gathered that the rumour of a fresh bomb explosion in the Abuja was false ._. However ,_,  some of the delegates decried the bomb attack in Nyanya with a former Peoples Democratic Party PDP Deputy Chairman ,_,  Chief Bode George ,_,  describing yesterday as a sad day for the country ._. It is a very sad day for Nigeria ._. 
I supported the motion that the government should do something urgently to address the insecurity issue ._. 
Nyanya is just next door to Aso Rock here ._. 
I believe that a wake -_: up call has already been on but there is need to get to the root cause of it ,_,  he said ._. Another delegate ,_,  Uwajumogu Chidinma from Imo State ,_,  urged the federal government to take measures to end the wanton killings of innocent Nigerians ._. She said it would amount to being insensitive if the conference did not take note of the bombings and insecurity situation in the country ._. 
On his part ,_,  constitutional lawyer ,_,  Chief Mike Ozoekhome ,_,  said the bomb blast had vindicated his position last week when he harped on issues of insecurity and religious conflict ._. Only last week in my contribution ,_,  I left other controversial and emotive issues like federalism ,_,  regionalism ,_,  structure of government and resource control ._. 
I left all them and dwelt strictly on the issue of security because if we do not have security ,_,  nobody will be talking about sharing a national cake which is what resource control is all about ._. 
If we have the security problems ,_,  we won't even talk about the restructure of government ._. 
After life ,_,  the next thing is liberty and then security because if you are dead you do not need any of them ._. 
But once you are alive you need security and liberty ,_,  he added ._.

Chairman ,_,  House Committee on FCT ,_,  Hon ._. 
Emmanuel JimeAPC -_: Benue ,_,  while condemning the attack ,_,  called on the federal government to investigate and expose those behind it ._. Our hearts and prayers go to the victims and their families and loved ones ._. 
Once again the enemy has struck ,_,  maiming ,_,  killing and destroying ._. 
At a time like this ,_,  we are called to stand as one people with a shared destiny ._. 
We must resolve to defeat our enemies ._. 
Those who perpetrate this devilish acts must have no peace ,_,  no hiding place ,_,  Jime said ._. His colleague in the House ,_,  Hon ._. 
Ibrahim Shehu Gusau ,_,  described the incident as a callous act and urged the federal government to find ways of curbing ,_,  once and for all ,_,  the spate of insecurity in the country ._. 
According to him ,_,  innocent people who set out in search of their daily bread ,_,  should have been spared the agonies ._. He said with the level of insecurity in the country ,_,  government should vote a lot of resources towards ending the crisis ._. I think a lot of money needs to be put into security ._. 
No amount of money would be too much for security issues ._. 
It is high time that government give it the attention is requires ,_,  he added ._. PDP's National Vice -_: Chairman South -_: east Col Austin Akobundu rtd ,_,  in his reaction ,_,  expressed grief over the killing of innocent Nigerians and described those behind the blast as enemies of humanity ,_,  democracy and good governance ._. He urged security operatives to rise up to the challenge by wiping out terrorism in the country ._. 
The South -_: south campaign office for the re -_: election of President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 was Monday inaugurated in Uyo ,_,  Akwa Ibom State capital by notable politicians in the region ,_,  under the umbrella of the Goodluck Support Group GSG ._. A former Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State ,_,  Mr ._. 
Nsima Ekere ,_,  told THISDAY that the people of the south -_: south were passionate about the President's re -_: election in the 2015 polls ._. We believe Mr ._. 
President must be given a chance by Nigerians to succeed in 2015 ._. 
Any government no matter its nature ,_,  no matter where the leader is from or the language he speaks ,_,  if he does not have the support of the electorate first of all ,_,  the government will lack legitimacy and will not be focused ,_,  he said ._. Ekere who is a member of the Elders' Council of the GSG stressed the need for the electorate to support President Jonathan's bid for him to continue to focus on governance and delivery of the dividend of democracy during the second term ._. He maintained that Nigerians must be patient with the President because the areas of complain like road ,_,  power and other public infrastructure did not become bad during the regime of President Jonathan ._. The road infrastructure and decayed power didn't become bad overnight ._. 
The railway that Mr ._. 
President is now putting on track didn't get bad overnight ._. 
The problems that confront us as a nation and People didn't just happen overnight ._. 
These are things that happened overtime ._. If you look at his programme ,_,  the Transformation Agenda ,_,  Mr ._. 
President is tackling the key areas where we have need as a country such as power ._. The good thing is that we are now on track and that is why we must support Mr ._. 
President so that he continues to lead this country well ._. If we distort what we have now ,_,  it is going to take a long time to begin to prepare another person to start a new plan ,_,  he stressed ._. 
On security ,_,  Ekere who is a governorship aspirant in the state observed that President Jonathan had personal commitment to the security of live and property and the fight against Boko Haram and militancy ._. You can agree that Nigeria and Europe are not on the same pedestal in term of technology ._. 
It will take time for us to get to the level of military and intelligence sophistications of the developed world ._. 
We must admit that given the challenges and circumstances of our country and the resources at our disposal ,_,  President Jonathan is doing his best in the area of fighting insurgency ,_,  he said ._. 
Two years after a bomb blast hit the office of THISDAY Newspapers in the Federal Capital Territory FCT ,_,  it was a black Monday yesterday in Nyanya ,_,  a suburb of Abuja ,_,  when a bomb -_: laden ,_,  red Volkswagen Golf car ,_,  with number plate XQ229LSD ,_,  exploded at a bus park in the neighborhood ,_,  killing 71 people and injuring 124 others ._. The chassis number of the vehicle ,_,  26AS 9730302621 ,_,  was still visible on the engine after the blast ._. 
The tragic incident ,_,  which occurred between 6 ._. 30 am and 6 ._. 45 am ,_,  destroyed about 16 luxury buses otherwise known as el -_: Rufai; named after the former FCT Minister ,_,  Nasir el -_: Rufai ,_,  of which four of them were said to have been filled with over 50 passengers ._. Also ,_,  several commercial motorcycles ,_,  mini -_: buses and cars parked within the motor park were burnt beyond recognition ._. Owing to the bomb blast ,_,  security in and around the FCT was immediately beefed up ,_,  forcing President Goodluck Jonathan and Senate President David Mark to cancel their engagements ._. 
They visited the scene of the attack and the injured at the hospital ,_,  with the president promising Nigerians that the federal government would defeat terrorism ._. The scene of the ugly incident ,_,  which was littered with horrifying images of dismembered bodies and blood soaked vehicles ,_,  was immediately cordoned off by security men and rescue agencies ,_,  who swung into action to ascertain the number of casualties and carry out investigations on the attack ._. Most of the dead and injured were taken to various hospitals in the FCT by rapid response teams of National Emergency Management Agency NEMA ,_,  Federal Road Safety Commission FRSC ,_,  Vehicle Inspection Officers VIO ,_,  Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps NSCDC ,_,  and Nigeria Police Force NPF ,_,  while an appreciable number of military men and experts were also at the scene to maintain order ._. Giving a breakdown of the casualties ,_,  the Director General of NEMA ,_,  Mohammed Sani Sidi ,_,  following a visit to hospitals in the FCT ,_,  said the Abuja Clinic had four injured victims; Nyanya General Hospital  -_:  11 injured victims; Customs Hospital ,_,  Karu  -_:  14 injured victims and one dead person; Asokoro Clinic  -_:  25 injured victims and 27 dead; and Maitama Hospital  -_:  27 injured victims and 14 dead bodies ._. Others included Wuse General Hospital with 10 injured and 15 dead; National Hospital ,_,  Abuja  -_:  25 wounded and 14 dead; Garki Hospital had one injured; and Medical Centre ,_,  Maraba had seven injured victims ,_,  bringing the total number of dead persons to 71 and 124 injured victims ._. Reacting to the terror attack at the bus park ,_,  Jonathan expressed shock at the unfortunate incident that claimed several lives and injured 124 others ._. The president ,_,  who also visited the injured victims at the Asokoro General Hospital in the FCT ,_,  in the company of Mark ,_,  Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP ,_,  Alhaji Adamu Mu'azu ,_,  service chiefs and some ministers ,_,  assured Nigerians that the Boko Haram menace was temporary ,_,  as the country would overcome it ._. The president ,_,  on behalf of Nigerians ,_,  expressed condolences to the families of those who suffered directly from the incident ._. I am also commending security services for their prompt action ._. 
However ,_,  we lost quite a number of people ,_,  so we condole with our countrymen and women ._. 
We will continue to work very hard ._. 
The issue of Boko Haram is temporary ._. 
Government is doing everything to make sure that we move our country forward in spite of all the distractions that want to take us backward ._. We promise that we will get over it ._. 
We also want to use this unique opportunity to plead with the media and our great men and women to come up with enlightenment programmes for our people ._. Those countries that face terrorism have developed great awareness ._. 
If there are unusual movement of vehicles and bags ,_,  they call security agencies and based on this a lot of incidents are contained ._. So we believe that if people become observant and all of us become security conscious of the movement of people ,_,  we will be able to reduce some of these incidents ._. We will do our best ,_,  the security services will continue to work very hard ._. 
God willing we will get over it ._. 
The issue of Boko Haram is temporary surely we will get over it ,_,  Jonathan said ._. The president after leaving the scene of the bomb blast ,_,  visited the injured at the Asokoro General Hospital ._. 
The Inspector -_: General of Police IG Mohammed Abubakar also visited the scene of the explosion ,_,  where he assessed the extent of damage and the impact on the surrounding environment ._. Abubakar ,_,  during the visit ,_,  urged Abuja residents and the international community to remain calm and vigilant as the police and other security agencies were stepping up measures to uncover the culprits of the crime and avoid a recurrence of the unfortunate incident ._. 
He further noted that security agents have relentlessly worked round the clock with significant success to stave off such attacks on the FCT and the entire country at large and therefore reassured Nigerians and foreign nationals that security agencies would do everything possible to further strengthen the security within and beyond the nation's capital ._. He said the police had been placed on red alert ,_,  adding :_:  We have equally ordered the police to intensify surveillance on all vulnerable targets within Abuja ._. He noted that the police were being supported by other law enforcement agencies and had commenced a full -_: scale investigation into the incident with the deployment of the Police Anti -_: Bomb Squad and other detectives to the scene with a view to solving the crime ._. Regrettably ,_,  71 persons have been confirmed dead while 124 persons sustained various degrees of injuries ,_,  he confirmed ._. While commiserating with the families of the victims of the blasts ,_,  the IG called on members of the public to go about their normal businesses without fear and to cooperate with the police by providing useful information in order to ensure that the perpetrators of the bomb attack are brought to book ._. Also speaking to journalists at the scene ,_,  the Force Public Relations Officer ,_,  Frank Mba ,_,  said the explosion occurred at 6 ._. 45 am during the rush hour ,_,  destroying many vehicles and large number of casualties ._. Mba reconfirmed that 16 luxury buses were razed ,_,  while 24 other vehicles were also destroyed in the blast ._. He said information centres would be open at all the hospitals where survivors were being attended to in order to provide information for their families ._. He added that experts from the Bomb Disposal Squad Unit of the police had combed the area ,_,  with security personnel placed on red alert throughout the FCT ._. The agencies are already paying very close attention to all vulnerable points including bus parks ,_,  he said ._. Mba further advised the public to avoid unnecessary huge crowds and be security conscious at all times ._. 
He said most of the affected passengers were workers and petty traders who were to be conveyed by commercial vehicles to the metropolis ._. In the same vein ,_,  the Director of Search and Rescue ,_,  NEMA ,_,  Air Commodore Charles Otegbade ,_,  confirmed that they were alerted of the bomb blast at 6 ._. 45 am and swiftly deployed their men to the scene to help rescue and evacuate the wounded ,_,  as well as the dead to the hospital ._. 
The Sultan of Sokoto ,_,  Alhaji Sa'ad Abubakar III ,_,  has said there are no plans to turn Nigeria into an Islamic nation ._. Abubakar ,_,  who is also the President -_: General ,_,  Jamatu Nasril Islam JNI ,_,  made this known at the golden jubilee lecture of the JNI in Kaduna late Sunday ._. Nobody can Islamise Nigeria ,_,  if Allah wanted he would have made everybody Muslims ,_,  so also with Christianity ._. 
God would have made everybody Christians if He wanted ,_,  he said ._. He stressed the need for the people to set aside ethno -_: religious differences and be committed towards the peace and development of the nation ._. The sultan said JNI's criticism of certain policies of the present government was a wakeup call for government or those in leadership positions to do what is right ._. 
He said JNI's action was not aimed at fighting the government or any group or religion ._. Abubakar however decried the insecurity that has pervaded many parts of the nation ,_,  especially the North -_: east by the Boko Haram insurgents ._. He said the activities of the insurgents should not be seen as an attempt by Muslims to persecute Christians or turn Nigeria into an Islamic country ._. Abubakar appealed to Christians and other faithful to join hands with Muslims to tackle the present security challenges and other problems facing the country ._. 
He also urged them to see Islam as a peaceful religion ._. In his goodwill message ,_,  Vice -_: President Namadi Sambo said the present administration would continue to support JNI in its programmes ._. 
Sambo reiterated the commitment of the federal government in tackling insecurity and illiteracy in the country ._. He also assured the Islamic body of the government's effort to address the constant clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in some states of the federation ._. Governor Mukhtar Yero of Kaduna State urged JNI to play its role in defusing tensions based on interpretations of Allah's revelations ._. This ,_,  Yero said ,_,  the Islamic organisation could do by encouraging Islamic scholars and preachers to dwell more on the five pillars of Islam ._. He also stressed the need for the body to collaborate with other inter -_: faith dialogue organisations towards promoting peace and unity in the nation ._. 
The Speaker ,_,  House of Representatives ,_,  Hon ._. 
Aminu Tambuwal ,_,  governors ,_,  traditional leaders and Islamic scholars attended the occasion ._. 
John Shiklam writes on the efforts of the committee set up by the Inspector General of Police ,_,  Mohammed Abubakar ,_,  to resolve the frequent clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in some parts of the country and the quest for justice by some groupsApart from the Boko Haram insurgency in the north -_: eastern part of the country that has led to several loss of lives ,_,  the new wave of killings in the Middle Belt ,_,  particularly ,_,  in Plateau ,_,  Benue ,_,  Nasarawa and Taraba States ,_,  as well as the Southern part of Kaduna by some Fulani herdsmen is creating a serious tension and social dislocation in the affected states ._. Clearly ,_,  since President Goodluck Jonathan coasted to victory in the 2011 presidential election ,_,  there had been intense attacks on rural communities in those states ,_,  thus fuelling the insinuations that the attack on residents of the Middle Belt in particular has much to do with their voting for Jonathan during the election ._. The attacks ,_,  most of which often take place during the night have led to the killing of hundreds of people and the destruction of property worth billions of naira ._. However ,_,  some people have dismissed such insinuations as totally incorrect ._. 
They argued that it was simply a conflict between the Fulani herdsmen and farmers ._. Accordingly ,_,  the Fulani herdsmen have repeatedly accused the natives in those communities of stealing their cows ,_,  while the farmers accused the Fulanis of destroying their farmlands ._. To be sure ,_,  the attacks had been so fierce such that sophisticated weapons were used during previous attacks ._. 
That ,_,  of course has left devastating effect on the concerned communities ._. In the whole of the middle belt region ,_,  these deadly attacks on rural communities have not only displaced thousands of people ,_,  but their economic and social activities have also been affected ._. So recently ,_,  the Inspector -_: General of Police ,_,  Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar set up a committee to resolve this lingering crisis between the Fulani herdsmen and farmers in some parts of the country ._. The committee headed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police in Charge of Operations ,_,  Michael Zuokumor was mandated to find an alternative dispute resolution geared towards finding a lasting solution to the clashes ._. 
The committee was thus directed to visit all the affected states and liaise with the police commands as well as the governors and other stakeholders to resolve the crises ._. 
In an interview with THISDAY when the committee visited Kaduna ,_,  Mr ._. 
Zuokumor noted that constant clashes between the Fulani herdsmen and farmers all over the federation which often leads to the destruction of lives and property ,_,  was becoming worrisome for the IGP ,_,  hence his decision to set up the committee known as Peace and Security Committee ._. According to him ,_,  the mandate of the committee was to look into the crises in order to find a lasting solution ._. He said the committee visited Benue State ,_,  where several villages were raided and many people killed in the wake of the crises ._. According to the DIG ,_,  who told THISDAY that his committee interacted with all the people involved in the crises ,_,  the findings revealed that in Benue State three groups ,_,  namely ,_,  Fulanis ,_,  the Tivs and the Aghatus were the protagonists and antagonists of the crises ._. Zuokumor said :_:  When we held a meeting with them ,_,  we discovered that we could reconcile them ._. 
We reconciled them and they called for a cease fire ._. 
They agreed on certain areas and they came out with a document that signified that peace accord was reached ._. 
They agreed to cease hostility against each other ._. 
Since our meeting with them we have not had any ethnic -_: related problem in Benue State till date ._. We discovered that the problems in Benue State were linked to that of Nasarawa State ,_,  so we went to Nasarawa State ,_,  where we met with the emir of Lafia and the governor of the state ._. 
The other traditional rulers in the state were all there as well ,_,  because they were determined to have peace in their domains ,_,  he said ._. The police officer hinted that the farmers and the Fulanis in Nasarawa States were ready to make peace ._. 
He disclosed that the Fulanis in the state who had gone into a hidden came out in large number to welcome the committee ._. But there was something we noticed ._. 
While so many people were very happy that peace was returning ,_,  we noticed that some people didn't want peace ._. 
The Fulanis who attacked the farmers are mostly from Nasarawa State ._. 
They came in large number and we set up a committee of Fulanis and farmers who renounced all forms of violence against each other and agreed to work together ._. 
From the time we visited till now April 8 ,_,  we have not heard of any ethnic clash in Benue or Nasarawa State ,_,  he said ._. He added :_:  The problem in Taraba State was quite different from these other states ._. 
The Tivs ,_,  Jukuns and the Fulanis are there ._. 
The Fulanis and Tivs have their challenges ,_,  but sometimes one group will say that the Jukuns are supporting either the Tivs or Fulanis ._. 
So that also makes them to be victims ._. 
If the Fulanis are coming to Wukari ,_,  the Tivs will run away ,_,  if Tivs are coming ,_,  the Fulanis will run away ._. But these groups are not a threat to each other in Wukari ._. 
It is those coming from outside Wukari that are problems to them ._. 
We noticed this when we went there ._. 
The Hausas are not having problem with anybody ._. 
The traditional ruler ,_,  the AKu Uka was very helpful ._. 
We told them the importance of living together ._. 
Nigeria is uniquely created by God and there is enough for all Nigerians ._. 
About 85 per cent of Nigerian land is arable ._. 
We have not used 25 per cent of it which means the bulk of it is yet to be exploited ._. 
There is a huge potential to support either Fulanis or farmers ._. 
We made this known to them and they were very happy ._. 
We held another meeting in Jalingo ,_,  the state capital ._. 
One or two people at the meeting were not comfortable with the prospect of cessation of hostilities ._. There was a particular man who was very hostile ,_,  he was saying that over his dead body ,_,  there could be no reconciliation but when he later came to meet me ,_,  I addressed him and he ended up being the one who read the peace accord that was signed ._. 
All the states report to me to tell me whether their area is calm or is not calm ._. 
Today April 8 ,_,  it was reported to me that Taraba state is totally calm ._. 
That is a success ,_,  the DIG said ._. In Kaduna State ,_,  where there had been constant attacks in its southern part ,_,  the committee met with leaders of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union SOKAPU ,_,  an umbrella body for the Christian dominated ethnic groups in the southern part of Kaduna State and leaders of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria MACBAN ,_,  Kaduna State chapter ._. Other stakeholders in attendance at the meeting were leaders of the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore Socio cultural Association ,_,  Mobgai Fulbe Development Association ,_,  the Moroa Development Association ,_,  the Atakar Community Development Association and the Laduga Development Association ._. At the end of the deliberations ,_,  they signed a peace agreement ,_,  promising to live in peace with one another and called for the establishment of a Peace and Reconciliation Commission by the Kaduna State government ._. They also urged that the movement of people in the state should be closely monitored by government in collaboration with the traditional rulers and other relevant agencies ._. The stakeholders ,_,  all of who endorsed the peace agreement further urged that government should make all efforts to reach out to nomadic pastoralists and other internally displaced persons for the purpose of giving them palliatives and encouraging them to return to their original places of abode ._. 
They also made the case for traditional intelligence gathering mechanisms ._. They also called for the establishment of Mobile Police and Military units in Kafanchan and Birnin Gwari for quick response to security challenges ,_,  while they appealed to government at all levels to improve on security agencies' capabilities in handling crisis by providing adequate logistics ._. The peace agreement reads in part :_:  There is need also for joint community policing ,_,  comprising all ethnic groups to complement the efforts of security agencies ._. 
Government should complete the gazetting of all existing grazing reserve ,_,  stock routes and provide them with complete facilities ._. 
The Pastoralists should be encouraged to adopt modern animal husbandry techniques in place of roaming about with their livestock ._. 
All grazing reserves that have been encroached should be reclaimed while compensation should be paid to the original land owners where this has not been done ._. 
Proliferation of small and medium arms should be seriously checked ._. 
Creation of the ministry of Animal Resourcfes out of the present Ministry of Agriculture is highly recommended ._. 
There is also the need to implement the recommendations of all previous committees established by Kaduna state government on peace and reconciliation ._. 
The youths should be sensitized on the need for self -_: restraint and not to talk laws into their hands ._. 
All outstanding issues with respect to boundary disputes with neigbouring states should be resolved by the relevant government agencies ._. That MACBAN and SOKAPU hereby jointly declare that membership of the two associations should be open to all indigenes of southern Kaduna subject to compliance with their appropriate constitutional provisions ._. 
We recommend that perpetrators of this dastardly act must be arrested and brought to justice ._. 
The Print ,_,  electronic and social media should desist from making sensational unfounded reporting on crisis situations ._. 
We therefore call on all relevant regulatory bodies to sanction such erring media houses and practitioners ._. 
Also leaders of the various communities should henceforth desist from making inflammatory statements ._. 
Finally ,_,  we call on all our people to embrace peace ._. However ,_,  while these decisions were being taken ,_,  a coalition of civil society organisations in the southern part of Kaduna State at a news conference insisted that those behind the massacre of their people must be identified by security agencies to face the law ._. The spokesman for the coalition ,_,  Mr ._. 
Zakari Sogfa accused the state government of inaction towards stopping the killings ._. 
They warned that the recent killing of about 130 people in Bondong district of Kaura Local Government Area of the state by the Fulani herdsmen would be the last act of genocide against their kinsmen ._. They alleged further that even in situations where the communities captured the perpetrators of the heinous act and handed them over to the security forces ,_,  none have been prosecuted in court to serve as deterrence ._. The group noted that on several occasions when the attacks occurred ,_,  the government was always quick to condemn it ,_,  promising that everything was being done to handle the security situation after which a few items of relief are sent to the victims ,_,  but only for the attacks to continue ._. Sogfa said it was curious that while the governors of other states like Plateau ,_,  Benue ,_,  Nasarawa ,_,  Kogi and Taraba who are affected by the violence ,_,  have met to discuss the challenge ,_,  the Kaduna State governor was conspicuously absent from that meeting ,_,  in spite of the fact that the larger part of his state ,_,  is worst affected by the violence ._. The response of government to the killings has been rather very lackadaisical and merely palliative ,_,  without any concrete efforts or measures to forestall future attacks or apprehend the attackers and bring them to justice ._. If anybody thinks that we are playing politics over with our lives ,_,  lands ,_,  heritage ,_,  and survival ,_,  it is that person that is playing politics ,_,  because that person is trying to shift responsibility to avoid doing the right thing ,_,  the group said ._. 
The group alleged that their key stakeholders  -_:  the traditional rulers ,_,  and community leaders waited for several hours at the State House ,_,  Kawo ,_,  venue for the meeting ,_,  but the committee did not come and they had to leave out of frustration ._. Somebody would now come up and say they held a meeting and that SOKAPU president was there ,_,  and the Fulani were there ._. 
Are they telling us that the Fulani that were there ,_,  who purportedly signed a cease fire ,_,  have agreed that they are the ones that have been killing our peopleIf they agreed that they are the ones killing our people ,_,  did they explain why they are doing so ,_,  because we have never attacked them ._. 
When the government says 'warring' parties ,_,  that is not true ._. 
There is nothing like warring parties ._. 
We are not at war with the Fulanis ._. 
The Fulanis are the ones at war with us ._. 
Therefore ,_,  the question of signing any 'ceasefire' does not arise ._. 
It is just another round of politics as far as we are concern ._. 
You don't call a whole community of people and their respectable first -_: class chiefs to a meeting and keep them waiting for hours ._. If anybody says he has signed a peace document ,_,  in as much as we desire peace ,_,  we don't believe in what they signed ._. 
Now ,_,  if the Fulanis that purportedly signed such a document agreed that they have been attacking our people ,_,  then we demand that government should start taking legal proceedings immediately by arresting and prosecuting those that killed our defenceless men ,_,  women ,_,  and children in their hundreds ._. Where were the IGP and the DIG when our people were being killed So this issue is beyond anybody coming to Kaduna and getting people to signed document ,_,  to say that we have achieved peace in Kaduna ._. 
We are still feeling very vulnerable ,_,  and this has not given us any assurance for safety ,_,  Sogfa said ._. But Zuokumor in his reaction to the allegations made by the group denied keeping anybody waiting for hours ._. 
He said that his committee had to see the governor first before the commencement of the meeting with the stakeholders ._. He said that all the traditional rulers attended the meeting ,_,  arguing that if anybody left because he was being delayed ,_,  such people were not genuinely out to make peace ._. We were meeting the governor and the people had to wait for us until after our meeting with the governor ._. 
The traditional ruler who we did not expect to attend the meeting waited because they were determined to make sure they have peace ._. 
So if one or two young men who came and decided to leave in anger because they were impatient ,_,  means that they were not ready to discuss peace ._. Whenever there are hostilities against each other ,_,  not everybody would want to make peace ._. 
Some people don't want peace ,_,  so if they are telling you something else ,_,  it means they don't want peace the DIG said ._. According to him ,_,  the Fulani herdsmen had wanted to meet leaders of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union SOKAPU and the SOKAPU leaders too had wanted to meet the leaders of the Fulani herdsmen ._. 
So our coming together was a big relief for the two groups ._. They all came together and they agreed ,_,  we decided to give them time to deliberate among themselves ._. 
They came up with a document to tell the world that they are no longer fighting each other and anybody who does anything that is detrimental to peace ,_,  will be tantamount to a criminal act ._. Observers have however expressed reservations about the peace agreements ._. 
They are concerned about its potency to bring lasting peace without the perpetrators of the killings facing the law ._.

Ademola -_: Olateju believes that following the deadly bombing in Abuja Monday ,_,  Nigerians must begin to police and protect themselves against Boko Haram ._. My Twitter feed went bat shit crazy through the American night ._. 
When the notifications became unbearable ,_,  I was forced to check ._. 
The screaming headlines on Premium Times was unmistakable  -_:  Over 200 feared dead as explosion rocks Nigerian capital ,_,  Abuja !_. 
I went back to my Twitter feed and was confronted with retweets of presidential cutthroat Reuben Abati's tweets ._. 
His handle @abati1990 tweeted President Jonathan saddened by loss of lives in Nyanya bombing ._. 
And in another tweet President Jonathan has ordered heightened security in Abuja following Nyanya bombing ._. Is that all The president is always saddened by each act of terror but what has he done The state of emergency he ordered did not work ._. 
The entire Northeast is a lawless jungle ._. 
The anomie is spreading southwards ,_,  Abuja is threatened ._. 
What and where nextFor readers who are uninterested in official lies and cover ups; Nyanya ,_,  is a surburb of Abuja after Asokoro ._. 
It is nearer the city than Kubwa and Lugbe and about five minutes drive from Mogadishu barracks that was bombed a while back ._. 
Nyanya under bridge is the most populated place in Abuja per square metre every workday of the week during early morning rush hour and at the close of business ._. Since small buses were banned by current minister of the Federal Capital TerritoryFCT ,_,  Bala Mohammed ,_,  workers from Karu ,_,  Jikwoyi ,_,  Maraba ,_,  Masaka ,_,  Ado and even Keffi in neighbouring Nasarawa State congregate at the bridge ._. 
Small commuter buses bearing passengers from these suburbs drop them off at the bridge ,_,  so they can board the bigger El -_: Rufai buses going into the city ._. Nyanya is also the gateway to places outside Abuja where people can board interstate commercial vehicles ._. 
The under bridge houses a thriving daily market that fuels the population throughout the day even though the real market is on Wednesdays ._. 
It is only an unthinking and insensitive government that cannot anticipate this scale of terror on a prime target in a densely populated area in the FCT ._. After the attack on the Alfred P ._. 
Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19 ,_,  1995 by Timothy McVeigh ,_,  all federal structures within the United States became heavily fortified till date ._. 
The Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people and injured more than 680 ._. 
Until the September 11 ,_,  2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center ,_,  the Oklahoma City bombing remained the most destructive act of terrorism committed on United States soil ._. 
At the time ,_,  the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces of over 665 rescue workers to assist in the rescue and recovery operations ._. 
Why has Nigeria refused to learn from other countries on how they have reacted swiftly against terror Why are law enforcement always caught napping The death toll escalates daily ,_,  whyOnline ,_,  there were pictures of victims from the explosion dumped like rotten garbage inside dump trucks ._. 
One dead man was carted in a wheelbarrow !_. 
Why are we like this Why are we so inhuman Why are we the way we are How did we get here When will we evolve enough to earn the noun Human ._. 
Is it too much to ask that National Emergency Management AgencyNEMA provide body bags at times of rescue and recovery like this The body of these victims deserve better ._. 
The gory pictures we saw had the dignity of yams and farm produce ._. 
There was no dignity befitting human beings in the transportation of the dead at the scene ._. 
For all we care ,_,  body bags must have been included in the budget of these agencies for emergencies like this ._. 
It is possible they have body bags but someone may have sold it to morgues and private hospitals or pocketed the allotted money ._. 
What kind of country are we in We don't even have ordinary level decency The federal government spends a lot of money every year training personnel abroad ._. 
Has the training been utilized at times like this Bless the memory of these victims oh Lord and give succor to their families ._. From eyewitness account ,_,  a golf car must have been used in this attack to house the bomb before it was detonated ._. 
The way our law enforcement agencies are configured ,_,  the bodies will be collected ,_,  the wounded will be taken to hospital and the trail will go cold without investigation until the next attack ._. 
Within 90 minutes of the explosion in Oklahoma City ,_,  Timothy McVeigh was stopped by an Oklahoma State trooper for driving without a license plate and arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon ._. 
Forensic evidence linked him to the attack by a nation whose agents are alert to their duties and with tools to aid them ._. In Nigeria ,_,  evidence will either be ignored or tampered with ._. 
We know ,_,  all these bombs will have some kind of signature ,_,  but unique identifiers are only useful when law enforcement are interested in investigating what happened ,_,  how it happened ,_,  where the materials came from ,_,  who bought them ,_,  and so on ._. 
The humongous security vote is just going into private pockets ._. 
I suspect those who benefit may never want the gravy train to stop ._. 
On the flip side ,_,  one ,_,  just one of Diezani jets can equip the Nigerian police to fight terror but our political Mafiosi will rather buy bullet proof cars and Gulfstream jets than secure its citizens ._. The country including those who think they are immune to terror are riding a tiger ._. 
Our home grown terror groups are major threats to our peace and security and they undermine a united Nigeria ._. 
The plain truth is that the devastating human cost of terrorism ,_,  in terms of lives lost and lives permanently altered is ginormous ._. 
Those who can make a difference are choosing not to care but they too will pay the price sometime ._. 
The ultimate aim of these terror groups is to destabilize Nigeria and undermine its economic and social development ,_,  the beneficiaries of insecurity will soon learn that they are not immune ._. I admit ,_,  confronting this threat is difficult given the complex and asymmetrical nature of terrorism but the president must begin to do more than issue halfhearted statements ._. 
The United States moved decisively against terror after the September 11 terror attack ._. 
That move gave rise to unprecedented security at the airports ,_,  the patriot act etc ._.  What is this president waiting for Why is security still lax at high value targets Our borders are still porous as ever ,_,  our airports are still laid bare for attacks ._. 
The whole country is a costly joke !_. 
What have we to show for the high security budget of the last two years We have seen from the Nyanya bombing that the motivations ,_,  financing ,_,  methods of attack and choice of target are constantly changing ._. 
Why are we not seen strong coordination and cooperation between the states and with other countries to effectively combat this threat There is already a legal framework of 18 universal legal instruments against terrorism ._. 
Why are we not comparing notes and learning from best practices and lessons learned from other nations to assist with the investigation and prosecution of terrorists How are we fighting the triumvirate of drugs ,_,  transnational organized crime and money -_: laundering that feeds terrorismThe sight of the incinerated buses should leave no one in doubt that the death toll is higher than official figures ._. 
We are used to it ,_,  we are completely desensitized to human suffering and needless deaths ._. 
To us ,_,  no matter the number of deaths ,_,  life must go on and it will go on in the most dastardly form; we skip over the bodies our very own ._. 
Years of military rule has decimated our humanity ._. 
Nothing shocks us anymore ._. 
We walk by dead bodies without blinking except for the stench that offends us ._. 
Bodies are routinely mangled by motorists on the highway until it flattens out on the asphalt ._. 
Ritualist are routinely paraded with human body parts ,_,  shrines have become slabs for human slaughter ._. Yet ,_,  this President lives beyond action and reason ._. 
He does not seem understand nor care about the costs of terror on the citizenry and the cost is mounting unfortunately ._. 
Perhaps ,_,  the time is ripe to police ourselves ._. 
We as citizens need to be more aware and vigilant ._. 
Vigilance is key in combating terrorism ._. 
As citizens ,_,  we should watch out for any person or persons wearing clothes with protruding bulges or exposed wires under clothing ,_,  people or cars emitting strange chemical odors ,_,  be on the alert and observe any person murmuring as if saying a prayer in crowded places ,_,  or anyone who pushes to gain a position amid a crowd or near an important person ._. 
Suicide bombers often do not maintain eye contact ,_,  they sweat profusely ,_,  exhibit excessive hand movements ,_,  bite their nails and chew the inside of the mouth ._. These are signs you must look for in people as you frequent densely populated public places ._. 
Be alert and be aware of your surroundings ._. 
Citizen action can help prevent attacks from happening ._. 
We must begin to protect ourselves since nothing agitates this president except the 2015 elections ._. 
I urge you to do your part in saving Nigeria ._. 
Those who have worked in conflict zones believe we will hit rock bottom before we can have sanity in this land ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  rock bottom is the pits of hell littered with human remains !_. 
Goodluck Nigeria !_.

Abuja � In the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack on the Nigerian capital since an insurgency began in 2009 ,_,  survivors say they escaped with their lives but lost everything else ._. 
Officials say they are looking at ways to help the bombing victims and boosting security ahead of the World Economic Forum for Africa to be held in Nigeria next month ._. At this Abuja hospital ,_,  some bomb blast victims moan softly ,_,  but most sleep ._. 
They've lost limbs and been burnt ._. Evere Ivbezim ,_,  a fruit seller ,_,  had her jaw nearly knocked off by the blast that hit Monday as she was boarding a bus ,_,  killing 71 people and injuring at least 124 others ._.

Everything ._. 
I no get anything ._. 
Only my life ,_,  thank God ._. 
Thank God for that ,_,  may government help us ,_,  said Ivbezim ._. Outside the hospital ,_,  Beni Lar ,_,  the chair of the Committee on Human Rights in the National Assembly ,_,  says many victims of the bombing were working -_: class people ,_,  barely scraping by in Abuja's satellite towns ._. The satellite towns are where civil servants and other employees of Nigeria's pristine capital live ,_,  because they can't afford to stay in the city ._. 
The towns are notorious for lacking electricity ,_,  clean water and for bad roads ._. Lar says the government should find a way to help the blast victims recover economically ._. Those that have lost their breadwinners and their families ,_,  they will need some relief and some economic reintegration to the families of the victims ,_,  said Lar ._. Emergency management officials say they will be paying the hospital bills but have not determined if there will be any other form of compensation ._. The director general of Abuja's FCT Emergency Management Agency ,_,  Abbas Idriss ,_,  says the government is working to coordinate hospital responses to mitigate the suffering of any future attacks ._. But Monday's attack  -_:  the first in two years in the capital  -_:  was so devastating that authorites don't have enough room for the bodies ._. The situation is that it's not really accommodating the victims ._. 
That is why we have to look for alternative places to relocate all the corpses ,_,  said Idriss ._. Idriss also says the local government is increasing security ahead of the World Economic Forum for Africa next month ._. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack but analysts blame Boko Haram ,_,  an Islamist militant group that has killed thousands of people ,_,  saying it wants to enforce its harsh version of Islamic law ._. Most of the violence has been in the northeast ,_,  where three states have been under emergency rule for nearly a year ._. 
Nigeria's military says it has largely contained the group ,_,  reclaiming formerly occupied lands ,_,  arresting and killing insurgents and scattering many who escaped ._. But large -_: scale ,_,  deadly attacks continue ,_,  and rights groups say more than 1 ,_, 500 people have been killed this year alone ._. And at the Nyanya Motor Park hours after the attack ,_,  Vera Achoin ,_,  a local English teacher ,_,  points to dozens of bombed -_: out city buses and says she fears the conflict is spreading ._.

The drivers ,_,  the one that survived you see them swimming in blood ,_,  said Achoin ._. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps says it will deploy 100 ,_, 000 extra security guards on the roads and around churches for the upcoming Easter holiday ._. Boko Haram has threatened Christians and previously attacked churches on Christian holidays ._. 
However ,_,  the vast majority of its victims have been Muslims ._.

The Borno State government had recently closed all secondary schools in the state after security report indicated that Boko Haram fighters are perfecting plans to attack them ._. However ,_,  final year students were directed to report in some schools in Maiduguri and Biu to write their exams ._. 
Barely 16 hours after a bomb explosion at a bus park in Nyanya ,_,  a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory FCT ,_,  killed scores of people and injured so many others ,_,  129 female students were abducted on Monday night by members of the terrorist group Boko Haram from Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok in Borno State ._. The news of their abduction came just as the federal government confirmed that the death toll from the Nyanya bus park tragedy had risen to 75 ,_,  while the number of those injured from the incident was put at 140 ._. But some progress may have been made to unravel the culprits behind the bus station attack ,_,  as THISDAY was reliably informed by sources in the Counter -_: Terrorism Unit CTU of the security agencies that their operatives may have identified and recovered the body of the suspected bomber who detonated the bomb at the Nyanya bus park ._. The secondary school girls ,_,  who were abducted by members of Boko Haram ,_,  were among the 250 boarders at the government secondary school and were sitting for the ongoing WAEC/SSCE when they were forcibly taken away from the school on Monday night ._. 
The incident occurred about three weeks after the Borno State Government had closed down all public schools to avert further attacks on students ._. 
The terrorist group had attacked many schools in the North -_: east ,_,  killing scores of students and the teaching staff ._. However ,_,  it was gathered that the female students were asked to return to school to write their final year secondary school exams that was supposed to commence this week ._. Confirming their abduction ,_,  the Defence Headquarters DHQ said 129 girls were kidnapped by members of the sect from the school ._. 
The Director of Defence Information DDI ,_,  Maj -_: Gen ._. 
Chris Olukolade ,_,  in response to THISDAY enquiries yesterday ,_,  said 129 students were present at the time of the attack ,_,  and not the 200 girls who were reported to have been abducted ._. Olukolade also disclosed that some of the girls managed to escape and had since regained their freedom from the abductors ._. 
He said :_:  A group of terrorists yesterday night attacked Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ._. About 129 students in the school at the time of the attack were said to have been abducted but some of them actually succeeded in escaping from their abductors ._. The defence spokesman also stated that the military was still on a search -_: and -_: rescue mission trailing the terrorists ._. 
He assured Nigerians that the abductors were being tracked and cornered within the environment with the help of the locals ._. 
The sect ,_,  according to other sources ,_,  had attacked Chibok ,_,  a town said to be 141 kilometres from Maiduguri ,_,  the Borno State capital ,_,  at about 10 pm ,_,  burning down houses and shops at will ._. They were also alleged to have carted away food items and vehicles and killed an undisclosed number of people in the town ._. 
The insurgents ,_,  who were said to have had a field day during the raid ,_,  then went to the all -_: female boarding school and abducted over 100 students who were lodged in the hostels for their final examination ._. According to a resident of the town who preferred not to be named ,_,  the attackers ,_,  who came in large numbers ,_,  attacked the community and several houses were razed ._. He revealed that the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  was also attacked and over 100 students of the school writing their senior secondary school certificate examination were abducted by the attackers ._. Another resident of the town ,_,  Amos Ahmadu ,_,  who spoke on the phone to journalists in Maiduguri ,_,  said the attackers collected large amounts of food items from residents before fleeing the community ,_,  which they set ablaze ._. It was also gathered that many residents of the town fled into the bushes ,_,  while others have relocated to neighbouring Damboa ._. 
When contacted ,_,  the Borno State Commissioner of Police ,_,  Alhaji Lawan Tanko ,_,  said he heard about the incident and had deployed his men to the area ._. He however said he could not volunteer further details ._. 
Also ,_,  the federal government yesterday said contrary to earlier speculations that the total number of victims affected by the Nyanya bomb blast was 236 ,_,  the correct figure is 215 ,_,  of which 75 persons were recorded to have died ._. Speaking to journalists at the end of a tour of four major hospitals in Abuja ,_,  where injured victims are receiving treatment ,_,  the Minister of Health ,_,  Prof ._.  Onyebuchi Chukwu ,_,  said :_:  When we released the figures yesterday ,_,  we made it clear that it was provisional ._. It took us quite a long time as you are aware for us to even release provisional figures ,_,  but finally late last evening when we released those figures ,_,  we still issued a caveat that they are provisional because sometimes there may be double counting and sometimes there might be people who were not counted ._. Chukwu added :_:  Having taken everybody into consideration ,_,  including the movement of people ,_,  what we have now is that those who have been evacuated and captured in hospitals is a total of 215 victims ,_,  but out of the 215 ,_,  75 are dead ._. 
So that is the current figure ._. Also speaking against the backdrop of several complaints regarding the difficulties associated with identifying the dead bodies by relatives ,_,  the minister said :_:  The pathologists are working hard on that ._. 
When you have pieces of flesh and bones here and there ,_,  they need to be properly sorted out ._. 
Sometimes it is not as easy as people may think ._. So as at this time ,_,  I may not be able to give this information ._. 
By the time the pathologists are through ,_,  obviously we may have to revise the mortality figure ._. 
So I plead with you to be patient and let's do it properly ._. When asked if the continuous attacks by Boko Haram had not overstretched health care services and facilities ,_,  Chukwu gave the assurance that government had ensured that cases of trauma emanating from acts of terrorism were quickly dealt with ._. He said :_:  We have been doing things as government to also increase the capacity for trauma ._. 
As you are aware ,_,  the additional trauma facility at the hospital was ready and even used yesterday ._. 
But it will be properly commissioned in the next few days ._. However ,_,  the minister's statement on the number of casualties from the Nyanya bus park bomb blast conflicted with the figure released by the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA yesterday ._. While giving an update on the bomb incident to journalists in his office in Abuja ,_,  the Director -_: General of NEMA ,_,  Alhaji Muhammed Sani -_: Sidi ,_,  said blood was urgently needed for the treatment of the wounded victims and urged Nigerians to visit the various hospitals where the victims were hospitalised to donate blood ._. He said the agency had received a report confirming that one of the victims died at the Asokoro Hospital ,_,  thus bringing the number of death to 72 ._. Sani -_: Sidi said the president had during his sympathy visit to the victims of the bomb blast directed the agency to collaborate with the Federal Ministry of Health and hospitals' management to ensure the speedy recovery of injured victims and to take care of the bills ._. 
He said NEMA had visited all the hospitals to ascertain the state of the victims ,_,  adding that appropriate arrangements were being made by the hospitals and other relevant organisations to help families who had lost loved ones to claim their remains ._. Speaking on measures being taken to assist in identifying families of those who died in the blast ,_,  Sani -_: Sidi said NEMA had opened an information desk at its headquarters that would be working 24 hours a day to attend to any complaints or enquiries from affected families ._. He explained that arrangements were also being made to conduct DNA tests to identify some of the dead persons ._. 
According to him ,_,  due to the timely intervention of rescue personnel ,_,  this led to a reduction of the casualties ,_,  adding that reports available to NEMA from various hospitals showed that many of the victims were recovering fast ._. Meanwhile ,_,  a breakthrough may have been made by security forces in their effort to uncover the culprits behind the Nyanya bus park bomb blast ,_,  as THISDAY has learnt that the CTU in the presidency may have identified and recovered the body of the suspected bomber ._. Information made available to THISDAY from security sources confirmed that the slightly charred body of the bomber was identified and recovered yesterday with the charms and amulets he must have used for self -_: protection ,_,  still strapped to his body ._. 
The charms and amulets are typical of the type used by members of Boko Haram ._. According to security sources ,_,  certain leads ,_,  including a mobile phone that may have been used to detonate the bomb ,_,  were also recovered from his body ._. Also ,_,  security forces informed THISDAY that they are working on two leads as to how the bomber planted and detonated the bomb :_:  the first is that the bomber may have driven a bomb -_: laden red Volkswagen Golf car to the bus park and walked away before the explosion ._. 
The second is that the suspected bomber may have walked into the bus park with the bomb concealed in a large jute bag popularly known in Nigeria as Ghana -_: must -_: go bags ,_,  which was dropped close to the commuter buses ._. Either way ,_,  security forces said the suspected bomber ,_,  having conveyed the bomb to its destination ,_,  walked away to a location at the bus park ,_,  where he ostensibly waited for the bomb to explode ._. But unknown to him ,_,  he did not give enough distance between himself and his deadly parcel and like other innocent Nigerians that he had set out to kill ,_,  was also killed by the impact of the explosion ._. One security official explained that the fact that his body was not dismembered or charred beyond recognition like others who were killed instantly by the blast ,_,  might have stemmed from the fact that he was not as close to the epicentre of the explosion as the commuters who had boarded buses at the park ._. 
The Ijaw Youth Council IYC has asked the federal government to take drastic action against members of the Boko Haram terrorist group and their sponsors ._. The IYC in a statement Tuesday by its spokesman ,_,  Mr ._. 
Eric Omare ,_,  said the problem of terrorism could not be resolved without tackling the promoters ._. According to him ,_,  considering the deadly nature of attack and the implication on our national security ,_,  the IYC calls on the Federal Government of Nigeria to take drastic and far -_: reaching steps against sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria ._. Sponsors of Boko Haram should be arrested and made to face the full wrath of the law ._.

We commend the efforts of security agencies in tackling the challenge of terrorism and once again state our call for the extension of the existing state of emergency in the North -_: east of Nigeria ._. 
The Nyanya attack has shown that Boko Haram has an agenda to extend its activities to other parts of the country once they are successful in overrunning the North -_: east ,_,  the group added ._. 
President Goodluck Jonathan has insisted that no matter the evil machinations of terrorists ,_,  his government will continue to deliver democracy dividends to Nigerians ._. He equally assured Nigerians and the international community that activities of terrorists would soon be a thing of the past ._. 
His commitment to stamp out terrorism came on the heels of a similar pledge made by the World Economic Forum WEF to go ahead with plans for its Africa summit scheduled to take place in Abuja next month despite the bomb attack on the Nyanya bus park that killed 75 people ._. Jonathan ,_,  who spoke at the Peoples Democratic Party PDP unity rally in Kano State yesterday ,_,  once again conveyed his condolences to the families of bomb blast victims from the Nyanya attack ._.

Let me emphasise that terror will not stop Nigeria from moving ._. 
The terrorists and those sponsoring them will not stop this country from moving ._. This country will continue to move from strength to strength ._. 
We will continue to do our best to make sure we live peacefully in this country ,_,  Jonathan said ._. 
The president described Shekarau as a good man and a man of the people ,_,  urging party members to continue to support ,_,  project and follow him ._. Shekarau is a man of the people ,_,  a man Kano people should follow ,_,  a true Nigerian ._. 
I thank Shekarau for joining the PDP today and he is fully welcome ,_,  the president added ._. 
In his remarks ,_,  Shekarau said the unity rally organised to welcome him to PDP was an occasion for democracy and an occasion for choice ._. He told the president that the return of key former members of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party ANPP and later APC was to show solidarity and loyalty to his government ,_,  promising to continue to be loyal to the party and his administration ._. 
Mr ._. 
President ,_,  I wish to pledge my commitment and that of other members who made the choice to join the PDP with me ,_,  Shekarau said ._. He pledged his commitment to work with the president in order to realise the objectives of the PDP ._. 
He thanked Jonathan for the various federal projects that had been completed and were ongoing in Kano State ._. 
He said he would continue to re -_: dedicate his life to the service of the people ,_,  just as he urged Jonathan to do more for the people of Kano by way of empowerment ,_,  especially by boosting agriculture ._. Meanwhile ,_,  WEF yesterday said its Africa summit would be held in Abuja next month despite a bomb attack on the outskirts of the city that killed scores of people ._. The bombing blamed on Boko Haram terrorists targeted morning commuters at the Nyanya bus terminal ,_,  south of the city -_: centre and was the deadliest attack ever in Abuja ._. These tragic events will not stop us from delivering on our promise to host a world -_: class meeting next month ,_,  the forum said in a statement that was quoted by AFP ._. Abuja has hosted a number a high -_: profile international events ,_,  including West African and African Union summits ,_,  but the WEF conference has been described as the most prestigious meet to come to the nation's capital ._. The forum said it was putting in place unprecedented security measures to protect delegates in Abuja ._. 
Our security planning for the World Economic Forum on Africa is already well under way and will be the largest security operation ever mounted in this country for an international summit ,_,  the body said in the statement ._. In total ,_,  over six thousand security personnel ,_,  consisting of police and army will be deployed ,_,  covering a secure area of 250 square kilometres ,_,  it added ._. 
The Nigeria police have beefed up security across the capital following Monday's attack and have pledged to intensify surveillance at all vulnerable targets ._. The summit is set to be held at a number of hotels and venues in heavily -_: guarded central Abuja from May 7 to May 9 ._. 
Also ,_,  the federal government yesterday reassured Nigerians and the international community that Monday's act of terrorism in Nyanya ,_,  would not cast a spell on the forthcoming WEF in Abuja ._. In a joint statement by the Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Minister of Finance ,_,  Dr ._.  Ngozi Okonjo -_: Iweala who is the Co -_: Chair ,_,  WEFA Nigeria 2014 Steering Committee and Dr ._.  Nwanze Okidegbe ,_,  Chief Economic Adviser to the President and Co -_: Chair ,_,  WEFA Nigeria 2014 Steering Committee ,_,  the federal government stated that security agencies were currently in the middle of a thorough and robust investigation to ensure perpetrators of the blast are brought to justice ._.

Lagos � AN international humanitarian relief and development organisation said the Abuja bomb blast that killed scores of people was a sign of an escalating local �war� ._. Conscience International's sentiments come amid the heightening of terror attacks ,_,  the latest leaving more than 70 dead after a blast in Nyanya in the outskirts of the capital ._. The blast has been blamed on the militant Boko Haram sect ._. �With the April 14 blast in Abuja that killed 71 civilians ,_,  Nigeria's war with Boko Haram terrorists is obviously heating up ._. It appears that ,_,  following President Goodluck Jonathan's recent order for 5 ,_, 000 troops to move into the area with large numbers of checkpoints ,_,  Boko Haram has shifted its attacks to the capital of Abuja ._. James Jennings ,_,  President of Conscience International ,_,  stated ._. �Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa ,_,  with the largest economy and two insurgency movements ._. 
Although the long -_: running insurgency in the northeast has been neglected by most Western media ,_,  three states there have become incredibly vicious killing fields ._. �Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe are worst affected by the terror blamed on the Boko Haram ._. Jennings said a Conscience International medical team was in Nigeria during an attack that killed 70 unarmed villagers in Borno and Benue last month ._. �That massacre followed an earlier attack on three villages in Kaduna March 14 that left 119 dead and 250 houses burned ._. 
After interviewing wounded victims of some of the attacks ,_,  our response is to increase medical aid and begin building houses for some of the thousands of displaced villagers ._. �United States -_: based Conscience International is a humanitarian relief and development organization that implements life -_: saving medical interventions ,_,  refugee assistance ,_,  and community development programs following wars and natural disasters ._. 
For two days running ,_,  delegates to the National Conference were engulfed in a stormy session over the state of insecurity in the country ,_,  with some of them calling for the suspension of the conference until there is improvement in security ._. The delegates were worried by Monday's bombing in Nyanya ,_,  a suburb of the Federal Capital TerritoryFCT that claimed over 72 lives and injured over 124 others ,_,  and the abduction of 129 pupils from Girls' Secondary School in Chibok ,_,  Borno State by insurgents believed to be members of the outlawed Boko Haram sect ._.

He suggested that the National Conference be put on hold and a delegation sent to meet with President Goodluck Jonathan for an assurance on the safety of the delegates ._. Alternatively ,_,  he said the conference should be suspended until an improvement in the security situation in the country ._. Bakare explained that it would not be fair for the delegates to continue with their assignment when the country is in a severe state of insecurity ._. If we need to bring the conference to a halt in order to get the message across to the authorities that serious actions must be taken to arrest the killings ,_,  so be it ,_,  he added ._. 
A former governor of Ogun State ,_,  Chief Olusegun Osoba ,_,  in his contribution ,_,  suggested that a delegation of the conference should visit the president to make a case for the closure of Nigeria's borders with Cameroun ,_,  Niger and Chad ._. A former Minister of Communication ,_,  General Tanko Ayuba ,_,  condemned insecurity in the country ,_,  saying :_:  To me ,_,  it appears there is a system failure on the part of government and on the part of the armed forces ._. There is no coordination or proper intelligence gathering ._. 
There is need for a total overhaul of the entire security system; there is also a need to ask the armed forces whether they have been infiltrated and are being internally sabotaged or if they are poorly motivated ,_,  he added ._.

Lewthwaite ,_,  also known as Sherafiyah Lewthwaite ,_,  is the widow of 7/7 suicide bomber Germaine Lindsay and one of the world's most wanted terrorism suspects ._. On Monday ,_,  a huge explosion ripped through a busy bus station in the capital ,_,  Abuja ,_,  during the peak rush hour ._. 
The enormous blast destroyed 40 buses and left a sickening trail of death and destruction as fuel tanks on nearby vehicles also exploded amid the heat of the blast ._. According to Daily Star ,_,  while nobody has officially claimed responsibility ,_,  security sources fear the bombing may have been a revenge attack for the death of al -_: Shabaab terror chief Makaburi ,_,  aka Sheikh Abubakar Shariff Ahmed  -_:  Lewthwaite's mentor  -_:  just two weeks ago ._. Lewthwaite is an alleged member of the Somali radical Islamic militant group Al -_: Shabaab ._. 
She has been accused of orchestrating grenade attacks at non -_: Muslim places of worship ,_,  and is believed to have been behind an attack on those watching football in a bar in Mombasa during Euro 2012 ._. The infamous widow of 7/7 bomber ,_,  Lindsay ,_,  is on the run in Africa with three children ._. 
The daughter of a British Army soldier ,_,  she is already on Interpol's Most Wanted list in connection with seven murders as well as the siege of the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi ,_,  Kenya ,_,  in September last year which left 67 dead and nearly 200 injured ._.

The world's most wanted woman was reportedly caught at a checkpoint in Nigeria just six months ago  -_:  but managed to bribe her way to freedom ._.

Together ,_,  the groups control a vast ,_,  arid area known as Sahelistan  -_:  thousands of miles of sub -_: Saharan land which stretches from Senegal in West Africa to Somalia in the east ._. This ungovernable terrain has become a sanctuary for Islamist militants plotting atrocities in Africa and across the world ._. 
The commander of the U ._. S ._.  military's Africa Command General Carter Ham said the groups now share money ,_,  explosives and even train together ._. He said :_:  Each of those three organisations is by itself a dangerous and worrisome threat ._. 
What really concerns me is that they are coordinating and synchronising their efforts ._. 
That is a real problem for us and for African security in general ._. The White Widow ,_,  who has been on the run since January 2012 ,_,  got her grim nickname after husband Lindsay blew up a London Tube train in the 7/7 bombings in 2005 ._. 
Fifty -_: six people were killed and more than 700 injured ._. 
Interpol has issued a rare 'Red Notice' for the White Widow's arrest ._. Lewthwaite ,_,  from Aylesbury ,_,  Buckinghamshire ,_,  is believed to have widely used the alias Natalie Webb and travelled on a forged South African passport ._.

Police seized her laptop in 2011 and found detailed plans of how to build bombs and evidence she was planning multiple terrorist attacks both in Africa and the West ._. She has also been linked to grenade attacks at non -_: Muslim places of worship in Africa and a terrorist attack on western football fans watching Euro 2012 in the Jericho bar in Mombasa ._. Head of Interpol Ronald Noble said :_:  There is a global 'tripwire' for this fugitive ._. 
All 190 member countries are aware of the danger posed by this woman ,_,  not just across the region but also worldwide ._.

Many more were injured in the attack ._. This is very inhumane ,_,  ungodly and barbaric ._. 
I don't even have the adjectives to describe what these mad people have done ,_,  Mr ._. 
Oritsejafor said in a statement on Tuesday ._. As far as I am concerned ,_,  the perpetrators are not human beings and in my own opinion ,_,  when they finally die their corpses should be given to pigs because they are on the same level with pigs ,_,  he said ._. Sympathising with families who lost their loved ones in the attack ,_,  Mr ._. 
Oritsejafor called on security agencies to fish out their colleagues who could be sabotaging their efforts ._. There are people within the security agencies that sympathize with this madness ._. 
As they discover them ,_,  they should be exposed and dismissed from the service ,_,  he added ._. The cleric also condemned anyone providing funds for the terrorist ._. As the judgment of God comes upon them the terrorists ,_,  the judgment of God will also come on those who are sponsoring them ,_,  he said ._. 
Anybody who has given N1 :_: 00 One Naira to these people ,_,  whether they are local people or foreign financiers ,_,  the same judgment will come upon them and their children ._. 
They will not escape it ._. 
So those are my words ._.

Another resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity also said :_:  Seven of my children including those of my elder brother and sister who are writing the SSCE in the affected school are still missing ,_,  and I don't know whether they were abducted or among those who escaped into the bush ._. However ,_,  the PPRO who spoke on the issue said :_:  Yes ,_,  there was an attack in Chibok ,_,  yesterday evening by suspected members of Boko Haram terrorists ,_,  but we are yet to get details ._. 
As soon as details of the attack reach my table ,_,  I will get back to you ._. 
Despite the slow pace of business activities in the first quarter ,_,  huge investments by multinationals companies and the rise in Nigeria's Gross Domestic Product GDP show positive prospect for marketing communication practitioners in the months ahead ._. 
Raheem Akingbolu reportsMarketing practitioners across various sectoral bodies entered this year with great expectation ._. 
With the reform in the advertising industry taking shape and the 2015 election gathering momentum ,_,  stakeholders in the industry foresee a robust business opportunity for practitioners in the coming months ._. 
Public Relations practitioners ,_,  outdoor agencies and experiential marketers ,_,  all prepared for juicy accounts ._. 
With the ad reform crossing the first hurdle of popular acceptability ,_,  its proponents believed it would advance the fortune of the industry ._. APCON Chairman ,_,  Lolu Akinwumi ,_,  told THISDAY early this year that the year would be better in terms of performance as agencies will take advantage of the reform ._. 
He also pointed out that the sector might witness merger of one or two agencies ._. 
On how public sector would influence activities in the industry in 2014 ,_,  Akinwumi said government policies would encourage spending and that the preparation for 2015 will attract additional spending ._. Prospects But nearly four months into the year ,_,  nothing much has changed in terms of volume of business done by agencies ._. 
However ,_,  there are some activities in the market that give positive signal that the coming months would bring good fortune ._. 
One ,_,  the stability in government has continued to attract further investment ,_,  the recent being the Procter & Gamble's $250 million investment in a new plant site at the Agbara Industrial Estate in Ogun state ._. 
Also ,_,  the news of Nigeria's GDP that rose to $510 billion following the reclassification of the base year of the GDP from 1990 to 2010 would also serve as a booster for further economic activities ._. 
The development saw the size of the Nigeria's economy appreciated by 11 steps to become the 26th largest economy in the world ahead of South Africa's ,_,  which has held sway as the continent's largest economy for some time ._. Aside P&G ,_,  THISDAY investigations early in the week revealed that major multinationals in Nigeria have concluded plans to invest more in the market ._. 
According to a credible source ,_,  Unilever Nigeria Limited ,_,  PZ Cussons ,_,  Promasidor and Nestle Nigeria Plc have jacked up their investments in preparation for more marketing activities ._. 
Not only that these companies plan to introduce new products into the market ,_,  they were said to have used the last three months to finalise possibilities of increasing production to meet the increasing demand in the market ._. Marketing ActivitiesAlready ,_,  Promasidor and Nestle have started rolling out their plans to raise the stake in the next few months ._. 
Promasidor ,_,  makers of Cowbell Milk ,_,  last month launched Onga cubes into the seasoning market following a successful penetration of Onga powder ,_,  which was introduced into the market in 2004 ._. 
Speaking at the launch of the new product in Lagos ,_,  Executive Director ,_,  Commercial of Promasidor ,_,  Mr ._. 
Kachi Onubogu ,_,  said the decision was taken after almost two years of insightful and innovative work by the Promasidor team ._. Similarly ,_,  Nestle ,_,  last week rolled -_: out the drum to celebrate the launch of its Maggi Chicken ._. 
The Nigerian seasoning brand launched their new flavor at a fun event where consumers were assured of better things to come ._. 
Expectedly ,_,  the two events attracted huge advertising ,_,  experiential and PR supports ._. Also last month ,_,  Nigerian Breweries repackaged Legend Extra Stout and gave it a similar treat to appeal to consumers ._. 
The brand now appears a new look of Staniol cover and metalised labels with the Monde seal of quality embossed on the new appearance ._. At the Eko Atlantic ,_,  Lagos ,_,  where the unveiling ceremony took place ,_,  its promoters did the unusual by riding on music ,_,  theatrics and comedy to connect consumers ._. 
The event ,_,  which was put together by Oracle Experience Limited ,_,  explored core experiential marketing techniques to bond with new consumers and give existing ones fresh excitements about the brand ._. Guinness had towards the end of last year ,_,  done the same when it changed the look of its Premium brand  -_: Guinness Extra Stout ._. 
To push the new look ,_,  the company explored social media ,_,  advertising ,_,  experiential and public relations to woo consumers ._. 
The re -_: launch ,_,  which began towards the end of last year dovetailed into the New Year ._. 
It was done in a unique way to connect with consumers across the market segment ._. 
Aside traditional advertising support ,_,  it was showcased very conspicuously on the social media ._. 
Before then ,_,  a build up to the launch came through a teaser; 'Have you been Tagged ._. ColourfulWorldOfMore ._. 
Then came the supper concert that heralded it; it was done in a unique way ._. 
All these were done to carry patrons along and they were handled by top marketing communications agencies in the country ._. New Development ,_,  Challenges To compliment the growth in the online media ,_,  a new survey has shown that daily time spent on mobile devices is now outpacing TV in the U ._. S ._.  for the first time ._. 
According to a newly -_: released 2014 AdReaction study from Millward Brown ,_,  Americans now spend 151 minutes per day on smartphones ,_,  next to 147 in front of TVs ._. 
The research agency found that the numbers are even greater elsewhere ._. 
In China ,_,  consumers are said to be spending as much as 170 minutes a day on smartphones ,_,  nearly double their TV watching time ._. Users in Indonesia ,_,  the Philippines ,_,  Brazil and Vietnam are also said to be spending more total screen minutes on average than the U ._. S ._.  ,_,  predominately on mobile ._. 
The firm claimed to have surveyed more than 12 ,_, 000 mobile users ,_,  between the ages of 16 and 44 ,_,  in 30 different countries ,_,  polling consumption of ads over TVs ,_,  laptops ,_,  smartphones and tablets ._. Despite the positive development in the industry ,_,  crises in some countries are slowing down businesses ,_,  especially for experiential marketing companies that need to interface with consumers to do their businesses ._. 
For instance ,_,  in the northern Nigerian ,_,  activities of the insurgent group  -_: Boko Haram has made it extremely difficult for outdoor practitioners and experiential agencies to thrive their businesses in some states ._. 
To a large extent ,_,  this has denied practitioners in this area the opportunity to enjoy from the largess coming from the market ._. 
Unidentified gunmen have kidnapped at least 100 girls from a school in northeastern Nigeria ._. Witnesses say the mass abduction took place after assailants attacked the town of Chibok in Borno state late on Monday ._. A local resident tells VOA that the assailants burned houses ,_,  offices and the local Government Girls Secondary School before packing the students into a hijacked truck and driving away ._. Initial reports said around 200 girls were abducted ._. 
A reporter for VOA in the area ,_,  Abdulkareem Haruna ,_,  says local sources tell him some of the girls were able to escape ._. Haruna says the gunmen and security forces engaged in a shootout in which one soldier and one police officer were killed ._. State police commissioner Alhaji Lawan Tanko confirmed the incident to reporters and said his officers are on the trail of the abductors ._. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack or the kidnapping ._. 
The assault is similar to others carried out by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram ,_,  which is blamed for scores of attacks and thousands of deaths since launching an insurgency in 2009 ._. The group ,_,  whose name means Western education is a sin ,_,  wants to impose strict Islamic law on northern Nigeria ._. Borno is one of three states where the government declared a state of emergency last May ._. 
Nigeria's military has since launched operations meant to crush Boko Haram ,_,  but large -_: scale attacks have continued ._. 
While attacks by the militant group Boko Haram have killed many people in northern Nigeria ,_,  communal violence is also taking a toll ._. 
The group Human Rights Watch saID since December more than one thousand people have been killed in five northern states ._. HRW researcher Mausi Segun said that communal violence is a common occurrence ._. The violence has been almost on a daily basis in some places like Benue State and in a few other places you've had it almost on a weekly basis ._. Speaking from the capital Abuja ,_,  Segun said communal violence has gone on for years in northern Nigeria ._. 
But she warned it's now spreading ._. A lot of it we have been able to trace to tensions between the pastoralist herdsmen ,_,  who are nomadic ,_,  and farmers who find that their farmlands and their crops have been destroyed by the cattle of the herdsmen ._. 
And then you'll have the herdsmen ,_,  on the other hand ,_,  also complaining about killing of the cattle ,_,  which are really a prized treasure to them ,_,  she said ._. Segun said that violence begets violence in northern Nigeria ._. There might be revenge killings very soon because we can sense the frustration of the people that there is no justice ._. 
There is no accountability for any of these attacks ._. 
These are very vicious crimes that have taken place ._. 
People have lost their family members ,_,  their limbs and property ._. Human Rights Watch agreed there is little government follow -_: up ._. Segun said ,_,  Not in any of these attacks has there been any open or comprehensive investigation of those who are responsible for the attacks ._. 
We have spoken to scores of people ,_,  who have been victims of these attacks and the recurring story is that no one from the security agencies  -_:  neither from the police  -_:  nor from the military  -_:  has been there to take notes and to hear from them what they saw ._. She said there may be a link between some of the communal violence and the militant group Boko Haram ._. Some of the victims that we've spoken to have talked about seeing individuals who they claim may not be the same herdsmen that they're used to in their environment ._. 
They seem to be foreign to them ._. 
And so there seems to be some mercenary work going on as well ._. 
But there really isn't much to be said on the part of the government to take steps to put all of this in check ,_,  she said ._. A few weeks ago ,_,  the Nigerian military announced that forces had been deployed to some of the areas hardest hit by the violence  -_:  particularly ,_,  Benue ,_,  Nasarawa and Plateau States ._. Unfortunately ,_,  a couple of days after that there was an attack ,_,  which has been blamed on security forces in Keana town against the Fulani community in which at least 30 people are said to have died ._. 
I've spoken to victims of that attack and they confirm that these are military authorities ._. 
The authorities have said they are investigating that attack ,_,  she said ._. Human Rights Watch has made a number of recommendations to quell the communal violence in northern Nigeria ._. 
These include establishing clear boundaries for cattle routes and grazing areas  -_:  setting -_: up mediation between farmers and herders on recognizing each others rights  -_:  and ensuring that those believed responsible for mass killings are promptly investigated by specially trained police and then prosecuted ._. The group said that the lack of justice for years of violence ._.  has created a combustible situation ._. 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has condemned the Nyanya bomb attack and offers continued UK support for Nigeria ._. A statement issued by the British High Commission in Abuja quoted Hague as saying ,_,  I was deeply saddened to hear of the bomb explosion in the east of Abuja ._. 
I unreservedly condemn those responsible and hope they are swiftly brought to justice ._. I offer the British government's deepest condolences to the bereaved and those who have suffered injury ._. 
We will continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to help them tackle the threat from terrorism ._. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office FCO has however reviewed its travel advise to its nationals ._. Also ,_,  the Foreign Affairs Minister of Canada ,_,  John Baird ,_,  in a statement said Canada condemns in the strongest possible terms this cowardly terrorist attack during rush hour at a busy bus station in Abuja ._. Such brutal acts of terror cannot be allowed to go unpunished ._. 
Canada reaffirms its support to Nigeria as it combats terrorism ._. Spain also condemned the series of terrorist attacks by the Boko Haram group ._. 
The statement from its government conveyed condolences to the families of the victims and to the Nigerian authorities ._. The country therefore reiterated its solidarity and closeness to Nigeria and promised continue to cooperate in the fight against the Boko Haram terrorism ,_,  which has claimed so many victims ,_,  it said ._. 
When Oyebuchi Chigozie arrived the Nyanya motor park at about 6 ._. 00 a ._. m ._.  on Monday ,_,  he thought his daily routine would continue ._. 
He would board a bus from the park to Garki ,_,  Area 11 to resume sales at his electronics shop ._. Over 30 minutes after he arrived at the park ,_,  Mr ._. 
Chigozie found himself at the Nyanya General hospital ,_,  trying to recollect how he got there ._. I was dumfounded at where I saw myself ,_,  the trader told PREMIUM TIMES on his hospital bed ._. 
In fact I was so confused that I can't still explain how it happened ._. I just dropped at Nyanya from Lafia where I stay and I entered into the garage to buy the ticket so I can get into the bus and head for work ._. I was so close to the bus but not inside the bus and the next thing I heard was a loud sound and I knew I was lifted from the ground and landed on the other side of the garage and then I found myself at the hospital ._. Mr ._. 
Chigozie is one of the 124 people that the Nigerian government said were injured after a bomb explosion at the motor park in Nyanya on Monday morning ._. 
At least 71 others were not as lucky as they died from the blast ._. The trader said the momentary heat he felt all over his body when the explosion happened was so hot that he felt he was going to explode just before he landed on the floor ._. I was surprised when I woke up and I saw myself on the hospital bed with plasters and bandages on my right leg and left arm ,_,  I feel so much pain round my arm and leg ,_,  he said ._. Nyanya Motor Park is located in the Abuja suburb ,_,  about 30 minutes' drive from the city centre ._. Every day ,_,  thousands of people who leave in Nyanya ,_,  Karu ,_,  and other Abuja suburbs board public and private buses and cars from the park to their work places at the city centre ._. 
The park also serves as a workplace for hawkers of different age groups who sell various products like confectioneries ,_,  sachet water ,_,  books ,_,  wrist watches ,_,  and others ._. Other occupants of the park include the bus drivers ,_,  ticket vendors ,_,  and beggars ._. Onyebuchi Chigozie a victim of the Nyanya bomb blast recieving treatment at the Nyanya general hospitalJust like Mr ._. 
Chigozie ,_,  Issac Okafor also arrived the Nyanya park with intention of boarding a bus to Wuse Market ,_,  where he sells clothes ._. At about 6 ._. 00 a ._. m ._.  ,_,  I was just at the entrance of park ,_,  I have not even gone into the park when I heard a loud sound that made me feel my ears were about pulling out ,_,  Mr ._. 
Okafor told PREMIUM TIMES on his hospital bed ._. My feet were off the ground ,_,  in the next minute I landed on the ground again ._. 
For a minute ,_,  I lost my breath ._. 
I found it so hard to breathe before I was rushed to the hospital ._. As I landed on the floor with my back ,_,  I felt like I was choking ,_,  I could not breathe properly ,_,  it was as if I was struggling to breathe ,_,  I felt this sharp pain just in my chest just before I was brought to the hospital ._. 
The doctors that attended to me injected me and gave me pain killers which I think has helped my breath well ,_,  he said ._. Mr ._. 
Okafor said he lost his phone and all valuables during the blast and has not been able to contact his family ._. Messrs Chigozie and Okafor are among the 11 victims of the blast brought to Nyanya General Hospital ,_,  the Medical Director ,_,  Frank Idegwe ,_,  told PREMIUM TIMES ._. He said all the patients are currently responding to treatment and eight of them have been discharged from the hospital ._. As at yesterday Monday we had about 11 of them who were on admission and under observation ._. Over the night we were able to discharge eight of them and we have just three left ._. 
But out of the three ,_,  there is one we are still reviewing to see maybe we can take him to a consultant ophthalmologist because he is complaining of seeing double ,_,  Mr ._. 
Idegwe said ._. The patient who complained of 'seeing double' declined to speak to PREMIUM TIMES ._. Mr ._. 
Idegwe said the hospital was facing no challenges and had ensured adequate treatment for all the patients ._. 
He also confirmed the federal government's earlier statement that no fee was collected from any of the patients ._. 
The government had announced that it would take care of the cost of treatment of all the victims of the blast ._. The explosion has been condemned by Nigerian leaders ,_,  politicians ,_,  religious leaders and international agencies and governments ._. Though no group has claimed responsibility for the blast ,_,  the Boko Haram terrorist group has carried out similar attacks in the past and had ,_,  earlier in the year ,_,  threatened renewed attacks on the Nigerian capital ._. 
When Shuaibu Abukabar arrived Nyanya Motor Park early Monday ,_,  his plan was to travel to Suleja to purchase new wares for his shop as he does bi -_: weekly ._. But 15 minutes after paying for a ticket and taking a spot on a long queue of passengers ,_,  a deafening blast threw him off the ground ,_,  set off a huge fire and left bodies of injured and the dead littered around him ._. 
In three minutes ,_,  Mr ._. 
Abubakar recalled ,_,  everything seemed quiet as a thick dark smoke curled into the morning air ._. At first there was quietness and suddenly I saw smoke and fire ,_,  then I passed out ,_,  Mr ._. 
Abubakar narrated from the hospital where rescuers rushed him to ._. He said he was thought to have died and was hauled alongside mangled bodies ,_,  but was later confirmed to be alive ._. After I fainted only to open my eyes and tried to turn only to find myself inside a truck with dismembered bodies ,_,  they noticed me and later removed me when they realized that I am still alive ,_,  he said ._. 
As I am talking to you now ,_,  there is so much noise inside my head ,_,  I cannot move my legs ,_,  the doctors attended to me ,_,  gave me drips and medicine ._. Official statistics puts the number of the dead from Monday's explosion at the crowded Nyanya park at 75 ._. 
But a PREMIUM TIMES reporter who arrived the scene minutes after the incident insists the casualty figure was much higher ._. Mr ._. 
Abubakar was one of the 124 injured survivors ._. 
President Goodluck Jonathan blamed the extremist group Boko Haram for the explosion ._. At the Maitama hospital where Mr ._. 
Abubakar was being treated Tuesday ,_,  he said he had to endure not only pains but the pangs of hunger ._. He had ,_,  on the day of the incident ,_,  missed breakfast ,_,  having left so early ,_,  and throughout Monday ,_,  ate nothing ._. 
The hospital provided nothing and he remained hungry until Tuesday morning when reporters visited the hospital ._. I did not eat anything I was too weak to eat but at midnight I couldn't sleep of hunger ,_,  the last time I ate was on Sunday evening ,_,  but there was no food provision ._. 
Some people from the mosque came here to give me bread and tea this morning ,_,  the hospital only gave us injections and drips ._. 
I am still hungry ,_,  broke and with no money ._. Salome Jim ,_,  a bus ticket vendor ,_,  was among those who also survived the attack ._. 
The force of the blast hurled her to a nearby rock and ,_,  fortunate to escape the death that surrounded her ,_,  she sustained a fracture ._. I was selling tickets to passengers when I heard a loud bang and I saw myself flying in the air ,_,  I landed on a stone ,_,  got up to run when I felt a sharp pain in my legs ,_,  she said from her hospital bed ._. Ms ._. 
Jim said she mustered strength to crawl on her buttock to safety ._. 
My leg broke into two like a broom ,_,  she said ._. Lying next to her was Isah ,_,  an okada rider well known within the park ._. Isah too was badly injured ,_,  I saw his intestines coming out from his stomach ,_,  and the rescue team covered him up and packed the things back into his body that was the last time saw him ,_,  she said ._. I have been sitting down here waiting for a surgery ,_,  I am in pain ,_,  I am very hungry ._. 
No one has come here to give me food ,_,  I can neither walk nor move ,_,  the nurses and doctors are nice to me but they didn't give me food ._. The nurse said she will come and attend to me at 9 :_: 30 am this morning and this is 9 o' clock so I am waiting ,_,  but when I came here yesterday they took care of me ,_,  I didn't pay for anything ,_,  but they didn't give us food ,_,  she narrated ._. I went to bed with an empty stomach ,_,  the woman inside the ward over there she pointed shared her food with me at midnight ,_,  as I am here my relatives didn't know I am here as I couldn't find my phone ._. A staff of the hospital who pleaded anonymity told PREMIUM TIMES that some cannot eat due to their medical conditions but those that can eat should be given food ._. Some of the victims cannot eat just yet ,_,  but some of them who can eat do not have the money to eat ,_,  the government can't only be administering drugs on empty stomachs it can lead to other serious cases ,_,  we all tried yesterday but not even a single word of commendations from the government ._. 
You people should let Nigerians know the bomb blast victims are hungry and are not fed ,_,  the official said ._. When asked why the victims had not been fed ,_,  health minister ,_,  Onyebuchi Chukwu ,_,  who visited the hospital early Tuesday did not give a direct response ._. He said :_:  The management of the hospitals will go back after my departure to find the true situation and sort it out ,_,  all hospitals have been very cooperative this is the main situation ._. The Federal Capital health secretary ,_,  Onoke Emaiye ,_,  who accompanied the minister admitted it was the responsibility of the government to feed victims of the blast ._. The Federal government and FCT administration are responsible for their feeding and their medical bills ,_,  some have been taken to the theatre ,_,  some Intensive Care Unit ,_,  some are been given blood ,_,  he said ._. 
Nigerians have reacted with outrage over President Goodluck Jonathan's visit to Kano to welcome former governor of the state ,_,  Ibrahim Shekarau ,_,  to the Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  a day after over 200 Nigerians were killed and several others were injured in a bomb blast in a suburb of Abuja ._. Insensitive ,_,  irresponsible ,_,  terrible ,_,  and wicked are some of the words that have been used to describe the president's political visit to Kano ._. Let's face it ,_,  is it even proper ,_,  as a father ,_,  for the president to be dancing at a rally and clinking glasses at a chief's party just the day after said Betty Abah ,_,  journalist and activist ._. 
What really would happen if he sends representatives while he pretends he's meeting security chiefs Even if he doesn't care ,_,  is this even good for his image What message is he sending out He did same during the Centenary celebrations ._. 
How do you explain this crass insensitivityIt is plain insensitive ,_,  really ._. 
It an evident that the leadership of this country does not take our lives seriously at all ,_,  said activist lawyer ,_,  Bamidele Aturu ._. Over 200 people were killed by Boko Haram insurgents ._. 
Less than 24 hours later ,_,  the president was in Kano on political mission ._. 
That tells you they don't take us seriously and our lives don't count for much ._. 
That is the height of insensitivity I have seen in recent times ,_,  he continued ._. He wouldn't have lost anything if he had postponed the campaign for another one or two months and let the people who are bereaved come to terms with the gruesome reality ,_,  he added ._. Mr ._. 
Aturu said the President's action showed the huge disconnect between Nigerians and their political leaders ._. Our people need to understand that there is a big disconnect between them and the people that leads them who only require them to vote to be in power ._. He said the president's action ,_,  if done in other countries ,_,  could have cost him his job ._. This kind of things would not happen elsewhere ._. 
In other countries the president can even be impeached for what he has done ._. 
It is terrible ._. 
For him to embark on that trip show clearly that for him politics is more important than the lives of Nigerians ._. It is very insensitive and irresponsible ,_,  said another lawyer ,_,  Festus Keyamo ._. That is a sign that the government does not value the lives of Nigerians ._. 
As a matter of fact it is confirmation that the present system actually enjoys the pogrom that is going on in that part of the country ._. 
It is very condemnable that the president could not even declare a day of national mourning after we have lost about 200 lives ,_,  said Chairman of CACOL ,_,  Debo Adeniran ._. The president is not thoughtful; the president seems to be sadistic ,_,  enjoying the show of bloodletting ._. 
Our president doesn't care ._. 
You know he said the other time that he doesn't give a damn ._. 
He doesn't give a damn whatever Nigerians say ,_,  he doesn't give a damn about our feelings of agony ,_,  he doesn't give a damn about those who are suffering the pains and pangs of the carnage going on in some parts of the country ._. The Governor of Kano State ,_,  Rabiu Kwankwaso ,_,  also chided the president for being insensitive to the lives lost in he blast ._. At a time when several innocent lives have been lost ,_,  when many of the victims are in hospital seeking blood donations to survive ,_,  the president is gallivanting around the country in the name of PDP unity rally ,_,  he said during the matriculation ceremony of the Northwest University ._. PREMIUM TIMES columnist ,_,  Pius Adesanmi ,_,  was sarcastic in his condemnation of the president's political rally in Kano ._. Writing on his Facebook timeline ,_,  Mr Adesanmi ,_,  who is a professor of English at Carleton University in Canada ,_,  said :_: People can tell lies sha ._. 
They are saying that a day after terrorists struck his country's capital in an attack that killed and maimed hundreds of his employers and on the same day that Boko Haram kidnapped two hundred school girls ,_,  all daughters of his employers ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan was on the campaign trail in Kano ._. The people telling these horrendous lies against my President might as well go ahead and say that Dr Jonathan's pals ,_,  Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela ,_,  would do likewise in similar circumstances ,_,  bringing out the fatted calf to make campaign merry just after losing hundreds of Americans or South Africans ._. 
Even my eyes ,_,  watching TV ,_,  are part of this conspiracy of lies against the President ._. 
Twitter is in on the conspiracy too ,_,  telling lies that Reuben Abati has twitted triumphant pictures of the President's triumphal entry to Kano ,_,  he wrote ._. I am sure that what Mr ._. 
President did today was embark on a sweeping working visit to military and other security formations all over the North to boost morale ,_,  listen to the needs and challenges of our men and women in uniform ,_,  and use the carnage in Abuja to sensitize them to the fierce urgency of the task at hand ._. I am sure that my President continued the task of mending the traumatized psyche of his people today ._. 
I am sure that my President and his handlers cannot be dumb enough to miss the symbolic significance of the nation seeing images of him hands -_: on on the security front  -_:  and definitely not on the political front of self perpetuation in office  -_:  a day after Abuja ._. 
So ,_,  my eyes ,_,  TV stations ,_,  Twitter ,_,  and all other conspirators ,_,  stop telling lies against my President ._. 
If you saw anybody campaigning in Kano today ,_,  wasn't him ._. 
It was Shaggy !_. Crocodile tearsMr Adeniran said the president was merely shedding crocodile tears at the scene of the carnage on Monday ._. It was crocodile tears he shed ._. 
He visited just because it happened in Abuja close to Asokoro ._. 
He wouldn't have visited; he didn't visit Maiduguri ,_,  he didn't visit several other sites of pogrom ._. 
He only managed to make out time for that because he was in Abuja when that happened ._. 
It wasn't that he was concerned about the lives and properties damaged ._. Similarly ,_,  Mr ._. 
Keyamo said the president was only pretending with the emotions he displayed after he visited the scene of the blast hours later ._. It is just pretence ,_,  nothing but pretence ._. 
We ought to declare clear seven days of mourning for those victims ._. 
No political activities should take place with those seven days ,_,  He said ._. On his part ,_,  Mr Aturu said the president was only playacting like a professional mourner would do ._. Politicians can playact ._. 
You know in Nigeria there are people that are paid to weep at funerals ceremonies ._. 
What he has done clearly shows that he didn't believe what he was doing ._. If he was weeping just yesterday and now he's in Kano doing politics when people are yet to come to terms with what happened ._. 
All they want is power that's the impression they are giving unfortunately ._. 
The Nigeria Labour Congress NLC and the Head of Service of the Federation have expressed shock over the bomb blast that claimed the lives of passengers in Nyanya ,_,  a suburb of Abuja on Monday ._. In separate statements yesterday ,_,  the President of NLC Abdulwaheed Omar and the HOS Alhaji Bukar Goni Aji condemned the attack and assured that the welfare of victims and families of the deceased would be catered for ._. Omar called on the federal government to implement the recommendations of the two committees it set up on Boko Haram and to prosecute their sponsors ._. He wondered why despite the huge funds put into security ,_,  it has not translated to better infrastructure ,_,  training and incentive for personnel ._. 
While bemoaning the death of civil servants in the blast ,_,  Goni Aji assured the wounded and families of the deceased civil servants of efforts to facilitate all arrangements for the burial and payment of entitlements to the families of deceased officers in line with civil service regulations ._. Also ,_,  the Trade Union Congress TUC called on the federal government to confront terrorism in the country head on ._. In a statement by Bobboi Bala Kaigama and Musa Lawal ,_,  the president and secretary respectively ,_,  the congress called for collaboration among all the security agencies and friendly nations to defeat the scourge ._. To all intents and purposes the insurgents have declared war on the nation ,_,  and there is no reason why they should not be viewed and treated in that light ,_,  it said ._. 
Gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram militants on Monday night abducted about 200 teenage girls from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok ,_,  Borno State ._. The gunmen arrived in many vehicles ,_,  and packed the students in a bus and pick -_: up trucks ._. 
Hundreds of students were in the school when the insurgents struck ,_,  and nearly all of them were taken ,_,  according to a girl who escaped and a father of a missing student ._. Some of those taken fell off moving vehicles while others fled after the vehicle they were being taken in broke down ._. Sources said the Boko Haram insurgents disguised as soldiers and told the students they were there to evacuate them because of a threat of attack ._. They gathered the students and told them that there was a threat from Boko Haram on imminent attack on the school ,_,  one source said ._. They told the girls that they would be evacuated to a safe place so that they would not be kidnapped ,_,  and the vulnerable girls were convinced ._. However ,_,  while they were being taken away ,_,  they sensed danger from the utterances and body language of the terrorists ._. 
That was when some of them jumped out of the lorry which was going deep into the bush ._. Most of the abducted girls are between the ages of 16 and 18 ,_,  Daily Trust learnt ._. Daily Trust learnt also that insurgents in their dozens ,_,  armed with guns and rocket -_: propelled grenades ,_,  attacked Chibok town itself where they burnt many houses ,_,  shops and vehicles ._. A soldier and a policeman were reportedly shot dead by the insurgents ._. One of the girls who escaped recounted her experience in a BBC Hausa radio interview ._. 
She said one of the cars broke down and the insurgents set it ablaze and transferred us to another car ,_,  carrying food items ,_,  some to a car that carried petrol ,_,  and others were put in an empty bus ._. 
Some of them escorted us on motorbikes ._. After we passed three villages in the forest ,_,  one of the cars stopped in the forest ._. 
Some of them and those on the motorbikes went back to fix the car ,_,  but our car went ahead ._. Upon seeing that ,_,  some girls close to the door dropped out of the car and run into the bush ._. 
We also followed them into the bush ,_,  where we stayed till the following morning before we headed back to our homes ._. A man ,_,  who said his daughter is among those taken ,_,  also spoke to BBC Hausa radio ,_,  saying more than 300 girls were abducted and only a few of them escaped ._. In fact all those SS 3 students writing their final year examination of WAEC have been abducted ._. 
Only few of them thrown out of the cars managed to escape ._. 
But all the rest have been abducted ._. When I personally followed up the route ,_,  I found two girls thrown away from the cars ._. 
This yesterday's morning around 9am ,_,  I reached one village along the way ,_,  where they warned me not to proceed because they told me Boko Haram members were just nearby ._. Ismaila Musa ,_,  a school teacher from Chibok ,_,  told journalists in Maiduguri that the lorry used in abducting the girls was initially loaded with grains but was snatched from the driver who was passing through the area ._. This is the first major attack on Chibok town ,_,  even though many communities around it have been sacked ._. 
The town is the headquarters of Chibok Local Government Area ,_,  and is situated about 130 kilometers south -_: west of Maiduguri ._. 'Troops in pursuit'The Borno State government is yet to give a statement on the abduction ,_,  but some officials said Governor Kashim Shettima was shocked and short of words ._. State Education Commissioner Malam Inuwa Kubo could not be reached for comments ._. Police Commissioner Lawan Tanko confirmed that there was an incident in Chibok ,_,  but said they were still compiling details of what happened ._. Yes ,_,  there was an attack in Chibok but we are yet to have details ,_,  he said ._. When contacted ,_,  the Director of Defence Information ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade ,_,  said ,_,  A group of terrorists yesterday night attacked Government Girls Secondary School Chibok ._. 
About 129 students in the school at the time of the attack are said to have been abducted but some of them actually succeeded in escaping from the abductors ._. 
Troops are still on search and rescue mission trailing the terrorists ._. Daily Trust reports that girls and women had been taken by insurgents in the past ,_,  but this is the first time that such numbers would be taken at a time since the insurgency began years ago ._. During their attack on the Federal Government College Buni Yadi in Yobe State in February ,_,  insurgents had killed many male students but told the female students to go home and get married ._. In his most recent video ,_,  Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau had threatened persistent attacks on educational institutions ,_,  insisting that Western education is forbidden ._. The abducted girls were writing their final -_: year senior secondary school certificate examinations ._. A top security source said authorities at GGSS Chibok directed the girls to go and write their exams without adequate clearance from security agencies ._. The truck that was conveying the girls broke down in the bush before it reached its destination ._. 
We are now trying to locate where the girls were taken to ,_,  he said ._. A resident of Chibok ,_,  Lydia Ibrahim ,_,  confirmed to our correspondent on phone that three of her cousins writing SSCE at the school were among those kidnapped ._. We have been looking for them since the time we heard of the incident but there is no information ._. 
We are all worried about their safety because these are innocent girls ,_,  she said ._. How some escapedA parent of one of the abducted girls said about 20 of them jumped out of the moving truck without the knowledge of the abductors ._. My daughter is not that lucky but other girls hung unto branches of trees as the truck passed through the bush ._. 
They came down from the trees when the convoy of the terrorists left and found their way back to Chibok and other villages ,_,  she said ._. The abduction was carried out weeks after the Borno State government closed all secondary schools in the state after security reports indicated that Boko Haram fighters were planning to attack institutions ._. However ,_,  final -_: year students were asked to report in some schools in Maiduguri and Biu to write their exams ._. A cleric ,_,  Usman Malam Usman ,_,  said the abduction of nearly 200 girls at a time is the height of impunity ._. We have a different kind of terrorism here and only God can save us ._. 
I doubt much if there is anywhere in the world ,_,  no matter how lawless the place is ,_,  where 200 girls would be abducted without a trace ._. 
Only God knows what would happen to them ,_,  he said ._. Anger at FGMeanwhile ,_,  residents of Maiduguri have expressed anger over what they called nonchalant attitude of the Federal Government towards the security challenges in Borno and Yobe states ._. James Manassa ,_,  a civil servant in Maiduguri ,_,  said there is grand conspiracy to ground social and economic development in the two states that have been the centre of insurgency in the last five years ._. Yes ,_,  there is state of emergency on ground but we are all aware that the Federal Government has deliberately refused to release fighting equipment for the soldiers on ground ._. Sambisa forest is in Borno State and not in the moon but the soldiers could not get into it because they have inferior weapons while our people are dying every day ._. 
Now our daughters have been abducted and the perpetrators would go free ,_,  he said ._. Khalil Sule ,_,  a retired military officer ,_,  alleged that most of the equipment deployed to fight terrorism in the Northeast are obsolete ._. Most of the armoured tankers ,_,  the RPGs and AK -_: 47 rifles are not serviceable and that is why the soldiers are running away from battle grounds ._. 
The terrorists are not far and everybody knows that they can be done with in less than one week if there is the seriousness ,_,  he said ._. Hamza Idris ,_,  Yahaya Ibrahim ,_,  Ronald Mutum and Ibrahim Kabiru Sule
With the not -_: so -_: impressive one year of emergency rule in the three states of Adamawa ,_,  Yobe and Borno ,_,  another extension may be counter -_: productive ._. The soldiers were first invited to countermand the Boko Haram insurgents when they took Maiduguri hostage in 2009 ._. 
And everything stood still for about five days ._. 
Indeed ,_,  they uprooted the sect and in the process ,_,  killed their leader ,_,  Mamman Yusuf and a few others ._. 
Maiduguri ,_,  or rather Borno or simply put the entire nation was relieved ._. 
As the nation celebrated a year anniversary of its victory on the war against terror ,_,  the anti -_: social group made a surprising reappearance under a new leader ._. With a guerrilla combat style ,_,  the terrorist group has continued to have a field day ._. 
But the government has asked that the group comes to a roundtable for discussion ,_,  a suggestion often mocked by the sect ._. 
Government had deployed force unsuccessfully and as such ,_,  pondered dialogue ._. Against this backdrop ,_,  the federal government slammed emergency rule on the three states of Yobe ,_,  Adamawa and Borno ,_,  which unfortunately has not yielded result ._. 
Sadly ,_,  government is making effort to extend the emergency rule even when there is no evidence in sight that the last six months nay a year has recorded any significant success ._. Instead ,_,  the attacks have become more vicious ,_,  and the terrorist siege gradually extending beyond the boundary of the North -_: east zone ._. 
What started in Borno has grown to become a Northeastern problem ,_,  and later a Northern problem and may soon become a national crisis ._. When the military was asked to put a stop to the crisis in the early days of Governor Kashim Shettima's reign in Borno ,_,  the soldiers were not received in good faith ._. 
They were seen as agents of occupation and accused of many crimes ._. 
But Shettima defended them ._. Before the coming of the soldiers ,_,  the level of insecurity and fear in the state was so glaring ,_,  people were even afraid to walk down the street ._. 
The soldiers were brought in to maintain calm and order and protect the lives and properties of the citizens with no intent of denigrating the eminent personalities that were actually advocating for the removal of the soldiers ._. The question is simple ,_,  what is the credible alternative to the withdrawal of the troop ._. 
If anyone can offer us a sustainable and tenable solution to the security vacuum that will be created if the soldiers have to leave the state ,_,  we are willing to accept it but no one has yet offered a solution ._. 
We must treat this issue with care ,_,  devoid of emotion ._. 
The soldiers are not from Borno and will be glad to go to their homes and get united with their families ._. 
This issue ,_,  we must try as much as possible not to politicize ,_,  he said ._. That was two years ago ._. 
But the governor recently defended the military ,_,  when it was alleged that some soldiers were collaborating with the insurgents and could be responsible for the protracted crisis ._. 
Shettima described it as unfair ,_,  unhealthy and dangerous to the continued unity and well being of the nation ._. 
He argued that this will only add to undermine every Nigerian that supposedly should be in arms against the insurgents ._. But the question many are asking is that if the military was actually cleared of complicity ,_,  why has the insurgency thrived and who is benefitting from the state of emergency rule and is it not time for it to be terminated since election approaches ._. 
There are indications in the three states that the insurgency has not reduced ._. 
Perhaps ,_,  what the military has achieved is pushing the insurgents from the state capitals to the bushes and has protected those in the towns at the detriment of rural dwellers and travelers on the highways ._. They have continued to kill on a daily basis ,_,  especially in Borno ,_,  apart from a few towns where most settlements have no life ._. 
And with no clear cut success recorded ,_,  many are wondering if it is right for the president to seek an extension of the emergency rule ,_,  especially that he was advised against it six months early ._. The Yobe State Governor ,_,  Alhaji Ibrahim Gaidam ,_,  once told the president that it was needless ,_,  shortly before Jonathan was allowed the six months period that will be running out this week ._. 
He had alleged that the federal government did not do enough in the last six months to bring normalcy back in the three states ._. 
His position was hinged on the fact that an extension without necessary machinery on the ground will be tantamount to motion without movement ._. The statement issued by the governor's media aide ,_,  Alhaji Abdullahi Bego ,_,  said though the president was acting in accordance with the power given to him by the constitution ,_,  the reason he supported him when the emergency rule was declared ._. Over the past six months ,_,  however ,_,  the efficacy of emergency rule has been demonstrably checkered ._. 
While the military and other security agencies on the ground have done and continued to do a commendable job in very difficult circumstances ,_,  insurgents and criminals are still able to carry out heinous and despicable attacks on innocent people ._. We still remember and mourn the innocent victims of attacks on our schools in Damaturu ,_,  Mamudo and Gujba towns ._. 
We cannot forget scores of other innocent victims who were killed ,_,  maimed or deprived of livelihoods by criminals and insurgents who have not a speck of respect or feeling for human life ._. 
And our people still continue to endure hardships as a result of the prevailing security situation ._. The governor's submission was supported by the Borno State Commissioner of Justice and Attorney -_: General ,_,  Kaka Lawan Shehu ,_,  who admitted that issue of security was covered by the exclusive legislative list which gives the federal government the exclusive right to make laws on it ._. 
It is a no -_: go -_: area for the state to legislate on ._. He explained that the federal government which had earlier declared emergency rule in 15 local government areas of Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa ,_,  in May 2013 slammed curfew on the entire Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa States for the first six months ,_,  which it renewed around November for another six months ._. He therefore noted that the extension of emergency rule will serve no purpose as the military and the civilian populace in the affected states are collaborating to bring the insecurity situation to an end ._. Lawan urged the federal government to encourage the three states by devising another strategy to managing the crisis outside the emergency rule ._. More so as the state governments of Borno ,_,  Adamawa and Yobe notwithstanding the fact that security is covered under the exclusive legislative list of the constitution ,_,  they have contributed greatly in motivating the military and security agencies with provision of logistics with a view to bringing the insurgency in this area to a standstill in addition to similar support ,_,  especially in Borno ,_,  extended to youth vanguards popularly called Civilian JTF ._. In a nutshell ,_,  it is not in the interest of the government to extend the emergency rule beyond this present six months that will be expiring in a few days time ._. A House of Representatives member representing Gulani/Damaturu/Gujba/Tarmuwa Federal Constituency ,_,  Hon ._. 
Khadija Bukar Abba -_: Ibrahim ,_,  also called for the replacement of the Joint Task Force Operations with the emergency rule currently running in the three North eastern states ._. She thought the insurgency could be contained by a joint task force security operation ,_,  insisting that extending the emergency rule billed to expire on April 19 is not the best ._. Personally ,_,  I think we need to have all the help that we need to curb the insurgency ._. 
You don't have to impose a state of emergency ._. 
You can actually put in place a joint task force within the state without actually saying there must be an emergency rule ._. 
I think that is a possibility ._. 
So ,_,  I don't see any reason why they should extend the state of emergency ,_,  she said ._. Hon ._. 
Goni Bukar Lawan ,_,  another federal lawmaker from Yobe State described the emergency rule as an imposition of President Goodluck Jonathan and claimed it was not with the full support of the National Assembly ._. He posed a question to the National Security Adviser NSA ,_,  Col ._. 
Sambo Dasuki ,_,  the Inspector General of Police ,_,  Alhaji MD Abubakar and the president on the use of emergency in the states and what it has achieved so far ._. With huge financial commitment towards to the cause of peace from the Yobe State government ,_,  he said We have never received any report on the security of the state and nothing concrete has been done by the police to take charge of the security situation in the troubled states ._. Another member of the House ,_,  Hon ._. 
Hassan El -_:  Badawry ,_,  insisted that The federal government has not shown the desire to protect the people of Nigeria particularly the people of the Northeast ._. He asked the president not to attempt approaching the National Assembly for an extension of emergency rule ,_,  because both the Senate and the House had agreed that there would be no extension of emergency rule in the three states ._. Although Jonathan might lobby the lawmakers for approval ,_,  whose benefit will it serve because the rumour in town is that he does not want election to hold in the three troubled states which is in the strong grip of the opposition All Progressives Congress APC ._. 
It is believed that any attempt to extend emergency rule ,_,  thereby suspending election in the states would be seen as the manipulation of the electoral process to favour the president ._. Our Independent National Electoral Commission INEC should please learn from the landmark election that took place in Afghanistan at the weekend during which election officials took the bold step of going on to conduct election in spite of threats by the Taliban to send the country into extinction if the elections were held ._. The Central Government in Afghanistan provided adequate security for the conduct of the polls ._. 
It was also reported that there was a 53 per cent voter turn -_: out during the elections and it went on peacefully in most places ._. We all know that the unfortunate insurgency affecting this country has a similar attribute to the Taliban doctrine in Afghanistan even though ours is now assuming a very complicated character ._. 
The INEC should as a matter of counter insurgency approach ,_,  ensure that no part of Nigeria is excluded from the 2015 elections on account of threats ._. Should INEC go ahead with its initially considered exclusion of Adamawa ,_,  Yobe and Borno States from the 2015 elections ,_,  all that the criminal gangs need to do is extend the attacks to other parts of Nigeria and have more places excluded from future elections ._. 
This will then imply that crime and criminality will be victorious in suspending constitutional democracy in Nigeria ,_,  the governor said ._. Perhaps ,_,  the president would heed advice and change strategy in the battle against Boko Haram rather than seek an extension of the emergency rule which now has grave political misinterpretation as against its original objective ,_,  if any ._. 
Lagos � Following increase in attacks by suspected members of the Boko Haram sect ,_,  the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria ASCSN has called on the federal government to take tougher actions against the group ._. ASCSN national president ,_,  Comrade Bobboi Bala Kaigama and the Secretary -_: General ,_,  Comrade Alade Bashir Lawal ,_,  said in Lagos yesterday that there is need for all security agencies in the country to intensify intelligence gathering ._. Improved intelligence surveillance will assist a great deal to unveil sponsors of the group so that they and the murderers who masquerade as religious crusaders can be brought to justice ._. 
As we noted in our previous press statement on the killing of 30 students at Federal Government College ,_,  BuniYadi ,_,  Yobe State in February ,_,  this gang of goons cannot claim to be carrying out any divine doctrine because no religion sanctions the killing of human beings ,_,  the group said ._. It implored the federal government to rise to the occasion by mobilizing the entire citizenry to fight the insurgents ._. This is surely not the time to play politics or trade blames but instead do the needful by fishing out perpetrators of this dastardly act ,_,  it said ._. The union also called on political parties ,_,  civil society groups ,_,  the labour movement ,_,  prominent citizens and religious leaders to unite against Boko Haram insurgents ._. It should be clear to the terrorists and their principals that no society can improve the welfare of its citizens if it is enmeshed in violence not to talk of a country like Nigeria where the populace is denied basic social amenities by the ruling elite even when there was peace across the length and breadth of the country ,_,  it added ._. 
Olufemi Aduwo is the national coordinator of the Rights Monitoring Group RMG ._. 
In this interview ,_,  he says emergency rule is a threat to democracy ._. 
Excerpts :_: With the present insecurity in the Northeast ,_,  do you see the chances of INEC holding elections in the states under emergency ruleAt the beginning ,_,  the federal government did something like test running where the emergency rule was declared in some local government areas ,_,  it did not work ._. 
It back -_: fired ._. 
Now it is going to one year now and it has not worked ,_,  so you have to change tactics ._. 
It is only in Nigeria that you can hear state of emergency like that in short time ._. 
It has to be a long term affair to get to the root of the crisis ._. 
As I talk now ,_,  I don't think the Military know the strength of Boko Haram ,_,  if you want to fight the enemy ,_,  one of the first things to know is the strength of your enemy ,_,  the logistics ,_,  so the emergency is a threat to our democracy ._. 
We must get alternatives to end this crisis ._. 
Contrary to what many believe ,_,  dialogue is still the best option ,_,  this is what America is doing about the insurgency they are tackling though they pretend they were not dialoguing with the insurgents they were tackling ,_,  even though through proxy ,_,  there are many ways of fighting insurgency ._. The government has instituted dialogue mechanisms in the past that seems to have failed ,_,  how do you want government to go about thisGovernment never said they wanted to dialogue ._. 
Remember that there was the Minister of Special Duties committee ._. 
He deceived Nigerians; he told us the Boko Haram agreed to lay down their arms ,_,  when he never spoke to any Boko Haram ._. 
In an ideal society ,_,  this would not happen ._. 
You lied to the government ,_,  and you never do anything at the end of the day it was zero ._. 
Even people in government are not sincere ,_,  their statements and actions are even worse than Boko Haram ._. 
These people are known and I believe there is a way we can all resolve this ,_,  the issue of Military is not working ,_,  so there must be another way out ._. 
Remember ,_,  two years ago when America declared Boko Haram as an international terrorist group ,_,  government said no ,_,  but now they said yes ,_,  we agree ,_,  and want foreign people to assist you ._. There had been complaints that the emergency rule was not yielding positive results because it was not in totality ._. What is not in totality here You want the governors to be sacked ,_,  for what For example ,_,  in Adamawa ,_,  there is no reason to declare state of emergency ,_,  the state is peaceful ,_,  you don't see Army in the streets of Adamawa ,_,  it is peaceful ,_,  except at the borders ._. 
Of all those arrested ,_,  no single persons is a citizen of Adamawa State ,_,  so why are you punishing the whole state I think the Military are not being sincere on why the emergency was declared in Adamawa ._. 
This step is a threat to democracy ._. 
If Pakistan and Afghanistan can still organise elections and they are still managing ,_,  there is no reason not to hold elections in those states ,_,  I think our leaders are not sincere ._. 
You heard what somebody said on VOA ,_,  this is weighty and a serious indictment ,_,  if people we relied upon to save us are the same people who are enemies ,_,  then something is wrong ._. What is your expectation from the national conferenceI don't see anything coming out of this conference it is just for people to talk and go back home ._. 
It is like organizing a seminar on voter education ,_,  the outcome of the seminar is not binding on INEC to take it ._. 
Since there is no legal framework for the conference ,_,  so it is a talk shop ._. 
The government wants amendment of the Constitution to pave way for referendum ,_,  it would not work ._. 
How then do you think the country can move forwardDuring the attack on America then ,_,  the Democrats ,_,  Republicans and others came together to move forward ._. 
But this conference ,_,  you see people pushing for ethnic agenda ,_,  personal interests and so on ._. 
It is good to talk if the people are sincere ._. 
When you go to conference with 10 national agenda and get even two approved ,_,  you move forward and not that everything must be approved ,_,  it does not work like that ._. Do you then see the national conference as an indictment on National AssemblyWe have said it over the years ,_,  people are yearning for true fiscal federalism ._. 
We are running an expensive federal government with so much money is going for overhead cost at the expense of capital projects for national development ._. 
We should use the 1993 conference to form the basis of reducing high cost of governance ._. 
After all ,_,  South African Lawmakers stay in their constituency ,_,  but we are running a government that is too expensive ._. 
We must find ways of reducing that cost ._. 
If the National Assembly has been sincere ,_,  they would have done the needful by amending the Constitution ,_,  so the conference is an indictment on them the National Assembly ,_,  they know the conference report is coming to them and it would go to the dust bin ._. President Goodluck Jonathan's ambition to run in 2015 is being seen as part of the problems confronting the country ._. 
Do you want the president to run in 2015Mr ._. 
President is qualified to contest ,_,  the Constitution guaranteed him that ._. 
Some individuals whether they are 10 ,_,  14 or whatever number cannot take the duty of the people of Nigerians that they signed agreement ,_,  there is nothing wrong in a sitting president being voted out ._. 
What I don't like is the President not declaring his interest to contest when we all know he is interested ._. 
The campaign is on already ,_,  but PDP have problems to address ,_,  Mr ._. 
President inherited 27 state governors ,_,  after the 2011 ,_,  they dropped to 23 ,_,  now they are about 19 and there are about three others whose legs are divided between PDP and APC ._. 
Mr ._. 
President allowed people like Bamaga Tukur to destroy the PDP ._. 
The Progressive Governors Forum PGF and the All Progressives Grand Alliance APGA have condemned Monday's bomb attack which killed many people and injured others in Abuja ._. In a statement signed by its chairman and governor of Imo State ,_,  Rochas Okorocha ,_,  the PGF expressed dismay over frequent attack on innocent Nigerians with the federal government not being able to curtail the trend ._. The statement said ,_,  As if failing to tackle the Boko Haram insurgency is not bad enough ,_,  the security situation has deteriorated to a level where the so -_: called gunmen are now on the rampage across Nigeria ,_,  killing and maiming at will with no response from our poorly equipped and informed security operatives ._. Is it too much for government to at the very least ,_,  identify the perpetrators of these terrible crimesOkorocha added that without meaning to gain political capital out of these unending disasters ,_,  it is plain the government has run out of ideas in the fight against insurgency ,_,  ethnic and communal clashes as well as the spate of armed robbery and kidnappings across Nigeria ._. It appears that the federal government and security agencies need some new initiatives to boost their capacity to carry out the fundamental goal of government ,_,  which is the security of lives and property of citizens ,_,  he said ._. The forum called on the federal government to convene an emergency meeting of the Council of State to discuss the recurrent killings and to put in place new strategies to protect lives and property of the citizenry ._. Similarly ,_,  APGA in a statement condemned the act and called on security agents to fish out the culprits and bring them to book ._. We urge the federal government to sit up and take necessary actions to protect the lives and property of the citizenry in tandem with section 142b of the 1999 Constitution as amended which states that ,_,  security and welfare of the people is the primary purpose of government ._. 
Nigerians expect dividends of democracy not carnage ,_,  APGA said ._. 
Monrovia � The Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to Liberia says she has never referred to some of her countrymen residing in Liberia as agents of the militant group Boko Haram as claimed by protesting individuals calling for her resignation describing their claim as total madness ._. In an interview with reporters Tuesday at the Nigerian Embassy in Congo Town she denied claims made by some protesters that she referred to Nigerians residing in Liberia as criminals ,_,  thieves and Boko -_: Haram agents ._. Maybe they are telling us they are Boko -_: Haram because I don't recall having any exchange with them where I called someone Boko -_: Haram ._. 
Sometime attacks are seen as a method of defense maybe they are sending us a message ,_,  said Ambassador Chigozie F ._. 
Obi -_: NnadozieAmbassador Nnadozie also denied claims by the protesting group that in a meeting with them she described Liberia as an insignificant country ,_,  describing the allegation as total madness and something that is not in her vocabulary as a diplomat with over thirty years experience in Foreign Service ._. That is total madness ,_,  as a diplomat with an experience of 33 years in foreign service I will never say such a word ,_,  it does not exist in my vocabulary it is only a fool that will believe that ._. 
Here I am as a Nigerian ambassador to this country as they claimed I called insignificant if that is a fact than me too I am insignificant ,_,  she added ._. A group of Nigerians recently staged a protest before the Nigerian Embassy in Monrovia calling for the resignation of Ambassador Nnadozie or recall by President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria ._. 
The Nigerian Ambassador though in her own words alluded to facts that there are some bad apples amongst the Nigerian community in Liberia but said there are more good Nigerians than the bad ones ._. The Nigerian Diplomat also confirmed that the Nigerian government is not pleased with the recent protest or attacks on its embassy in Liberia and has said it will not encourage any protest or attack on any of its embassies around the world ._. 
Ambassador Nnadozie commended the Liberian government for its intervention during the recent protest action and disclosed that the ring leaders of the protesters who assembled at the Nigerian embassy on 8 April are currently being investigated by the Liberian Government ._. On the 8th of April a group of Nigerians under the banner Nigerian Community and Descendent Union in Liberia NCDUL staged a protest in demand of the resignation and recall of their Ambassador accredited to Liberia ._. 
The group among several things accused their ambassador of always referring to them as thieves and criminals and not serving their interest ._. Nnadozie Said :_: We don't know what they want ._. 
I feel they just wanted opportunity to dent the character of the Federal Government on the Liberian soil because we don't know what exactly their motives are and I see it as a cleaver way to disrespect the federal government ._. She also alleged that most of the people spotted among the protesters were young Liberian boys from the Old Road community recruited by the individuals claiming to be Naturalized Liberians who have no stake in the affairs of Nigeria while in Liberia something she said is in keeping with the Liberian constitution which prohibits dual citizenship ._. Nigerians against ProtestIn a statement of solidarity a group of Nigerians under the banner Nigerian in Diaspora Organization Liberia NIDOL condemned the protest by those individuals claiming to be Nigerians and promised to in the strongest term resist any attempt by the group to disturb their embassy ._. 
In a position statement presented to their ambassador they described the protest as unwarranted and infamous demonstration instigated by those they referred to as handful of hooligans ._. The group also described as ridiculous that members of the so -_: called Nigerian Community and Descendants' Union in Liberia could carry young boys from the streets to carry placards in front of the Nigeria House ,_,  calling for the resignation and recall of their ambassador ._. The Group said in its statement :_:  NCDUL is where some individuals who have renounced their Nigerian Citizenship and claim to be Naturalized Liberians hide themselves to soil the image of Nigeria in Liberia ._. 
As a matter of fact ,_,  they are on their own and have no right to speak for Nigerian Citizens in Liberia ._. The group continued in its statement :_:  the real Nigerian Citizens applaud her Excellency Ambassador for her open door policy ,_,  her Motherly approach and her strong sense of accomplishment ._. 
Nigerians are proud of her and admire her hard work and good work in Liberia ._. 
Monrovia � For the first time in decades a violent protest ,_,  staged by disconcerted Nigerian citizens in Liberia ,_,  rocked the serenity and security of the Nigerian House in Congo Town ._. 
The unfortunate incident ,_,  which protesters claimed came in the wake of pent up grievances ,_,  reportedly left several injured and further aggrieved ._. 
But a counter Nigerian group thinks the reported injuries are as questionable as were the grievances that orchestrated the violent protest ._. 
The Analyst ,_,  reports ._. The Liberia -_: based Nigerians in Diaspora Organization NIDO has condemned the demonstration in front of the Nigeria Embassy on April 8 ,_,  2014 ._. NICO said some �misguided Nigerians� that included Harrison Eva Aniukwu ,_,  Vicent Abuka ,_,  Bartho Frank ,_,  Alpha Ikejiaku and casket -_: bearer Okey Emordi ,_,  led the demonstration against the Nigerian Embassy in Congo Town for selfish reasons ._. Conservative media reports said the demonstration turned bloody when a Liberian police unit moved in to disperse violent protesters ._. But NIDO said reasons for the demonstration as well as what media reports said transpired were the figment of the imaginations of those who were bent on tarnishing the reputation of the Nigerian envoy in Liberia ._. In the group's view ,_,  the demonstration was not necessary because the embassy has opened several service and conflict resolution hubs to help address problems facing Nigerian citizens working and living in Liberia ._. NIDO's comments were contained in a press release it issued Monday ,_,  this week ,_,  under the signature of public relations officer PRO Sadiq S ._. 
Umar to set the record straight and to point out the way to a more peaceful ,_,  law -_: abiding ,_,  and cooperative Nigerian Community in Liberia ._. Claiming that the protesters comprised mainly some members of the �so -_: called Nigerian Community and Descendants Union of Liberia NCDUL� ,_,  make -_: believe naturalized Liberians ,_,  and �misguided partners� ,_,  NIDO said it was time it revealed the truth of what transpired on April 8 ._. �There was no bloodshed during that unwarranted and infamous demonstration on Tuesday ,_,  8 April ,_,  2014 ,_,  when a handful of these hooligans demonstrated in front of the Nigeria House ,_, � NIDO claimed ._. It described as �ridiculous� what it considered NCDUL's recruitment of �young boys from the streets to hold placards in front of the Nigeria House ,_,  calling for Ambassador's resignation and on the Nigerian government to immediately recall a hardworking Ambassador� and noted that the action was unfortunate and counterproductive ._. The group believed NCDUL has no justification for exposing innocent individuals to security risk in the name of demand for rights and redress because there were willingness within the embassy and laws on the books to protect their interests and provide prompt redress ._. �The right of Nigerians residing in Liberia and that of the Nigeria Embassy in Liberia as enshrined in article 31b of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations ,_,  which prescribes the protection in the Receiving State ,_,  of the interests of the Sending State and of its nationals ,_,  within the limits permitted by international law; was not observed in this case ,_, � NIDO noted ._. The group questioned the identities of the demonstrators and described NCDUL as hideout for individuals who ,_,  having renounced their Nigerian citizenship and claimed Liberian citizenship ,_,  have decided to attack the image of Nigeria in Liberia ._. 
It said that explained why they were bent on creating confusion rather than appreciating the mechanism in place at the embassy to address the grievances and problems of the Nigerian Community in Liberia ._. �As a matter ,_,  they are on their own and have no right to speak on behalf of Nigerian citizens in Liberia ._.

Obi -_: Nnadozie has branded members of the community �terrorists and Boko Haram insurgents� ._. �It was a concerned Nigerian who likened the activities of these naturalized Liberians which are tarnishing the image of Nigeria in Liberia; as those of Boko Haram agents ._. 
The Embassy has always discharged its responsibilities regarding the repatriation of the remains of deceased Nigerian citizens provided proof of their citizenship is provided and/or they are registered with the Embassy as Nigerian citizens ,_, � NIDO said ._. It said it was to provide such services to all Nigerians that it has been urging all residents to register with the embassy and NIDO at the rate of US $10 per head and with a valid Nigerian passport and a Liberian residency permit ._. NIDO did not say whether the United States ten dollars was all that was required financially to register with both entities ,_,  but it said registration was all that was necessary to ensure embassy protection in Liberia ._. 
�The US $10 registration fee that Nigerians are required to pay is to cover the cost of producing the new and improved plastic Identity Card ._. 
How is this the business of these same NCDUL members� the release wondered ._.

It said the President's quick return to the hustings was reprehensible and has shown that his visit to the scene of the blast was merely to avoid the kind of flak he has received for refusing to visit Yobe ,_,  where 43 school children were massacred recently ,_,  rather than a genuine show of sympathy by a truly compassionate leader ._. The message that President Jonathan is sending to Nigerians is that keeping his plum job ,_,  at all cost ,_,  is more important to him than the security and welfare of the same people who voted him into office ._. 
Otherwise ,_,  the President would not have rushed back to his illegal campaign trail at a time he should be leading the nation in mourning the dead ._. A President who said his ambition is not worth the blood of anyone is now dancing gleefully on the graves of over 70 of his compatriots ._.

This was even as the Inspector General of Police ,_,  Mohammed Abubakar ,_,  yesterday ,_,  asked Nigerians to rise in unity against terrorism in the country ._. Abubakar spoke through the Police Force Public Relations Officer ,_,  CSP Frank Mba ,_,  in Abuja ,_,  describing the explosion at the bus terminus as unfortunate terrorist attack ._.

Babangida Aliyu ,_,  in a statement by his Press Secretary ,_,  Mallam Danladi Ndayebo ,_,  said there was no basis for what the perpetrators did ,_,  adding that the loss of innocent lives due to the explosion was regrettable ._. Aliyu expressed the forum's deepest condolences to the families of the victims ,_,  saying no grievance can justify such a dastardly act against defenceless Nigerians ._. The forum ,_,  however ,_,  called for vigilance ,_,  emphasising that the issue of security should not be left to security agents alone ._. He said :_:  The issue of security should not be left to government alone ._. 
All hands must be on deck to stop the activities of terrorists ,_,  which have left hundreds of innocent Nigerians either dead or wounded ._. The governors however ,_,  asked security agencies not to be discouraged by the activities of terrorists ._. 
The abduction of about 100 girls of a secondary school in Chibok ,_,  Borno State ,_,  by some unknown persons dominated the plenary session of the ongoing National Conference on Tuesday with many delegates demanding drastic actions to contain the security challenges confronting the nation ._. Some of the delegate decried the alleged politicisation of the security challenges by the two main political parties in Nigeria ,_,  the Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  and the All Progressives Congress ,_,  APC ,_,  and the decision of the former to go ahead with its rally in Kano while the nation's young citizens were being held by abductors ._. The school girls were abducted by suspected Boko Haram men who invaded the Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  carted away goods from the store and took the girls away ._.

Ismail painted a gory picture of the incident ,_,  saying the only crime of the innocent children was that they agreed to be educated ._. In his contribution ,_,  a clergyman and delegate from the South West zone ,_,  said the Conference should send a strong signal on the matter and other security issues by shutting down its proceedings as a show of solidarity with the victims of insurgent activities ._. It is a state of war ._. 
Politicians must take politics entirely out of this issue ._. 
There are external sponsors who must be identified ,_,  he said ._. Another delegate ,_,  Annkio Briggs said :_:  I speak as a mother ,_,  I speak as a woman ,_,  I speak as a Nigerian ._. 
What is happening in Nigeria happens because of what some people whether inside or outside have decided will happen ._. Ms ._. 
Briggs said although one part of Nigeria was principally affected by the acts of terror ,_,  it was almost uncertain if the killings and bombing could still be contained any longer ._. She stated that it was time for Nigerians to come together and decide on what was best for the country because this is no longer about politics ,_,  it is about the security of the country ._. A former governor of Ogun State ,_,  Segun Osoba ,_,  suggested the closure of Nigeria's borders with Cameroon ,_,  Chad ,_,  and Niger Republic if the insurgent activities must be stopped ._. Mr ._. 
Osoba also said the conference secretariat should lead a delegation to President Goodluck Jonathan to convey the views the delegates canvassed on the security matters ._. A Civil Society delegate ,_,  Ezenwa Nwagwu ,_,  regretted that while other delegates were saying that security matters should be divorced from politics ,_,  a political party is holding a rally in Kano ._. He stressed ,_,  I hear some people saying we should send a delegation to this man jonathan who asked us to help him ._. Ledum Mitee ,_,  a Federal Government delegate ,_,  said at a time like this ,_,  dirty political mudslinging and blame -_: sharing must give way to decent reasoning among political leaders towards finding solutions to the problem ._. He said the Conference should take advantage of the human resources available by asking each of the 20 Standing Committees to come up with their suggestion on how to tackle the security challenges ._. This is not the time to grandstand ,_,  he cautioned ,_,  we may have elders but at a time like this ,_,  we need statesmen who should rise up and lead the nation out of this mess ._. 
This is no time for politics ._. Fati Ibrahim said the Conference must look beyond expression of sympathy and the national mourning and take practical steps to ensure that the girls who have been abducted were returned in good condition ._. Ramatu Usman demanded to know if there were no elders in the communities whose citizens have been subjected to suffering and death ,_,  adding that as people who are respected by everyone ,_,  the elders should be able to identify those behind and those actually perpetrating the ugly development ._. According to her ,_,  if it were possible to identify the people behind the dreaded Maitasine sect in the past ,_,  if it were possible to identify aggrieved youths of the Niger Delta and brought the situation under control ,_,  if it were possible to identity the OPC members in the west ,_,  then why can't Boko Haram members be identifiedTanko Ayuba ,_,  a delegate of the North West zone ,_,  demanded a complete overhaul of the security system and that Nigeria's borders with some countries should be closed because they were too porous ._. In addition ,_,  he said modern surveillance equipment and technology should be deployed to tackle the security problems ._. The time for talk is over ._.

Maroua � Nigeria's extremist Islamist group Boko Haram are believed to be actively recruiting fighters across the border in Cameroon's Far North Region ,_,  according to residents and local government officials ._. More than 100 suspected Boko Haram fighters and preachers the latter presumed to have links with the group ,_,  have been arrested in Far North Region since 2012 ,_,  but many have been released due to lack of evidence ,_,  according to a local security official ._. There are many Muslim brothers coming from Nigeria with the aim of preaching to the youths ._. 
The government has warned against this practice ,_,  but they still reach out to the young people because they make them promises and give them money ,_,  said Ibrahim Haman ,_,  an Islamic preacher and elder in Mora District in the Far North ._. Residents of Mayo -_: Sava area in Far North Region say that unidentified preachers are secretly reaching out to youths in their locality ._. 
Haman pointed out that some youths have managed to escape the sect after being recruited ,_,  but many others have not returned ._. Boko Haram is considered here as just another religious group ,_,  and it is not difficult to be a member if you want to ._. 
Young people from here have been induced into joining Boko Haram ,_,  he said ._. Military trainingSeventeen -_: year -_: old Mustapha* recounted to IRIN how he was brought back home to Cameroon blindfolded after failing to cope with the insurgents' military training ._. 
He had been taken to Nigeria by a preacher ._. I was the youngest among eight other boys who told me they came from the towns of Banki ,_,  Kolofata and Ngeshawa in Cameroon and Maiduguri in Nigeria  ._. 
Before I was taken ,_,  they told my father that I would come back rich and a great Muslim ,_,  so he allowed me to go ._. 
We were reading the Koran and they would preach to us about fighting for the Muslim faith ,_,  said Mustapha ._. I went for my second military training in the mountains ,_,  but suffered many injuries and I was bedridden for one month ,_,  he said ,_,  explaining that he was brought back as his injuries ruled him unfit for combat ._. A government official in Mora District ,_,  however ,_,  said that it is difficult to ascertain that Boko Haram is recruiting from Cameroonian border villages ._. 
There are similar ethnic communities in Cameroon's Far North and northeastern Nigeria who have family on either side of the border ,_,  speak the same language and share a common culture ,_,  making undetected cross -_: border movement easy ._. We don't really have enough evidence to say clearly that Boko Haram recruits Cameroonians ,_,  but what is clear is that those fighting with them are from the border regions and can claim the nationality of either country whenever it suits them ,_,  said the official on condition of anonymity ._. But a Mora resident who gave his name only as Daibu said that his brother disappeared in 2012 soon after joining a local Koranic school ._. 
He just left and never came back ._. 
We heard from people that he had joined Boko Haram ._. Widening threatThe threat of Boko Haram is widespread in Cameroonian villages bordering northeastern Nigeria ._. 
A Nigerian military offensive launched in May 2013 pushed back the Islamists from major towns in the country's northeast to remote areas ._. 
But attacks by the insurgents have since become more deadly and frequent ._. There are suspicions that Boko Haram is also recruiting from neighbouring Niger ._. 
Some observers have also linked the group with Islamist insurgents who seized Mali's north after the March 2012 overthrow of the government in Bamako ._. Insecurity in Cameroon's Far North Region caused by Boko Haram has crippled trade between the region and northeastern Nigeria ._. 
Yaound� authorities have bolstered security ,_,  but infiltration and kidnappings by gunmen suspected to be linked to the radical Islamists have not stopped ._. In the third kidnapping of foreigners here since early 2013 ,_,  suspected Boko Haram fighters earlier this month seized two Italian priests and a Canadian nun ._. Boko Haram had sent a letter to villages with warnings that all beer parlours should stop the sale of alcohol in Mora ,_,  Banki and other localities along the border ._. 
We can't identify them but we just know that they are among us or have informants here ,_,  said Mercel Kenfor ,_,  a trader in Mora ._. The Mora government official told IRIN :_:  Boko Haram has often sent warnings to the communities ._. 
We have issued a curfew from 6pm to 6am that covers all communities in Mora District ._. 
We also forbid motorbike traffic at night because we discovered that Boko Haram use motorbikes to commit crimes ._. There are military patrols as well ,_,  said the official ,_,  but the military needs to be given the right weapons and capacity to fight Boko Haram that has more lethal weapons like rocket launchers and grenades ._. We strongly believe that Boko Haram has elements in Cameroon and the authorities are doing everything possible to track them down ._. 
The manoeuvres they make in Cameroon territory is evidence that these groups have a good mastery of the terrain and the armed men could include local Cameroonians and those from neighbouring countries ,_,  said Emmanuel Bob -_: Iga ,_,  head of the police division at the Far North governor's office ._. Military commander Beaufils Mana said Boko Haram incursions are being abetted by some local residents ._. It is obvious that Boko Haram uses some Cameroonians ._. 
This is because an intruder cannot enter your territory when he has no idea of the area ._. 
Boko Haram must be colluding with Cameroonians to be able to move around easily ._. *Not a real name This report does not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations ._.

Okei -_: Odumakin ._. Nigerian citizens must hold the government accountable for the numerous killings and wanton waste of lives of innocent citizens ,_,  she added ._. Mrs ._. 
Akiyode -_: Afolabi noted that the government has a responsibility to protect human lives within its territory ._.

Akiyode -_: Afolabi said ._. The two groups further condemned the terrorists for the abduction of the girls and their continued target of innocent women ,_,  children and girls ._. Women and girls have been victims of these conflicts ._. 
The insurgency has exposed this group of people to destitution ,_,  physical and mental insecurity ,_,  the groups said in the statement ._. We are concerned that when women and girls are abducted in this manner during conflict ,_,  they are often exposed to untold hardships of sexual violence and bodily assault as part of the spoils of war ._. Nigeria has adopted the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and 1820 which address ,_,  amongst others things ,_,  the need for state parties to take steps to prevent further violations of women's rights in conflict situations ,_,  and to protect and ensure women's participation in post -_: conflict reconstruction processes ._.

A local government official ,_,  who does not want to be named for security reasons ,_,  said We are in difficult times in Gwoza local government; deaths and killings has become a daily affair; 18 people were killed in Wala this morning by the Boko Haram gunmen ._. A senior officer of the Department of State Security Service ,_,  DSS ,_,  also confirmed the killing in Wala; but asked not to be quoted ._. We have just received the report from our officers in Gwoza that the Boko Haram gunmen had attacked Wala village and killed 18 poor souls there; it is rather unfortunate and sad development despite our efforts up here ,_,  he said ._. The DSS officer also confirmed that some 12 hours earlier ,_,  another set of gunmen attacked Sabon -_: Kasuawa Village in Hawul Local Government Area ,_,  210km south of Maiduguri ,_,  where they killed a local monarch district head and his guard ._. A politician from Hawul Local Government ,_,  Hyeldi Bwala ,_,  confirmed to PREMIUM TIMES on phone that the gunmen attacked the monarch shortly after he returned home from the mosque where he went to observe the Tuesday night prayers at about 7 :_: 30 p ._. m ._. They simply walked right into the palace of the monarch and shot him in his bedroom ._. 
And on their way out they also shot at his guard before fleeing away into the dark night ,_,  said Mr ._. 
Bwala ._. Wala Village is also about 130km away from Chibok town where over 100 secondary school girls were abducted on Monday night by suspected members of the Boko Haram ._. 
The students are yet to be found ._. The top monarch of Gwoza ,_,  Idrissa Timta who is addressed as Emir of Gwoza ,_,  had last week made a save our -_: soul plea to the Nigerian government and security agencies to come to the aid of Gwoza residents whom he said suffer too frequent attacks ._. We in Gwoza have suffered too many attacks ,_,  killings and destruction ,_,  in the past weeks and months ._. 
There is no day that we don't mourn the death of at least seven people who were being killed by the insurgents ,_,  the monarch told journalists ._. Our people have been forced to flee ,_,  our markets no longer operate optimally ,_,  food items ,_,  goods and wares are no longer coming into Gwoza for a long time now ._. 
We want action from government so that lives can be saved; if nothing is done we have no other option than to desert our homelands and flee in to the neighbouring Cameroon towns where we may perhaps get protection ._. Gwoza is the one of the mountainous countryside of Borno State that shares borders with Cameroon in its south and Sambissa in its north ._. 
Gwoza's rocky mountains have served as a hideout for Boko Haram terrorists ._. The Borno attacks have continued despite an emergency rule imposed on the state ,_,  as well as Adamawa and Yobe ,_,  since May last year ._. 
Nigerians were still in a daze following the blast at a motor park on Abuja city outskirts that claimed dozens of lives when news filtered in yesterday about yet another outrage committed by suspected Boko Haram insurgents ._. They raided the Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  Chibok in Borno State on Monday night and reportedly abducted nearly 200 girls ._. 
Borno State Police Commissioner Lawan Tanko confirmed that there was an incident in Chibok but did not give any details ,_,  saying these were still being compiled ._. However ,_,  reporters heard from other security sources and distraught parents that there indeed was a mass abduction ,_,  which they said is the first of its kind since the commencement of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009 ._. 
The girls ,_,  aged between 16 and 18 were reportedly writing their final year senior secondary school examinations when the raid and abduction happened ._. Even though this is a very ugly twist to the insurgents' tactics that is bound to cause consternation and disgust all over this country and abroad ,_,  it was not really the first time that Boko Haram insurgents would abduct young women ._. During previous attacks on schools in Yobe State reports had it that even though the insurgents spared female students when they shot their male counterparts ,_,  they however abducted some of them and carted them away in their vehicles ._. 
There were no reports of the girls having returned to their families ._. Monday night's incident at Chibok however outclassed all previous abduction incidents on sheer scale ._. 
Moving 200 young girls out of the school compound was a big logistical operation that ,_,  according to some town residents ,_,  entailed several lorry trips lasting many hours ._. 
One of the questions being asked was why no security agents came to the aid of the girls while the raid lasted ._. 
A second question is what the girls were doing there ,_,  since the Borno State Government had earlier closed all schools in the state in order to avert just such incidents ._. 
Even though some observers thought closing the schools was too drastic and that it caved in to the insurgents' anti -_: Western education agenda ,_,  Monday night's episode shows that it was a necessary measure to take for now ._. A top security source was quoted yesterday to have said that the GGSS Chibok school's authorities directed the girls to go and write their exams without adequate authorization and clearance from security agencies ._. 
If investigation confirms this ,_,  then the persons involved must be made to answer for this major security lapse ._. Yet another puzzle is what the insurgents would want with so many young girls and how and where they could possible hide them ._. 
Truly ,_,  several women that managed to escape or were rescued by soldiers from sacked Boko Haram camps told stories of being held as sex slaves against their will ._. 
They said they cooked the insurgents' food ,_,  did other menial duties for them and were also sexually abused in the name of being married to the insurgents ._. 
Yet ,_,  their descriptions suggested the existence of small insurgent camps in the forests or rocky areas where a few women were held captive at a time ._. 
A camp that could hold 200 abducted girls must be very large indeed ._. 
Many people are wondering if such a camp exists after the acclaimed gains made by soldiers against the insurgents in recent months ._. There was a ray of hope yesterday that the girls' ordeal could be short given that soldiers were already hot on the trail of the abductors ._. 
A report said serious collaboration between various security agencies is yielding results ._. 
The truck that was conveying the girls broke down in the bush before it reached its destination ._. 
We are now trying to locate where the girls were taken to ._. 
Many of the girls managed to jump out of the trucks while some clung to tree branches as they were being ferried through the bush ._. 
They later found their way back home ._. It is to be expected that a major security operation is already underway to track the abductors and to free the young girls ._. 
Their large number increases the possibility that they would be found because it is not easy to conceal such a large number of people in a rural area or even an urban one ._. 
The insurgents are known to cross Nigeria's borders into neighbouring countries at will ._. 
If they do take the abductees across the border ,_,  the Chadian and Cameroonian police will be challenged to find them ._. 
They might be better able to do so than Nigerian security agents given the relatively authoritarian character of those countries ._. All told ,_,  Nigerians will be waiting with bated breaths for any stories that the abducted girls have been rescued and safely reunited to their families ._. 
That at least would be one happy ending to a tale of grief ,_,  sorrow ,_,  tears ,_,  blood and incredulity that has been the Boko Haram insurgency ._. 
The Nigerian military has confirmed that it has freed majority of the 129 female students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State ._. The students were kidnapped on Monday night by suspected Boko Haram members ._. In a statement on Wednesday evening ,_,  the spokesperson of the Defence Headquarters ,_,  DHQ ,_,  Chris Olukolade ,_,  confirmed that only 8 of the girls were still held captive by the soldiers ._. Of the 129 kidnapped students ,_,  the Borno State Governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  earlier in the day confirmed that 14 of the girls escaped from their abductors ._. More students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok have been freed this evening in the on -_: going search and rescue operations to free the abducted students ,_,  Mr ._. 
Olukolade ,_,  a Major General ,_,  said ._. With this development ,_,  the Principal of the School confirmed that only 8 of the students are still missing ._. 
One of the terrorists who carried out the attack on the school has also been captured ._. Efforts are underway to locate the remaining 8 students ._. With 14 of the girls escaping on their own ,_,  and 8 still unaccounted for ,_,  it implies the military freed 107 of the kidnapped female students ._. 
Suspected Boko Haram insurgents have killed 18 traders returning from a local market on Borno highways ._. It was gathered that the sect attacked two buses on the Bama -_: Gwoza road; and shot dead 18 traders who were returning from a market at Pulka on Tuesday at about 4pm ._. Pulka is Nigerian border town with Cameroon; and 119 kilometres south of Maiduguri ,_,  the capital of troubled Borno state ._. The marauders ,_,  according to an eyewitness ,_,  Hamba Tada ambushed the traders ,_,  who were going back to their homes after selling their wares ,_,  at Wala village ,_,  10 kilometres to Gwoza ._. 
The Ijaw Youth Council IYC yesterday indicted the Presidency over the spate of bombing rocking the northern axis of the country ._. The IYC said the Presidency could not claim ignorance of the identities of the sponsors of the dastardly act ,_,  which has led to the death of many Nigerians ,_,  particularly in the North -_: East geopolitical zone of the country ._. To this end ,_,  the group in a statement issued by its spokesman ,_,  Mr ._. 
Eric Omare ,_,  in reaction to Monday's bomb explosions at Nyanya market ,_,  Abuja ,_,  in which over 100 persons were reported dead ,_,  asked President Goodluck Jonathan to speedily identify and punish the sponsors of the heinous crime ._. IYC accused Jonathan of not being desicive in the war against terrorism and called for drastic actions against sponsors of Boko Haram and terrorism ._. The umbrella body for the youths of Ijaw extraction in the Niger Delta condemned the terrorist attack on the Abuja market and commiserated with the families of the victims ._. The Ijaw group notes that Tuesday's sad development in Abuja indicated that the perpetrators planned to extend the heinous crime to others parts of the country with the ulterior motive of making the country ungovernable and overthrow the democratically elected government ._. Consequently ,_,  it urged the Federal Government to extend the emergency rule in the North -_: East ._. IYC said ,_,  However ,_,  considering the deadly nature of attack and the implication on our national security ,_,  the IYC call on the Federal Government of Nigeria to take drastic and far reaching steps against sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria ._. 
The problem of terrorism cannot be resolved without tackling the source of their sponsorship ._. The sponsors of Boko Haram should be arrested and made to face the full wrath of the law ._. 
The Federal Government cannot claim ignorance of the sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria with all the security apparatus at its disposal ._. 
Government must act decisively irrespective of whose ox is gored and protect the ordinary people of Nigeria ._. The interest of the generality of Nigerians is over and above the interest of a few powerhungry people who are sponsoring terrorism ._. 
The IYC wish to reiterate its earlier position that the ultimate objective of the sponsors of Boko Haram and terrorism is to make the country ungovernable and forcefully take over the government of Nigeria ._. 
Hence ,_,  it is an issue that government must treat with utmost seriousness ,_,  IYC added ._. 
The Syrian government on Wednesday condemned a bomb attack in Abuja which killed at least 75 people and left many others injured ._. Over 124 people were also injured when an explosive device went off at a populous motor park in Nyanya ,_,  Abuja on Monday morning ._. 
Witnesses said the casualties were much higher than the official figures ._. The incident also left over 124 persons injured ._. 
The attack is believed to have been carried out by the Boko Haram terrorist group ._. In a statement released by its Nigerian embassy ,_,  the Syrian government called on the international community to act quickly to forestall further attacks ._. The international community ,_,  the embassy said ,_,  should seriously confront this al -_: Qaeda -_: linked bloody takfiri terrorism ,_,  which has transformed into an international phenomenon threatening the world peace and security ._. Syria ,_,  which is currently experiencing a civil war that has led to the death of tens of thousands of people ,_,  also demanded that countries ,_,  groups and individuals that are funding and backing terrorism be prosecuted ._. While stating its solidarity with the Nigerian people ,_,  the Syrian government also condoled with the families of the victims of Monday's blast ._. 
Maiduguri � Islamic terrorists struck for the fourth time in three days in the country ,_,  killing 20 people including a traditional ruler in attacks on Borno State ,_,  local government and security officials said Wednesday ._. The unprecedented string of attacks has many questioning the role of politicians in the insurgency and the ability of the military to contain the five -_: year -_: old Islamic uprising that has resulted in the death of more than 1 ,_, 500 people this year ,_,  compared with an estimated 3 ,_, 600 from 2010 to 2012 ._. Yesterday morning ,_,  gunmen attacked the village of Wala ,_,  in Gwoza district ,_,  and killed 18 people ,_,  and injured several others ,_,  according to a local government official and intelligence agent ._. 
They both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to reporters ._. Wala village is in Gwoza Local Government Area ,_,  some 130 kilometres southwest of Maiduguri ,_,  the Borno State capital ._. The local government official said :_:  We are in difficult times in Gwoza Local Government; deaths and killings have become a daily affair; 18 people were killed in Wala this morning by the Boko Haram gunmen ._. A senior officer of the Department of State Security Service DSS also confirmed the killing in Wala ,_,  but asked not to be quoted ._. We have just received the report from our officers in Gwoza that the Boko Haram gunmen attacked Wala village and killed 18 poor souls there; it is a rather an unfortunate and sad development despite our efforts up here ,_,  he said ._. The DSS officer also confirmed that some 12 hours earlier ,_,  another set of gunmen attacked Sabon -_: Kasuawa village in Hawul Local Government Area ,_,  210 kilometres south of Maiduguri ,_,  where they killed a district head and his guard ._. They simply walked right into the palace of the monarch and shot him in his bedroom ,_,  and on their way out they also shot his guard before fleeing ,_,  said politician Hyeldi Bwala ._. Just last week ,_,  the Emir of the embattled Gwoza ,_,  Idrissa Timta ,_,  had appealed to the government to save our souls ,_,  saying his people were being attacked daily ._. We in Gwoza have suffered too many attacks ,_,  killings and destruction in the past weeks and months ._. 
There is no day that we don't mourn the death of at least seven people who are being killed by the insurgents ,_,  the monarch had told journalists ._. Our people have been forced to flee ,_,  our markets no longer operate optimally ,_,  food items ,_,  goods and wares are no longer coming into Gwoza for a long time now ._. 
We want action from government so that lives can be saved; if nothing is done ,_,  we have no other option than to desert our homelands and flee into the neighbouring Cameroun towns where we may perhaps get protection ,_,  he added ._. Gwoza is the one of mountainous countryside of Borno State that shares borders with Cameroun in its south and Sambissa in its north ._. 
Gwoza's rocky mountains have served as a hideout for Boko Haram terrorists ._. 
Former Federal Commissioner for Works and Housing and renowned lawyer ,_,  Alhaji Femi Okunnu ,_,  spoke to Ojo M ._. 
Maduekwe on issues of security in the country and the way forward ._. 
Excerpts :_: Since it is established that the Boko Haram sect has no justifiable basis for its actions ,_,  how do you think the federal government should contain the menaceLet us start from the beginning; and I will start with the failure of successive federal governments to point out exactly what Boko Haram as a group wants; what's their mission There is total failure of intelligence gathering by the previous governments to find out exactly what the group wants ._. There's the simple translation of their name ,_,  'Book is forbidden'  -_:  Boko Haram ._. 
But that's not what they want ._. 
That is not their mission because ,_,  knowledge is universal ._. 
Before the white man acquired knowledge ,_,  the ancient Egyptians invented hieroglyphics ._. 
The Arabs ,_,  through Algebra ,_,  made their contributions to knowledge; and that's the centre of Islam ._. 
So Islam can never be against knowledge ._. 
The translation of their name is too simplistic ,_,  because the centre of civilisation in the world at one time was Egypt ._. 
Even in the Middle East ,_,  we had Persia as a civilised empire at one time ._. 
So it cannot be that knowledge is what they don't want ,_,  because knowledge to know ,_,  is at the heart of Islam ._. Prophet Mohammed was a stark illiterate who could not read and write but ,_,  the first message he received from Angel Jubril was read in the name of your lord ._. 
So how can Islam be against knowledge Prophet Mohammed himself said if you'll get knowledge in China ,_,  go and acquire knowledge even in China ._. 
Boko Haram has other ulterior motives and not because they are against knowledge because ,_,  if they do ,_,  then they are not true Muslims ._. What are the security agencies doing to know exactly what the Boko Haram stands for Till today ,_,  people still don't know what they want ._. 
They're saying they want an Islamic Republic and that they don't want people to go to school but most of their leaders went to school ._. 
What do they want It's not for us to keep on guessing ,_,  it's for the government to determine to find out by whatever means what exactly they want ._. If it's against poverty ,_,  then the government should come out with solution ._. 
I'm not talking about the federal government because welfare is basically a state function ._. 
The state and federal government have roles to play ._. If the government succeeds in infiltrating their ranks and discovers what it is they really want; even if their demands are genuine ,_,  it would not justify their attacks ._. 
Do you support amnesty or are you in favour of the use of force by the governmentForce alone cannot solve any problem ._. 
If the government knows what they want ,_,  they should give it to them if it is for the good of the people ._. 
If it is for the reduction of poverty ,_,  what is the business of both the state and federal government ,_,  especially the state governments ,_,  but to reduce poverty; make life easier for people; open up schools; open up hospitals in rural areas; create jobs and make agriculture to take up againHow do you think the federal government should partner its neighbouring countries to address this scourge This is one issue I have debated with myself for quite some time now ._. 
I don't want international intervention in our fight against Boko Haram or terrorism in the North -_: eastern part of the country ._. 
We have to be very careful about international intervention ._. 
If you look at Afghanistan and Pakistan ,_,  with American drones killing innocent people in their search for Al Qaeda targets ,_,  you'll understand why I do not want any international intervention ,_,  especially by any European power ._. I was the person in 1960 ,_,  who blew the whistle about the Anglo -_: Nigeria Defence Pact before Independence when the Britain wanted to establish what they called a listening post in Kano ._. 
I blew it up until the pact was revoked ._. 
I'm not going to live today to see America come into Borno or Yola to bomb any part of the country on our behalf ._. The menace can still be contained by us ._. 
But I am worried about the role of our neighbouring countries especially Cameroun and Chad ._. 
From reports which we read ,_,  the Al Qaeda group in the Boko Haram cross the border between Nigeria and Cameroon or the border near the Chad ._. 
I am very much perturbed at the passivity of our government in coming to some understanding or pact with the Cameroons and Chad ,_,  to see how to control cross -_: border activity by Boko Haram ._. I have not read of any attempt by the federal government to reach out publicly to these countries ._. 
The activities of Boko Haram across the border ,_,  and especially the failure of the federal government to publicly acknowledge the need to have treaties with our neighbours to contain Boko Haram across the border ,_,  do trouble me ._. 
It would be left to the Nigerian government to see what they can do on the ground within the country ._. I feel it is necessary to appeal to all political leaders in this country to stop politicising Boko Haram and stop accusing each other of creating it ._. 
They should stop playing politics with the lives and security of our people and join hands to stop this mindless killings of innocent people; whether Muslims or Christians ._. 
Also ,_,  the federal government should enter into meaningful discussions with our neighbouring countries ,_,  particularly Cameroon and Chad ,_,  to ensure that Boko Haram does not have a base in those countries ._. In specific ,_,  what can the involvement of European countries do to Nigeria in combating terrorism Apart from assisting in intelligence gathering and logistics ,_,  the European countries should keep off ._. 
Their involvement would complicate our problem ._. 
They'll create more problems than they want to solve ._. 
Their military should not be on our soil ._. 
The terrorism menace is something we can solve by ourselves ._. 
We've solved bigger problems in this country ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  we went through civil war and we survived ._. While applying military force to contain Boko Haram ,_,  the government can still find a way of talking to them ._. 
Boko Haram is creating war in this country ._. 
There are other wars being fought in other parts of the country ._. 
We should be spending more time making peace among the people and stop promoting ethnicity among Nigerians; a new phenomenon ._. 
Let us find ways of bringing our people together and not invite foreign interventions ._. Do you think it is possible for the PDP and APC to work together in tackling terrorism They don't need to work together but stop making inflammatory statements and throwing stones in accusing one another of promoting Boko Haram ._. 
They should try and preach peace among the people ._. 
Some of the properties of Ansar Ud Deen Society of Nigeria ,_,  a Muslim organisation that was 90 years last year December ,_,  which I am the national president ,_,  have been damaged and our people killed ._. 
So Boko Haram doesn't spare you because you're a Muslim ._. 
A good friend of mine ,_,  General Shua ,_,  a Muslim who commanded the Nigerian Army First Division during the civil war ,_,  returned from Friday prayers about a year or two ago and was killed by Boko Haram ._. Sadly ,_,  activities of Boko Haram are so overwhelming that little or no attention is paid to the victims ._. 
But the victims are potential threats if abandoned to their fate ._. 
How do you propose government addresses their predicament This is a very serious issue ._. 
Sometime ago ,_,  I listened to an Aljazeera programme about Somalia refugees ._. 
This is a crisis that Nigeria needs to settle down to address ._. 
When I say Nigeria ,_,  I mean the federal government which has huge resources ._. 
This is a disaster that we are facing and the federal government needs to setup proper camps  -_:  camps for those affected to live their lives ._. 
The state governments should come in; also the big brother which has the money as well as the vote from the parliament ._. 
The government should use whatever agency they have on the ground or create one if there is none ._. 
The Nigerian military has confirmed that it has freed majority of the 129 female students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State ._. The students were kidnapped on Monday night by suspected Boko Haram members ._. In a statement on Wednesday evening ,_,  the spokesperson of the Defence Headquarters ,_,  DHQ ,_,  Chris Olukolade ,_,  confirmed that only 8 of the girls were still held captive by the insurgents ._. Of the 129 kidnapped students ,_,  the Borno State Governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  earlier in the day confirmed that 14 of the girls escaped from their abductors ._. More students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok have been freed this evening in the on -_: going search and rescue operations to free the abducted students ,_,  Mr ._. 
Olukolade ,_,  a Major General ,_,  said ._. 
With this development ,_,  the Principal of the School confirmed that only 8 of the students are still missing ._. 
One of the terrorists who carried out the attack on the school has also been captured ._. Efforts are underway to locate the remaining 8 students ._. With 14 of the girls escaping on their own ,_,  and 8 still unaccounted for ,_,  it implies the military freed 107 of the kidnapped female students ._. 
Governor of Borno state ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  said on Wednesday said he would give a N50 million reward to any person that gives credible information that would lead to the rescue of all the female students of Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  GGSS ,_,  who were abducted on Monday night by suspected Boko Haram gunmen ._. Governor Shettima had on Wednesday briefed journalist on efforts being made to rescuer the girls from the den of the Boko Haram ._. Mr ._. 
Shettima made the statement before news came that all but eight of the abducted girls had been freed by the military ._. He said 129 students were confirmed by the management of GGSS Chibok as those that registered to sit for the WAEC exams ._. 
He said 50 parents have so far registered the disappearance of their daughters in the school ._. Governor Shettima said that more efforts are being made to ensure that the girls are reunited with their family ,_,  and expressed happiness that some of the girls made it back to town on their own ._. Some of the girls were courageous ._. They were asked to prepare some meal for all of those in the camp but they took advantage of that and bolted away when their captors were not watching and ran back to town; that brought the number to 14 if we add them to the four that were able to escape on Monday night while they were being taking away ._. I have been briefed by both the principal of the school as well as the District of Chibok ._. 
We are glad to receive the news some hours ago that ten of the girls have been able to escape from captivity and made it back to town; and I want to assure the parents of those still at large that government is doing everything possible to ensure that they are rescued in one piece ,_,  said Governor Shettima ._. I want to also make a pledge of N50 million for any information  -_:  relevant and credible information that will lead us to the rescue of these innocent girls ,_,  he said ._. We have given instructions to the security agencies to marshal all resources towards rescuing these innocent girls ._. 
They are our daughters; we are personally distressed and very much touched by this sad episode ._. 
I will go to Chibok and spend a day or two until we make appreciable progress to rescue these kids ._. 
This period called for sober reflections ,_,  it is not for blame games ,_,  he said ._. Abductors pretended to be soldiersPREMIUM TIMES gathered from an official of Chibok local government who spoke to some journalists in Maiduguri that the abductors actually dressed like soldiers when they came to the school; and they pretended to be on a mission to evacuate the students due to an impending attackn in the area ._. According to the source; When they came they told us that they were soldiers and that they have been instructed to evacuate the students from the school immediately because they had a security report that Boko Haram might be attacking the neighbourhood ._. 
No one suspected they were not soldiers until when they were leaving and then some security personnel tried to stop them ,_,  then they began to shoot ._. 
It was then that the girls knew they were in trouble and they began to shout for help ,_,  some even jumped off the lorry ._. Governor Shettima said he would be visiting Chibok town as soon as the security operatives who are still carrying out operation in the area gave him a clearance to do so ._. 
It's about time we admitted it :_:  Nigeria has become a failed state ._. 
For the past 10 years ,_,  the signs of collapse have been visible but the picture has been progressively clearer since 2011 ._. 
About a third of the country's land mass has been under emergency rule for the past one year for reasons that are glaring also in at least another third of the country including the Federal Capital Territory :_:  mass murders ,_,  kidnapping for ransom ,_,  daylight armed robberies ,_,  breakdown of law and order ,_,  and unrestrained stealing of public funds ._. Several authorities identify a failed state as one that can no longer perform its basic duties in such areas as security ,_,  power ,_,  eradication of poverty ,_,  education and job creation ._. 
Even the Nigerian constitution recognises that the reason for government's existence is protection of life and property as well as maintenance of law and order ._. 
Events of the past few years indicate that Nigeria has since exceeded the minimum requirements for classification as a failed state ._. Currently ,_,  the nation is still in grief following the massacre of over 100 people and injuring of more than 200 others by a bomb planted by terrorists in an overcrowded motor park in the nation's capital city on Monday ._. 
On the night of the same Monday ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  which has been working together with international terrorist groups al -_: Shabab and al -_: Qaeda ,_,  seized about 100 female students from a school in Chibok ,_,  near the Sambisa Forest in Borno State ,_,  after shooting dead a soldier and a policeman guarding them ._. 
Meanwhile ,_,  scores of young women abducted in the state since February are yet to be found ._. 
A few weeks ago ,_,  all schools in Borno State were closed; the latest kidnap victims had been recalled to take their senior secondary exams ._. No day has passed in the past weeks without a tale of one horrendous atrocity or the other committed by the bloodthirsty hoodlums ._. 
Is it the mass murder of students in their sleep Is it the kidnap of married and unmarried girls for use as sex slaves and cooks Is it the invasion of military barracks and sack of police stations Mosques ,_,  churches ,_,  villages ,_,  banks and farms have come under the terrorists' fire without challenge from those paid to provide security of life and property ._. After each act of terror ,_,  the Nigerian president ,_,  Dr Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  has made promises that he has never fulfilled ._. 
Time and again ,_,  he has set deadlines for ending the terror threat but he has always defaulted ._. 
The number of Nigerians killed in the Boko Haram war is inching towards 7 ,_,  000 ,_,  and ,_,  with the security situation worsening ,_,  more than one million Nigerians have been forced to live in makeshift camps after they have been sacked by insurgents ._. And so ,_,  we ask again :_:  what is a failed state In this same country ,_,  6 million university graduates applied for 4 ,_,  000 job slots in the Immigration Service ._. 
Almost 800 ,_,  000 of them were invited for an interview during which 23 of them died as a result of stampedes at some centres ._. 
That tragedy of March 15 belies the official figures of the country's unemployment and poverty rates -_: 24 and 70 per cent respectively ._. 
Even though these figures are still very high ,_,  it is known that they were the outcome of guess work ._. 
Common sense dictates that the joblessness rate is closer to 80 per cent while the poverty rate is closer to 95 per cent ._. 
Has a state in which these exist not failed World Bank president Jim Kim did not mince words in declaring ,_,  penultimate week ,_,  that Nigeria is one of the countries where extreme poverty exists ._. Our country has ,_,  in recent years ,_,  always featured on the list of the world's failed or failing states ._. 
In its Failed States Index 2013 released recently ,_,  for instance ,_,  The Fund for Peace FFP ranks the country 16th out of 178 countries ._. 
It is only a few points looking better than war -_: torn Somalia that is ranked first ._. 
So are DR Congo ,_,  the Sudans ,_,  Chad and Afghanistan ._. 
But ,_,  even in these other countries ,_,  innocent people and children don't get killed with the reckless abandon we have seen lately in this country ._. 
And school girls don't get kidnapped in the numbers we have been witnessing in Nigeria ._. 
No wonder the country performed poorly on all indicators used by the FFP :_:  mounting demographic pressure ,_,  movement of refugees or internally displaced persons ,_,  vengeance -_: seeking group grievance ,_,  human flight ,_,  uneven economic development ,_,  poverty or severe economic decline ,_,  legitimacy of the state ,_,  progressive deterioration of services ,_,  violation of human rights ,_,  security apparatus ,_,  rise of factionalised elites and intervention of external actors ._. As the State of Emergency imposed on the three states of Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa expires this Saturday ,_,  President Jonathan should not attempt to extend it ,_,  unless he wishes to extend it to a larger part of the country ._. 
The leaders of the three states have made it clear that they won't welcome an extension ._. 
After all ,_,  the entire nation is in emergency already ,_,  as clearly shown in the war with terrorists in the north ,_,  and the failed amnesty programme in the Niger Delta leading to the militants' resumption of hostilities; armed robbers and kidnappers rule the roost in the south -_: west and the south -_: east ._. 
No doubt ,_,  the theatre of war now covers the entire country ._. The Jonathan regime has demonstrated a frightening incompetence in the handling of the state's affairs ._. 
It is now beyond doubt that the regime is incapable of protecting the people ._. 
This government cannot even protect Nigerians from the next attack or even the following day's attacks ._. 
Before the latest kidnap of school girls in Chibok ,_,  nobody seemed to have been looking for or even as much as discussing those kidnapped earlier ._. 
All Nigerians now live in extreme fear ._. When a state has failed ,_,  it should not be left to be propped up by failed leaders and failed politicians ._. 
But nothing is unstoppable ._. 
This trajectory can still be reversed before it is too late ._. 
That is why statesmen must speak up now !_.

He said he would have been in Chibok by now but for security advice which told him to stay away for now as search -_: and -_: rescue operations launched by the military and vigilantes were ongoing ._. Shettima added that the time calls for sober reflection and should not be used to apportion blame ,_,  insisting that everyone is required to contribute his quota at finding the students and reuniting them with their families ._.

Nyanya attack :_:  Traders ,_,  shoppers desert marketThe after -_: effects of Monday morning's tragedy were painfully obvious at Nyanya Market yesterday ._. The weekly market ,_,  which usually is a beehive of activities with human and vehicle traffic ,_,  looked deserted as many traders and even customers chose the familiar safety of their homes instead of risking a visit to the scene of the tragic attack ._. Speaking to LEADERSHIP ,_,  one of the few traders who opened for business ,_,  Mr Jonathan Mba ,_,  a cloth merchant ,_,  said :_:  There is doubt everywhere; even we that came out here are not so confident ._. 
Business is not flowing as usual but the little we get would make the family happy ._.

Nigerians are now asking :_:  'Would the president have returned so quickly to the soapbox if any of his family members had suffered the fate that befell the victims of the blast ,_,  or if any of his appointees had been a victim'How can a president whose failure of leadership has led to the untimely deaths of 1 ,_, 500 mostly civilians in the hands of terrorists this year alone be so numb to the fate and plight of those who voted him into officeOr how else does one describe the action of a president who was in a celebratory mood in Kano on Tuesday ,_,  even when the surviving victims were still writhing in pain in various hospitals ,_,  the bodies of the victims were still lying cold in the morgue and the fate of dozens of abducted school girls remained unknown APC queriedThe party urged the president ,_,  as a father ,_,  a leader and a human being ,_,  to take a moment of deep introspection ,_,  to reflect on his actions ._. APC said it was imperative for the president to hearken to the voice of reason ,_,  because his aides and party officials ,_,  desperate not to be pushed off the gravy train ,_,  would rather blame everyone but the president and themselves for the woes that had befallen Nigeria under his watch ._. But in reaction to the criticism that has trailed the president's rally in Kano ,_,  the federal government at the end of yesterday's Federal Executive Council FEC meeting said the intention of terrorists was to divide public opinion and once it is achieved ,_,  the terrorists would succeed in feeding their fangs on Nigerian population ._. Speaking to State House correspondents ,_,  the Minister of Information ,_,  Labaran Maku said the president's visit to Kano was a loud statement meant to let the terrorists know that they would not stop the country from moving and from working ._. He said one of the objectives of the terrorists was to paralyse the society to make sure that they keep you and I at home ,_,  frustrate normal activities of society and they will do it again and again ,_,  so that when they strike government stops and everything stops ,_,  then they will be very happy ._. Maku recalled that on the day terrorist struck in Abuja ,_,  the president had cancelled his trip to Ibadan and other engagements ._. He visited the scene personally and directed all the services to provide support ._. 
He appealed to the nation to remain united ._. 
Don't forget that what is happening causes pain to the president of this country more than any other person in this nation today ._. And this president has suffered psychologically as a result of this criminality which terrorists carry out to distract the public ,_,  to disrupt the normal activities of government ,_,  to set people against government ,_,  so that when people die ,_,  whatever the government says is not what people will hear ._. You will notice that whenever there is any significant story something will just come negatively ._. 
So the purpose is to demoralise ,_,  disrupt government and society ,_,  and to set people against each other and create paralysis ._. 
So if we are to say we will do nothing because of the strikes ,_,  then it means that terrorist would have succeeded ,_,  the minister added ._. He noted that politicians are in the habit of exploiting even the darkest moments for political advantage and that should not be the case ._. He advised politicians against exploiting the emotions of citizens for cheap political points ,_,  adding :_:  People will use everything including murder ,_,  including trauma ,_,  like what we have gone through to score cheap political points and this is really very sad ._. Politicians must not exploit the suffering of people just to score cheap political points ._. 
The president is mourning and is already working with everybody and with every institution to ensure that we not only meet the needs of the living and care for those who have survived but continuously work to perfect our security architecture to ensure greater safety of Nigerians ._. The minister said FEC had also observed with regret that in spite of the great media coverage of the Nyanya incident ,_,  it still considered a lot of reports in the last two days very insensitive ._. The council noted and this is very unprofessional that the papers and most of the television stations just unleashed on Nigerians gory details of pictures that should never have been published on the basis of humanity ,_,  on the basis of professional ethics ,_,  and the basis of feelings for the sensibilities of our people ._. We saw on some pages of newspapers the remains of shredded dead bodies printed on the pages of newspapers ._. 
This doesn't happen anywhere in the world because journalism has a responsibility to the sensibility of people ._. Newspapers ,_,  televisions are watched by children and minors and it is expected that in cases like this ,_,  that professional training ,_,  commitment ,_,  should be uppermost in the way we report ._. 
We continue to urge the media that ,_,  yes we expect that whatever happens must be reported ,_,  but in reporting we must show extra care for the psychological health of our citizens and the image of our nation ._. So those gory pictures that were just splashed on the front pages of newspapers and even the inner pages as well as on television screens ,_,  we collectively feel that should never have been the case ,_,  Maku said ._. According to him ,_,  throughout the 9/11 incident in the United States ,_,  there were hardly any gory picture shown of the victims ._. Maku noted that Nyanya pictures as carried by the media ,_,  showed disrespect for the dead and disrespect for the living ,_,  and it showed absolute lack of sensitivity to the health of members of the public ._. We continue to urge that in fighting terror ,_,  all of us have a role to play ._. 
The media is doing a good job but there is a need not to overlook the details of professional commitment ,_,  and in the face of emotions ,_,  just pour out things that minors and even adults who have high sensitivity should not see ,_,  the minister said ._. He reassured Nigerians on the commitment of the federal government to battle and defeat the terrorists ,_,  who have laid siege to the country ,_,  saying :_:  Terrorism is not our tradition ,_,  it is not our philosophy of life in this country ,_,  it is not our way of life ._. 
So what is happening is strange to who we are ._. A number of our children have been indoctrinated into the ideology of terror and they are participating in the terror that is being unleashed on the nation ._. Also ,_,  the PDP yesterday described the statement by the APC portraying the president as heartless for not shutting down governance over the terrorist attack in Abuja ,_,  as yet another demonstration of APC's support for the terrorist agenda against the country ._. National Publicity Secretary of the party ,_,  Chief Olisa Metuh ,_,  in a statement ,_,  said :_:  It is common knowledge that those behind the attacks seek to impose a reign of terror on our country ,_,  cow the president ,_,  dictate the tempo of government and ultimately shut down governance ,_,  a plot which the APC has betrayed its support for ._. Stating that the PDP -_: led federal government would not in anyway be cowed or intimidated into abandoning its mandate ,_,  the party stressed that Jonathan remained committed to the welfare and security of all Nigerians ._. Indeed ,_,  Nigerians are no longer at loss as to the agenda of the APC ._. 
The APC has again exposed its support for acts directly aimed at shutting down governance and imposing anarchy and reign of terror on our people ._. 
They had expected the president to be intimidated by acts of terrorism which have continued to be motivated by their utterances ._. However ,_,  we wish to restate that as a party vested with the sacred mandate freely given by over 160 million Nigerians ,_,  the leadership of the PDP and the government we formed shall not be cowed ,_,  intimidated ,_,  harassed or tele -_: guided by acts of terrorism ._. The PDP -_: led administration was popularly elected by the Nigerian people and shall never allow terrorists and their supporters to dictate the tempo of government ,_,  which has been their direct objective ._. It is a globally settled principle that no government allows terrorists to influence the course of its action otherwise they have achieved their purpose ._. 
This is why the Conservative Party continued with its convention in Brighton ,_,  in October of 1984 ,_,  even though the then Prime Minister ,_,  Margaret Thatcher ,_,  was almost killed by an IRA bomb that exploded at the venue of the convention ._.

Addressing journalists ,_,  who accompanied them to the National Hospital ,_,  the Chairman of the APC Governors Forum and the Imo State Governor ,_,  Chief Rochas Okorocha ,_,  said every Nigerian must resolve to join hands with government to fight and defeat terrorism in the country ._. As part of our concern ,_,  we have decided to establish a trust fund by the APC governors to support the families of the victims of this unholy act ._. 
We shall also join forces with other democrats to ensure that this bad story ends as quickly as possible ._. 
We pray for the deceased and the families that lost their loved ones in the incident ,_,  he said ._. 
Okorocha urged the president to rise up to the challenge and show leadership by employing all devices within his ability to arrest terrorism in the country ._. According to him ,_,  the APC governors believe that this should not be the time to play politics or apportion blames ,_,  adding that all hands must be on deck to ensure the safety of lives and property ._. This is not the time to talk politics with people's lives ._. 
We appeal to all Nigerians ,_,  irrespective of political party affiliations ,_,  to come together and unite to fight this evil of the moment which has terrorised our nation ._. We also want to request Mr ._. 
President and Commander -_: in -_: Chief of the Armed Forces to defend that particular part of our constitution which guarantees the safety of lives and property of the ordinary people ._. 
We urge him to show leadership at this moment and do whatever it is within his capacity as the president to fish out those who are involved in this act ._. Just as we were talking about what happened in Nyanya a few hours ago ,_,  we also learnt that about 100 young girls were kidnapped ._. 
A nation cannot live like this ._. 
While we urge all Nigerians to remain calm and prayerful ,_,  we pray that all will unite to fight this crime ,_,  he added ._. The Nasarawa State governor ,_,  Tanko Al -_: Makura ,_,  also admonished Nigerians to be vigilant and observant of all that happens around them ,_,  as a means of assisting the security forces to checkmate the activities of the terrorists ._. 
The supervising Minister of Education ,_,  Chief Nyesom Wike ,_,  Wednesday shed more light on the circumstances surrounding the abduction of 129 female students from a government secondary school in Chibok ,_,  Borno State in the early hours of Tuesday ._. He said Boko Haram insurgents ,_,  suspected to be behind the abduction ,_,  overpowered the security team attached to the school before taking the schoolgirls away ._. He added that a soldier and a policeman died in the incident while the number of those abducted is yet to be determined ._. Wike ,_,  in the statement by his Special Assistant ,_,  Media ,_,  Mr ._. 
Simeon Nwakaudu ,_,  condemned the abduction of the schoolgirls ,_,  describing the action of the terrorists as barbaric and ungodly ._. According to him ,_,  the ministry is working with security agencies to ensure the rescue of the girls and to provide tighter security in all educational institutions in the North -_: east ._. The action of the terrorists ,_,  he said ,_,  was following a growing trend of terrorists hitting at soft targets ,_,  which the federal government is aware of and that was why it had been doing everything possible to protect women ,_,  children and other vulnerable groups and institutions ,_,  including schools ._. The nation will not succumb to the plots by terrorists to deny children their right to education ,_,  he stated ._. Wike said that the government feels for the families of the abducted girls over their anxiety for the safety of their children ,_,  stressing that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the children come to no harm and are reunited with their families ,_,  the statement added ._. 
There is this story of a cowboy who had a serious accident with his vehicle in which he was carrying a dog and a horse ._. 
Not long after ,_,  a police officer who happened to be an animal lover came upon the scene ._. 
He saw the horse first and realizing the serious nature of its injuries ,_,  he drew his service revolver and put the animal out of its misery ._. 
Walking around ,_,  he also found the dog critically injured ._. 
He couldn't bear to hear it whine in pain ,_,  so he ended the dog's suffering as well ._. 
Finally ,_,  he located the cowboy who had suffered multiple fractures and was battling for survival ._. 
Hey are you okay the cop asked ._. 
The cowboy took one look at the smoking revolver in the trooper's hand and mustered :_:  Never felt better !_. The moral of the story is that however difficult the circumstance a man may find himself ,_,  the guiding philosophy remains that once there is life there is hope ._. 
That explains why many of the poor people in our country would keep on believing that they can still score a great victory in life despite the odds placed against them by a succession of governments that have been unable to mobilise the nation's potentials in advancement of the public good ._. 
Unfortunately ,_,  that flicker of hope is also being gradually taken away from them by the manner in which some serial murderers seem to be gaining control of our country with the vulnerable of our society becoming sitting targets for extermination ._. Nobody has put the Monday tragedy at Nyanyan a suburb of Abuja in perspective for me as Member Feese ,_,  the young lady who survived the United Nations office bombing two years ago ._. 
In a message to her friends in TeamMember and the Board of Trustees members of which I am one that serves as a reminder of the task that still lies ahead ,_,  Member wrote :_:   ._. two and a half years ago ,_,  I was at the mercy of all Nigerians of goodwill who rallied to ensure that I got the help I needed in order to be alive today and tell my story ._. 
I was lucky to survive albeit with severe disabilities ._. 
On the 26 of August 2011 it was you ,_,  my family and friends ,_,  who were running around looking for me not knowing whether I was dead or alive ._. 
I heard that my Dad had to go into the morgue looking for me there ._. 
When finally he found me in the intensive care unit of the National Hospital he could not recognize me due to the severity of the injuries I suffered ._. 
I was lucky !_. 
I am still alive !_. As I watched with difficulty on television the report of the pain and suffering of those affected by the Nyanyan bombing as well as the agony of those families who lost members in this unnecessary act of hatred ,_,  it calls to memory what we have been through ._. 
Unfortunately not much lessons have been learnt in caring for the wounded ._. 
As for the families of the dead and injured ,_,  my prayer is that the government and indeed all Nigerians will remember them not just in prayers but also to support and counsel them ._. 
It is going to be a hard and long journey ._. 
We should know; as we have been travelling on this road for the past two years ._. I would love to hold someone's hand and just say to him or her that 'God willing ,_,  it will be all right' ._. Despite those moving words from Member ,_,  I still cannot come to terms with the fact that some people would sit down to plot the Nyanyan mayhem that has now subjected hundreds of innocent families to anguish with scars that may never heal ._. 
But it fits perfectly into a pattern of violence that is gradually making our country a living hell as several people are killed ,_,  villages are razed and innocent female students are abducted ostensibly to turn them into sex slaves ._. However ,_,  the bigger tragedy is that at a time the body bags were still being counted on Monday ,_,  the Peoples Democratic Party PDP decided to play politics with the carnage ._. 
In a statement made public shortly after the bomb exploded and signed by National Publicity Secretary Olisa Metuh ,_,  the PDP put the blame on some unpatriotic persons ,_,  especially those in the APC ,_,  who have been making utterances and comments ,_,  promoting violence and blood -_: letting as a means of achieving political control ._. Their hearts have been hardened and they are embittered by the fact that they have been rejected by the people ._. Like most reasonable Nigerians ,_,  I found it difficult to understand how the PDP could make that statement at such a tragic moment ._. 
When a terrorist attack happens ,_,  citizens of most countries band together not only to grieve the dead and offer support to injured victims but also to send a message to the perpetrators that violence cannot ,_,  and will not ,_,  defeat their societies ._. 
But in Nigeria after every horrendous attack ,_,  political leaders are always eager to exploit the situation to make unfounded allegations that can only help to compromise whatever efforts the security agencies may be making in the bid to unravel what happened and why ._. Projecting a persecution complex of the terrorists are killing people because some opposition politicians are bent on making the country ungovernable for President Jonathan has become a perfect alibi for the inability to seek a multi -_: partisan and whole of society solution to the growing insecurity in the nation ._. 
But the cynical attempt to politically exploit such a monumental tragedy is not only unconscionable ,_,  it betrays a mindset that has made tackling the Boko Haram insurgency rather difficult ._. Unfortunately ,_,  the counter -_: narrative from the opposition is no better ._. 
In the last one year ,_,  there has been a rationalization of the violence by those who would argue that the Boko Haram insurgents are killing because of poverty ._. 
As the argument goes ,_,  it is because of the hopelessness in the Northeast that some misguided young men are carrying bombs and AK -_: 47 to kill defenceless Nigerians and abduct innocent girls about 130 female students were reportedly taken captive at a Government Girls School in Chibok in Adamawa State on Monday ._. 
And according to this self -_: serving logic ,_,  that is because the Federal Government under President Jonathan is not providing jobs !_. While I will not dispute the fact that we have a huge population of those who live on the margin of society that may have provided a recruiting ground for Boko Haram ,_,  I deplore the not -_: so -_: subtle attempt to rationalize ,_,  sometimes even glorify ,_,  the bestiality being perpetrated by the insurgents on the pretext that the Federal Government has failed to meet certain expectations ._. 
Now the question :_:  Do those politicians who are ever quick to argue that the insurgents are killing because of poverty really care about the poor No ,_,  they don't !_. 
The real motive behind their narrative is to blame President Jonathan for the calamities that daily befall our country so they can use that to mobilize the people against him ._. The foundation for the crisis we have today in the North was laid over a long period of time by political office holders from the region who have been shirking their responsibilities :_:  the Governors who never paid attention to education ,_,  including those who introduced political Sharia while helping themselves to public treasuries ._. 
In some of these states also ,_,  secondary schools have in recent past been closed for several months due to disagreement between the authorities and the teachers; in a few others ,_,  students are taught under the tree and then you hear about primary school teachers who fail some elementary examination that is meant for primary four pupils !_. Situations like the foregoing can only provide fertile grounds for Boko Haram and allied forces and Borno which serves as the epicentre of the insurgency is a classic example ._. 
In 2006 ,_,  while receiving a team of broadcasters to his state ,_,  then Governor Ali Modu Sheriff said he was not concerned about the criticism of his administration in the print media because 95 percent of the people in Borno State could not read and write ._. 
And perhaps to rub it in ,_,  Sheriff added that less than two percent of Borno residents had access to newspapers !_. 
Even while the statistics reeled out by the governor may be false ,_,  the mindset that informed such disclosure is very telling of the kind of leadership that has led us to the current crisis ._. We are at a rather challenging moment in our history and it is one that calls for a multi -_: partisan leadership which only Major General Muhammadu Buhari rtd ,_,  seems to appreciate ._. 
In describing the Nyanyan attack as horrific ,_,  heartbreaking ,_,  and a cruel act of merciless slaughter ,_,  Buhari on Tuesday called for a broad based ,_,  non -_: partisan coalition to fight the scourge before he added :_:  The security and stability of Nigeria is inviolable ._. 
Our security and stability cannot be conditioned on any ideology or partisan agenda ._. 
Every Nigerian reserves the right to his own security ,_,  to his own freedom and dignity ,_,  and no amount of terrorist blackmail can make us surrender these ._. I agree completely with the General ._. 
As matters stand now ,_,  we have four and a half explanations competing for primacy on the Boko Haram scourge ._. 
One is the social responsibility explanation :_:  long standing neglect by northern governors ._. 
The second is the assertion that Boko Haram continues to fester because the federal government seems clueless as far as national security is concerned ._. 
The third explanation the PDP narrative is that Boko Haram is the military wing of some political group that is intent on seizing power through sporadic acts of terror meant to frighten President Jonathan out of Aso Rock ._. 
The fourth explanation the APC narrative is that the terror acts are being perpetrated not by Boko Haram but rather by some rogue security agents with a sinister political agenda ._. 
The remaining half theory is the one that seeks a religious explanation for Boko Haram ,_,  based on the logic that adherents of the terror group are so foolish as to imagine that our country can be bombed into adopting a sectarian polity in place of the present secular order ._. The solution to the current terror upsurge must be sought among the possibilities opened up by those foregoing explanations ._. 
While we should not dismiss any of them ,_,  what ought to worry most Nigerians is that the current approach is not working because there is no unity of purpose ._. 
That means things are likely to get worse before they begin to get better ._. 
We need ,_,  however ,_,  to join the patriots who insist that the will of the Nigerian nation must not be dissolved by the incendiary madness of some demented gangsters ._. While I commiserate with the families of the dead and pray for quick recovery for the injured ,_,  I wish all Nigerians a happy Easter ._. 
The Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Continuing Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges to in the North and Minister of Special Duties/Inter Governmental Affairs ,_,  Alhaji Kabiru Tanimu Turaki SAN ,_,  Wednesday reiterated his call to Boko Haram insurgents to embrace dialogue ,_,  which the federal government has re -_: opened ._. The minister ,_,  during a visit to victims of the Monday bomb blast in Nyanya in hospitals where they are receiving treatment ,_,  said the federal government was committed to ending terrorism in Nigeria ._. He assured repentant members of the terrorist groups that the federal government was genuinely committed to listening to them and honestly finding solutions to their grievances ._. Turaki however warned those who are unrepentant would face the wrath of security agents ._. For those members of the insurgency that are willing to give peace a chance ,_,  government has created an opportunity for them through the Presidential Committee on Continuing Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of the Security Challenges in the North  ,_,  which President ,_,  Goodluck Jonathan has inaugurated and which is working ,_,  and I have the privilege of chairing ,_,  he said ._. According to him ,_,  since the reconstitution of the presidential committee ,_,  some of the insurgents have been talking to it and urged those still perpetuating violence to have a change of heart ._. For those who think that they don't want to give peace a chance ,_,  who think that they can imprison our collective resolve; for those of them who think that violence pays ,_,  then the security agencies are to deal with them ._. I want to assure Nigerians that the government does not only have the capacity to deal with them but indeed the government has the will power to ensure that the lives and property of all Nigerians are well protected ,_,  he added ._. Turaki commended the management and staff of the hospitals where the victims were being treated for their dedication and prompt attention to the patients ._. 
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has summoned his National Security Council to a Thursday meeting in Abuja ,_,  after suspected militants carried out a string of deadly attacks and abducted more than 100 school girls ._. A presidential adviser said Jonathan will review security measures and operations with a view of determining the best way forward ._. In a Wednesday statement ,_,  adviser Reuben Abati said the president was particularly concerned about Monday's mass kidnapping of girls attending a secondary school in the northeastern Borno state region ._. Abati said Jonathan has ordered security forces to deploy maximum efforts toward rescuing the girls ._. Late Wednesday ,_,  Nigeria's Joint Information Center said only eight of the abducted students were still missing ._. 
In a statement ,_,  defense director Major General Chris Olukolade also said one of the terrorists who carried out the school attack had been captured ._. There were no initial claims of responsibility ,_,  but the assault is similar to attacks that have been carried out by the Boko Haram Islamist militant group ._. The incident took place on the same day a bomb ripped through a crowded bus station in Abuja ,_,  killing at least 75 people ._. On Wednesday ,_,  The Associated Press reported that gunmen attacked a village in northeastern Nigeria's Gwoza district ,_,  killing at least 18 people ._. The government of the Borno state region announced it was offering a reward of about $300 ,_, 000 for information leading to the rescue of the abducted school girls ._. In a VOA Hausa service interview ,_,  Nigerian Union of Teachers chairman Dauda Maina pleaded for the students' safe return and for the government to improve school security ._. We are very saddened and we totally condemn the abduction of those school children ,_,  and we are begging the government to help the people ._. 
Our advice is that security measures must be improved ._. 
All those schools needed to be fenced so that there will be an entrance and an exit into the school as opposed to how they are just open buildings in the middle of nowhere ,_,  said Maina ._. Also ,_,  an unidentified parent in the region urged the kidnappers to free the girls ._. 
We ,_,  the parents ,_,  are really shocked ._. 
Please ,_,  please ,_,  please have mercy ._. 
Be merciful and release those children ._. The abductions also were condemned by United Nations Secretary -_: General Ban Ki -_: moon's office ._. 
FOR years South Africa has asserted itself as Africa's most dominant economy ,_,  frequently being touted as the world's gateway into Africa ._. 
However ,_,  its anaemic growth in recent times has seen other African countries rise to the pinnacle of the continent's economic landscape ._. 
At a time when six of the world's ten fastest growing economies in the last decade have been in Africa averaging around 7 percent GDP growth ,_,  South Africa has only managed a miserly GDP growth rate of around 3 ._. 9 percent over the same comparable period ._. 
The growing inequalities between the rich and the poor ,_,  labour unrests ,_,  service delivery protests and corruption among a range of other ills have hampered South Africa's progress ._. Enter Nigeria ,_,  Africa's most populous country with over 160 million people and whose GDP has grown at an average of 6 percent since 2006 according to the World Bank ._. 
Nigeria's rapid growth over the years appears to have attracted noteworthy foreign investments as witnessed by global giant Procter & Gamble's recent $300 million manufacturing plant ,_,  the Dubai -_: like Eko Atlantic City being built on land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean among other foreign investments ._. Nigeria's Statistics Bureau ,_,  on the 6th of April ,_,  announced its revised GDP figures which estimated the size of Nigeria's economy to around $510 billion ,_,  reflecting an 89 percent increase in the size of its GDP ._. 
This came after the process of recalculating Nigeria's Gross Domestic Product to better reflect the country's changing economic configuration over the years ._. 
The recalculation ,_,  called rebasing ,_,  accounted for changes in market prices and weights of goods and services ,_,  and also saw the base year of GDP calculation change from 1990 to 2010 ._. Nigeria's mobile telecoms industry as well as the entertainment and filmmaking sectors saw their weighting increase ,_,  in tandem with their significant contribution to Nigeria's economic output ._. 
The last rebasing exercise in the West African country was carried out some two decades ago in 1990 ._. 
Nigeria's GDP rebasing saw it climb to 24th position on the list of the World's biggest economies by GDP ,_,  ahead of countries such as Belgium and Taiwan ._. The country has set itself an ambitious target of becoming one of the world's top 20 economies by 2020 and has been second only to China in terms of cumulative real GDP growth in local currency terms since 2008 ._. 
Jim O'Neill ,_,  economist at Goldman Sachs and famous for coining the acronym BRIC ,_,  has now shifted attention to what he terms the MINTs ,_,  Mexico ,_,  Indonesia ,_,  Nigeria and Turkey which he sees as the pillars of global growth in the coming years ,_,  with Nigeria being the most prominent among them ._. Accounting for $5 ,_, 5 billion of the Foreign Direct Investment into Africa in 2013 alone ,_,  clearly Nigeria is in good stead to be one of the leading economies with time ._. 
On the surface this makes for some scintillating reading ._. 
However ,_,  a closer look at the dynamics of Nigeria's economy reveals structural deficiencies that are overlooked by GDP figures as indicators of economic growth and development ._. Military Extremism in the NorthNigeria has had to contend with threats posed by Boko Haram as well as other Islamist militant groups for a while ._. 
The Muslim North has been the area most affected by the activities of these extremists ,_,  perhaps the most antagonistic of them being Boko Haram ._. 
It is estimated that since 2002 ,_,  the group which has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by most foreign governments ,_,  has accounted for over 10 ,_, 000 deaths in the region ._. Often ,_,  it is argued that the unemployment ,_,  lack of education opportunities ,_,  poverty and socio -_: economic inequalities rife in the northern parts of the country provide a steady supply of youths who can be recruited into the radical organisation ._. 
The consequences of such extremism on the country have been all too apparent ,_,  ranging from kidnappings ,_,  bombings and assassinations ._. 
In May 2013 ,_,  the Nigerian President declared a State of Emergency on three states in the northern parts of the country as part of efforts to thwart insurgents ._. This could potentially be a self -_: perpetuating cycle where the northern parts of Nigeria ,_,  because of the instability ,_,  fail to attract investment thereby further entrenching roots of income inequalities and under development compared to the oil rich south ._. 
This extremism is more than just about religious pursuits to impose Sharia Law ._. 
Commenting on Boko Haram and their activities ,_,  Femi Odekunle Professor of Criminology at the University of Abuja says ,_,  The government needs to address the social order issues which constitute economic and educational issues that are underlying the emergence and sustenance of Boko Haram ._. As long as wealth and opportunities remain or are perceived to be concentrated in the Southern states with the oil refineries ,_,  it is not immediately conceivable how the terror caused by militant groups in the North will abate ._. 
The costs of such insurgents on the economy are too dear ,_,  and could all but reverse strides made in developing Nigeria ._. Corruption ,_,  'the in elephant room'Recently ,_,  Nigeria has made the headlines with high profile cases of corruption ._. 
From allegations by former Central Bank governor Lamido Sanusi of $20 billion being unaccounted for by the State ,_,  to senior government ministers being sacked ,_,  reportedly for corruption ._. 
Clearly corruption is rampant in Nigeria ._. 
Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index ranks Nigeria at 144 out of the 177 countries measured ,_,  underlining the extent to which corruption is endemic in Nigeria ._. Nigeria's Finance Minister ,_,  Ngozi Okonjo -_: Iweala who in her book 'Reforming the Unreformable :_:  Lessons from Nigeria' ,_,  dedicated an entire chapter to corruption ,_,  concedes that Nigeria indeed has a problem with corruption ._. 
However ,_,  she like other members of President Goodluck Jonathan's government ,_,  with haste ,_,  downplays the problem ._. 
Speaking to Christiane Amanpour ,_,  CNN's chief international correspondent ,_,  Dr Okonjo -_: Iweala says Nigeria does have a problem with corruption and so do many other countries ,_,  including developed countries ._. To be fair ,_,  corruption is not only peculiar to Nigeria ,_,  and notable strides have been made to try to stamp out graft in that country ._. 
Yet ,_,  corruption could see incomes remain unevenly distributed in a country where the World Bank estimates that 67% of the population still live in poverty ._. 
Former Executive Chairman of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ,_,  Nuhu Riabadu revealed that since independence in 1960 ,_,  Nigeria has lost close to $380 billion to corruption and mismanagement ._. 
Corruption then is the 'elephant in the room' which the country has to address if these statistics are anything to go by ._. Structural Economic IssuesOn a broader level ,_,  Nigeria's economy is laden with structural issues that threaten the growth it has been witnessing ._. 
80 percent of the country's revenues come from crude oil exports and this signifies an undiversified economy reliant on the oil and gas sectors that are susceptible to the caprices of fluctuating commodity prices ._. 
This speaks to the obvious need to diversify Nigeria's economy ._. Furthermore ,_,  growth in the Nigerian economy has been in less labour intensive sectors such as oil and gas ,_,  telecoms and banking ._. 
As a result ,_,  not everyone enjoys the growth of the economy as most people remain unemployed ._. 
Agriculture ,_,  which can potentially employ many people ,_,  needs to be modernised and more employment opportunities created ._. 300 ,_, 000 barrels of oil were reportedly lost in 2013 alone due to vandalism ,_,  production shut -_: downs and theft ._. 
These are the sort of leakages that will need to be addressed ,_,  as the country endeavours to develop ._. 
But the work does not stop there; together with Afghanistan and Pakistan ,_,  Nigeria remains one of only three countries where Polio is still present ._. 
Then there is the 'paradox of plenty' ,_,  where an estimated 120 million people do not have access to electricity in Nigeria which is the largest oil exporter on the continent ._. The clear implication is that investments have to be made in shoring up health care systems ,_,  ensuring efficient service delivery ,_,  upgrading key infrastructure in the country ,_,  propping up systems as well as ensuring that growth and development is equal ._. 
Nigeria's demographic structure presents opportunities for an economy driven by robust domestic demand ._. 
Yet this hinges upon a growing middle class whose spending will drive the economy ._. Though South Africa will likely remain the bell -_: weather economy in Africa for the foreseeable future due to its diversification ,_,  investments in infrastructure ,_,  its size and the systems it has in place ,_,  it is obvious that it has underwhelmed of late ._. 
With Nigeria's national elections looming in 2015 ,_,  it remains to be seen whether the new government will implement the much -_: needed socio -_: economic reforms and consolidate its new found position as Africa's biggest economy ._. In the mean time however ,_,  for the ordinary man walking the streets of Lagos or Abuja ,_,  there is very little to cheer about as ,_,  despite the GDP rebasing exercise ,_,  the standards of living still pale in comparison to other developed economies ._. 
Members of the Boko Haram sect have attacked a village ,_,  Sabon -_: Kasuawa in Hawul local government of Borno state killing the local chief ,_,  district head and his guard ._. Hawul local government is about 210 kilometres south of Maiduguri ,_,  the Borno state capital ._. A politician from Hawul Local Government ,_,  Hyeldi Bwala ,_,  who spoke to journalists on phone ,_,  alleged the gunmen attacked the district head shortly after he returned home from the mosque where he had gone to observe the night prayer at about 7 :_: 30 p ._. m on Tuesday ._. They simply walked right into the palace of the monarch and shot him in his bedroom ._. 
And on their way out they also shot at his guard before fleeing away into the dark night ,_,  said Mr ._. 
Bwala ._. 
Following the worsening security situation across Nigeria ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan has summoned members of the National Security Council to a meeting on Thursday at the Presidential Villa ,_,  Abuja ._. This was disclosed by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity ,_,  Reuben Abati ._. The meeting ,_,  which will be presided over by President Jonathan ,_,  is scheduled for 11 :_: 00 a ._. m ._. Those expected at the meeting include Vice President Namadi Sambo ,_,  the Minister of Defence ,_,  Lt ._.  -_: Gen Aliyu Gusau rtd; the National Security Adviser ,_,  Col ._. 
Sambo Dasuki rtd; the Chief of Defence Staff ,_,  Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh; the Service Chiefs ,_,  the Inspector -_: General of Police ,_,  the Director -_: General of the State Security Services and the Director -_: General of National Intelligence Agency ._. The meeting of the National Security Council will be followed at 1300 Hours by an enlarged meeting on security developments in the country to which President Jonathan has invited state governors ._. President Jonathan ,_,  members of the National Security Council and the state governors will review the security situation in the country as well as ongoing national security measures and operations with a view to determining the best way forward ._. President Jonathan reassures all Nigerians and persons living in the country that the Federal Government remains very mindful of its responsibility for the safety of their lives and properties in all parts of Nigeria and will continue to do everything possible to protect them from the scourge of terrorism and insecurity ._. The President is particularly concerned about the plight of the young Senior Secondary School girls who were reportedly abducted from their school in Borno State on Monday night and has ordered the military and national security agencies to deploy maximum efforts towards rescuing all of the girls and returning them safely to their parents ._. 
He welcomes reports that the military and security agencies have already rescued some of the girls Mr ._. 
Abati said ._. It added that President Jonathan deeply regrets the pain ,_,  sorrow and anguish brought upon many Nigerian families in recent days as a consequence of recurring security challenges which the nation is contending with ._. The President remains convinced that with the patriotic commitment and support of all Nigerians ,_,  the country will ultimately overcome its present challenges and move forward in unity and strength ._. In this regard ,_,  President Jonathan will be pleased to see all politicians in the country exhibiting greater responsibility and patriotism by doing more to support his administration's sincere efforts to enhance national security rather than trying to build political capital out of the pain and misery of their compatriots ._. 
The Nigerian military on Wednesday said some of the female students abducted by suspected Boko Haram gunmen have been freed ._. Over 100 final year students of the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok ,_,  Borno State ,_,  were kidnapped from their school on Monday night ._. 
Two security officials attached to the school were also killed during the attack ._. 
The girls were kidnapped days after they resumed school to prepare for the final examinations which was scheduled to start next week ._. 
All schools in Borno had been closed before then ._. PREMIUM TIMES had reported how the girls ,_,  largely teenagers ,_,  were put in a lorry by the terrorists and how some of them escaped by holding on to branches of trees from the moving lorry ,_,  and others by jumping from the vehicle ._. In a statement by the Director of Defence Information ,_,  Chris Olukolade on Wednesday ,_,  the military said that some of the girls were freed on Wednesday after troops pursued the terrorists into their den ._. Mr ._. 
Olukolade ,_,  a Major General ,_,  confirmed that the number of girls kidnapped was 129 ._. 
He did not state how many of the girls were freed by the military ._. 
It is also not clear if the freed girls are same as those who had escaped from their abductors ._. Several Nigerians have condemned the kidnap and asked the federal government to urgently ensure their prompt release ._. Taraba violenceArms recovered in WukariThe spokesperson also said that troops deployed to restore law and order in Wukari ,_,  Taraba State ,_,  have apprehended 14 armed men who were involved in the violence in the area from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning ._. The police had earlier confirmed that seven people died from the violence ,_,  although residents said the casualty was more ._. Mr ._. 
Olukolade said the fighting led to the burning of no fewer than 25 houses and displacement of over 200 persons ._. The troops ,_,  Mr ._. 
Olukolade said ,_,  also captured a building where arms were being fabricated ._. He said that four locally fabricated machine guns ,_,  one sub machine gun ,_,  four single barrel guns and 21 live cartridges were recovered in the process ._. He ,_,  however ,_,  noted that normalcy has since been restored as troops maintain patrol of the area ._. He said that security forces have also been directed to continue with the offensive on all terrorist enclaves around Nigeria ._. 
The Nigerian military has confirmed that it has freed majority of the 129 female students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State ._. The students were kidnapped on Monday night by suspected Boko Haram members ._. In a statement on Wednesday evening ,_,  the spokesperson of the Defence Headquarters ,_,  DHQ ,_,  Chris Olukolade ,_,  confirmed that only 8 of the girls were still held captive by the soldiers ._. Of the 129 kidnapped students ,_,  the Borno State Governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  earlier in the day confirmed that 14 of the girls escaped from their abductors ._. More students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok have been freed this evening in the on -_: going search and rescue operations to free the abducted students ,_,  Mr ._. 
Olukolade ,_,  a Major General ,_,  said ._. 
With this development ,_,  the Principal of the School confirmed that only 8 of the students are still missing ._. 
One of the terrorists who carried out the attack on the school has also been captured ._. Efforts are underway to locate the remaining 8 students ._. With 14 of the girls escaping on their own ,_,  and 8 still unaccounted for ,_,  it implies the military freed 107 of the kidnapped female students ._. 
It's tempting to dismiss Boko Haram and its brutal ,_,  public atrocities as an aberration ,_,  a temporary road -_: block on Nigeria's slow but inexorable upward trajectory ._. 
This is ,_,  after all ,_,  Africa's largest economy and a thriving ,_,  if dysfunctional ,_,  democracy ._. 
But the violence keeps coming ,_,  and Nigeria's leaders  -_:  despite their bullish ,_,  near -_: farcical declarations to the contrary  -_:  are powerless to stop it ._. At the beginning of this year ,_,  Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said that it's only a matter of time before his government defeats Islamist militant group Boko Haram ._. 
Boko Haram insurgency is a temporary challenge ._. We will surely overcome Boko Haram ._. Even then ,_,  in January ,_,  these bold words rang hollow and it didn't help the tense sectarian atmosphere that the president was speaking from a Church of Christ pulpit ._. 
Having abandoned any form of diplomacy ,_,  Jonathan's administration was eight months into an all -_: out military offensive against Boko Haram in its northern strongholds ._. 
Three states were ,_,  and remain ,_,  under a State of Emergency ,_,  with curfews in place and cellphone signals interrupted to disrupt communications ._. 
The army was out in force ,_,  hunting the militants down ,_,  while air force bombers harassed them from the air ._. The offensive was Jonathan's big gesture ,_,  a ._. 
Disturbed by the avalanche of security challenges facing the country as a result of the activities of the terrorist Boko Haram sect ,_,  President Goodluck Jonathan has summoned members of the National Security Council ,_,  including the 36 state governors ,_,  to an emergency meeting billed for today at 11 am ._. The decision to summon the meeting Wednesday preceded the announcement by the Defence Headquarters DHQ last night that 121 of the female students abducted from the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok in Borno State on Monday night ,_,  had been freed by the military ._. With this development ,_,  the principal of the school confirmed that only eight of the students were still missing but efforts were underway to locate them ,_,  said the DHQ spokesman ,_,  Major -_: General Chris Olukolade ._. One of the terrorists who carried out the attack on the school was also captured ,_,  he added ._. However ,_,  the girls' abduction has elicited global outrage with the former British Prime Minister and UN Special Envoy for Global Education ,_,  Mr ._. 
Gordon Brown ,_,  UNICEF and China condemning their kidnapping and calling for their immediate release ._. The Borno State Governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  also promised to give N50 million to anyone with information that could lead to the whereabouts of the remaining abducted students ._. Notice of the meeting of the National Security Council ,_,  which will be presided over by the president ,_,  was contained in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity ,_,  Dr ._.  Reuben Abati ._. Those expected at the meeting include Vice -_: President Namadi Sambo; Minister of Defence ,_,  Lt ._.  -_: Gen Aliyu Gusau rtd; National Security Adviser ,_,  Col ._. 
Sambo Dasuki rtd ._. ; Chief of Defence Staff ,_,  Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh; other service chiefs; Inspector -_: General of Police IG Mohammed Abubakar; Director -_: General of the State Security Services; and the Director -_: General of National Intelligence Agency ._. The meeting ,_,  according to the statement ,_,  would be followed at 1 pm by an enlarged meeting on security developments in the country to which the president invited the 36 state governors ._. President Jonathan ,_,  members of the National Security Council and the state governors will review the security situation in the country as well as ongoing national security measures and operations with a view to determining the best way forward ._. President Jonathan reassures all Nigerians and persons living in the country that the federal government remains very mindful of its responsibility for the safety of their lives and properties in all parts of Nigeria and will continue to do everything possible to protect them from the scourge of terrorism and insecurity ._. The president is particularly concerned about the plight of the young senior secondary school girls who were reportedly abducted from their school in Borno State on Monday night and has ordered the military and national security agencies to deploy maximum efforts towards rescuing all the girls and returning them safely to their parents ._. He welcomes reports that the military and security agencies have already rescued some of the girls ._. President Jonathan deeply regrets the pain ,_,  sorrow and anguish brought upon many Nigerian families in recent days as a consequence of recurring security challenges which the nation is contending with ._. The president remains convinced that with the patriotic commitment and support of all Nigerians ,_,  the country will ultimately overcome its present challenges and move forward in unity and strength ._. In this regard ,_,  President Jonathan will be pleased to see all politicians in the country exhibiting greater responsibility and patriotism by doing more to support his administration's sincere efforts to enhance national security rather than trying to build political capital out of the pain and misery of their compatriots ,_,  the statement concluded ._. 
Meanwhile ,_,  DHQ confirmed last night that 121 of the 129 girls who were abducted Monday night were freed by troops who closed in on the den of those believed to have carried out the attack on the school ._. The DHQ spokesman ,_,  Olukolade maintained that a total of 129 students were abducted by a group of terrorists ._. He however assured Nigerians that the security forces were working together with the locals to ensure that all the students regained their freedom ._. A security source disclosed to THISDAY that some of the abductors are well known to the members of the community who were making frantic efforts yesterday to ensure that the girls were freed ._. However ,_,  before news of the 121 girls who had regained their freedom broke ,_,  the Borno State governor ,_,  Shettima ,_,  had at a press briefing earlier yesterday promised to give N50 million to anyone with information that might lead to the whereabouts of the students ._. The governor said his government was willing to do everything to ensure that the female students were reunited with their families ._. He said he had been in constant touch with the principal of the school and the leaders of Chibok and had got everyone involved in the search of the students ._. The governor ,_,  who was in a pensive mood at the press briefing ,_,  said :_:  The Commissioner for Education has been in constant touch with the school and the people of the town ._. 
I have also been speaking to the principal and the district head of Chibok on an hourly basis ._. Shettima while making a pledge of N50 million for anyone with information that could lead to the freedom of the abducted students from the Boko Haram enclave ,_,  said he was uncertain of the precise number of girls who were kidnapped ._. 
He said the school had even opened a register for parents to come and give information about their missing wards ,_,  stressing that so far ,_,  parents had complained of 50 missing students ._. He said he would have travelled to Chibok yesterday but for security reports which advised him to stay away ,_,  as military operations were ongoing to comb the area for the insurgents ._. He said :_:  I want to go to Chibok but was advised against it because of military operations going on around there ._. When asked how some of the girls regained their freedom ,_,  Shettima said information reaching him had revealed that 10 of the girls were asked by the insurgents to prepare their meals ,_,  and they took the opportunity that presented itself when they were washing plates ,_,  to flee the camp ._. Shettima added that the time called for sober reflection and should not be used to apportion blame ,_,  insisting that everyone was required to contribute his quota to find the students and reunite them with their families ._. He said :_:  I want to appreciate the efforts of the military in the task of bringing peace back to the state ._. Shettima said he would not rest until all the abducted students are reunited with their families ._. He said it was unfortunate that the students were abducted ,_,  as the state had envisaged something like this might happen and had put in place strategies to check it ._. He said one of the strategies was the premature closure of schools about two weeks ago ,_,  stressing that his government had closed down schools in the state knowing that the insurgents might strike ._. Subsequently ,_,  Shettima added that the state government was compelled to bring the students to a central and secure place to write their WAEC/SSCE examination ._. He said at various times whenever information was received ,_,  schools under threat of attacks had been closed ._. He said :_:  We have had cause to close down prematurely the schools in the state ._. 
Students of GSS Konduga were rescued on the day Konduga was attacked ._. 
We congregated all the students in a central place ._. 
Students were moved from Mafa to Maiduguri to guard against attacks ._. He regretted the abduction of the students of the school in Chibok ,_,  stating that since the town is a largely Christian community ,_,  it was not anticipated that it would be attacked ,_,  adding that the state government had been given the assurance that the school was safe ._. Also ,_,  reacting to the kidnapping of the schoolgirls ,_,  former British prime minister said it was time for the world to wake up to the threat to girls and boys who simply want to go to school in Nigeria ._. Drawing the attention of the world to the plight of school children in the North -_: east ,_,  Brown said :_:  Over 100 girls were abducted in an attack on a school in North -_: east Nigeria earlier today ._. 
A few weeks ago ,_,  over 40 children were murdered in an attack on their school ._. The abduction from the school in Chibok ,_,  Borno State ,_,  follows the bombings yesterday ,_,  which killed more than 70 people in the capital ,_,  Abuja ._. 
The attacks are blamed on the same group ,_,  Boko Haram ,_,  whose name means ,_,  'Western education is forbidden' ._. The threat to children who simply want an education has led to hundreds of deaths in the last three years ._. 
Massacres of innocent boys and girls are not uncommon ._. 
This year alone ,_,  the group's fighters have killed more than 1 ,_, 500 civilians ,_,  hundreds of them children ,_,  in three states in North -_: east Nigeria ._. 
Boko Haram condemns what they say is a 'Western -_: style education' ,_,  and its militants frequently target schools and educational institutions ._. Approximately one dozen girls escaped last night's Monday attack ._. 
Running into the bush and wandering until daybreak ,_,  they returned to Chibok to find over 170 houses burnt down from the attack ._. Brown pledged the commitment of the UN to continue to support the Nigerian government to ensure that violence against children is stopped and all Nigerian boys and girls have the right to go to school safely ._. Similarly ,_,  China yesterday condemned the girls' abduction and voiced its firm support for the Nigerian government ._. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman ,_,  Hua Chunying ,_,  was quoted by the country's news agency Xinhua ,_,  in conjunction with the News Agency of Nigeria NAN as saying :_:  In reference to the raid on the girls' college in Chibok Town in northeastern Nigeria ,_,  China strongly condemns and opposes terrorism in all forms ._. We urge the immediate release of those innocent students and assurance of their safety ._. She said China ,_,  as Nigeria's strategic cooperative partner ,_,  would continue to firmly support the Nigerian government to safeguard its national security and stability ._. On the same note ,_,  UNICEF yesterday condemned in strong terms the abduction of the schoolgirls from their school hostel and called for their immediate and unconditional release ._. In a statement issued by UNICEF and signed by Regional Director for West and Central Africa ,_,  Manuel Fontaine ,_,  the UN body said it is deeply concerned about the persistent trend of attacks on schools in Nigeria ._. 
Most recently ,_,  unidentified gunmen killed 53 children between 13 and 17 years old at the Federal Government College ,_,  Buni Yadi ,_,  Yobe State ,_,  in February ._. According to Fontaine ,_,  Such brutal acts of violence are unacceptable ._. 
Attacks on schools deny children their right to learn in a safe environment and can rob them of their future ._. 
Wherever it takes place ,_,  abduction of children is a crime and illegal under international law ._. While expressing its solidarity with the communities affected by the horrific acts ,_,  UNICEF assured the affected communities that it stands with the families of the abducted children in these difficult times as well as called for greater efforts to protect all children throughout Nigeria ._. Fontaine added :_:  The Nigerian government should urgently take steps to make sure that the children are returned to their families unharmed and that they can continue their education in a safe environment ._. 
The Nigerian Ambassador accredited near Monrovia calmed her nerves ,_,  controlled her emotions and played it cool until an elapse of a week before responding to allegations of wrongdoing which necessitated calls for her withdrawal from Liberia ._. Recently ,_,  Ambassador Chigozie F ._. 
Obi -_: Nnodozie witnessed a violent rapture of demonstration in front of Nigeria House ,_,  the official residence of office of the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Congo Town ,_,  orchestrated by group of Nigerians living in Liberia ,_,  claiming that she lost the credentials to represent them and that she has gone beyond the bond of assignment ._. of putting them in the firing line by referring to them as members of Boko Haram ,_,  a semi terrorist organization that continues to set the Nigeria ablaze with all kinds of violent and ruthless attacks ._. Beyond those ,_,  the protesting Nigerians also claimed Obi -_: Nnodozie failed to represent their interest as she was in constant habit of masterminding their arrests and incarceration by state security officers ,_,  particularly the police ._. But the embattled Ambassador had the time yesterday when the Nigerian Community in Liberia pledged unwavering commitment to her and the work she is doing in Liberia to trash and rubbish the allegations leveled against her ._. Retorting to the issue of Boko Haram being in Liberia or referring to Nigerians here as members of the terrorist organization ,_,  she sounded abrasive a bit ,_,  and vouched the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will use every resource to ensure that Boko Haram is brought down ._. Apparently taking aback by the claims that she branded Nigerian citizens living in Liberia as Boko Haram ,_,  the Envoy said sounded diplomatic ,_,  noting maybe the group knows that there is Boko Haram in the country ._. I have not seen nor have I had any form of exchange with both Abeku and Yaya Bengo who might have spearheaded the demonstration; may be they are telling us that there is Boko Haram in Liberia ,_,  the Nigerian diplomat added ._. According to diplomats ,_,  her statement is a presupposition that the allegation is far from reality and that it is the orchestration of the demonstrators ,_,  whom she referred to as group of hooligans ._. Addressing members of the Nigerian Community yesterday Tuesday April 15 ,_,  2014 ,_,  Ambassador Obi -_: Nnodozie said the recent demonstration by hooligans claiming to be Nigerians was unacceptable ._. Such demonstration ,_,  she continued ,_,  has the propensity to undermine the hard earned credibility of the people of Nigerian including that of the Government of the federal Republic of Nigeria ._. Providing little light on what might have ignited the remonstration against her ,_,  she said the crux of the matter is when the both gentlemen during a Nigeria community meeting with the Ambassador early March 2014 introduced themselves as naturalized Liberians ,_,  they were asked out of the meeting ._. Her action ,_,  she clarified was in line with diplomatic protocols which require that a naturalized citizen of another nation should not have anything do with the denounced nation ._. Diplomatic protocol dictates that a naturalized citizen of a host country cannot participate in the politics of a country that one has denounced and as such they could not participate in the affairs the citizens of Nigeria ,_,  Madam Obi -_: Nnadozie said ._. At the same time ,_,  Nigerians in the Diaspora Organization/Liberia NIDOL ,_,  have pledged support to the Ambassador and called on Nigerians here on Liberians to stay out of the politics of Nigeria ._. The group's Vice President General Shola Bello said it was ridiculous that members of the so -_: called Nigerian Community and Descendants Union of Liberia NCDUL would bring young boys from the streets to carry placards in front of Nigeria House ,_,  calling for the resignation of the Ambassador and her withdrawal ._. NCDUL is where some individuals who have renounced their Nigerian citizenship and claimed to be naturalized Liberians hide themselves to spoil the image of the both countries ,_,  he noted ._. According to him ,_,  anyone who threatens the peace of the Nigerian Embassy will be subjected to verification and investigation to the Ministries of Foreign affairs and Justice and other appropriate government agencies ._. 
Among those tribal communities and institutions that publically condemned the April 8 ,_,  2014 riot at the Embassy and have pledged solidarity to the Ambassador include Nigerian in Diaspora Organization/Liberia ,_,  New Nigerian Movement Against Justice and the Igbo Youth Congress of Liberia ._.

There is controversy over the rescue of abducted school girls in Borno with the state government and the school principal faulting the military's claim that most of the pupils have been freed ._. The claim by military officials in Abuja on Wednesday that 107 abducted girls of Government Girls Secondary School GGSS Chibok were freed is a huge lie ,_,  Borno government officials ,_,  the management of the school and residents have said ._. The Principal of Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Asabe Kwambura ,_,  told PREMIUM TIMES Thursday morning that the military's claim was false ._. There is nothing in the military statement that is true about our abducted girls ,_,  Mrs ._. 
Kwambura said ._. 
Up till now we are still waiting and praying for the safe return of the students; all I know is that we have only 14 of them ,_,  and the security people especially the Vigilante and the well meaning volunteers of Gwoza are still out searching for them ._. She continued ,_,  The military people too are in the bush searching ._. 
So we have not received any information that they have gotten the students yet ._. 
So let it be clear that all the information passed on the media by the military concerning 107 girls is not true ._. 
I ,_,  as the principal did not tell any body any figure on released students other than what our Governor ,_,  His Excellency Kashim Shettima had informed the media ._. The Principal said she was contacted by the military headquarters in Abuja yesterday and some person was asking her to confirm the number of girls released ._. I told them that I don't want to be seen to be contradicting myself on that because what the governor said was what we know about; and I told them there may be additional rescue of the girls ,_,  but up to this moment we have not received any of them apart from what we had before ,_,  the principal said ._. 
What the governor said is still the true picture of the whole issue and that information given by the military is totally wrong ._. 
The military spokesperson at the Defence Headquarters ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade ,_,  had Wednesday issued a statement claiming that 107 abducted girls were freed; adding that only eight of the girls were still missing and the military was searching for them ._. 
He also claimed that a member of the Boko Haram sect that participated in the abduction was also nabbed by the military ._. 
Borno state Governor ,_,  ashim Shettima was also quoted by the BBC Hausa service this morning faulting the claims of the military ._. He reportedly said ,_,  We have recovered 14 of the girls and we have announced a N50 million reward for any credible information that will help us get our girls released and rejoined with their families ._. 
PREMIUM TIMES also enquired from a top official of the Department of State Service DSS in Maiduguri who ordinarily should know about the rescue of the girls ._. We have no such information apart from the 14 that escaped; if there is anything like that ,_,  no one would want to hide it from the media; may be the military have their own intel on that ,_,  which we probably are not aware of for now ,_,  he said ._. Some relatives and parents of the abducted girls said they were not happy with the way the military is misleading the world about the innocent girls ._. 
A female senior Civil Servant with the Borno state government ,_,  who requested not to be named said ,_,  What kind of nonsense is this for God sake Why are they playing politics with the lives of these innocent girls; I had just called some of my relatives in Chibok and they told me none of the girls had been released apart from the 14 that escaped back to town ._. 
We hope the military is not doing some thing funny with this very sensitive issue ._. When contacted late last night ,_,  Mr ._. 
Olukolade insisted it was the principal of the school who told the military that only eight girls were now missing ._. 
Abuja � THE opposition All Progressives Congress criticised President Goodluck Jonathan for embarking on campaign exercise at a time the country was mourning the death of victims of the bomb blast outside Abuja ._. APC said he was exhibiting the traits of an insensitive and utterly hardhearted leader ._. The message that President Jonathan is sending to Nigerians is that keeping his plum job ,_,  at all cost ,_,  is more important to him than the security and welfare of the same people who voted him into office ._. Otherwise ,_,  the President would not have rushed back to his illegal campaign trail at a time he should be leading the nation in mourning the dead ,_,  APC stated on Wednesday ._. A President who said his ambition is not worth the blood of anyone is now dancing gleefully on the graves of over 70 of his compatriots ._. What is so important about the illegal campaign stop in Kano on Tuesday that could not have waited for the smoke to clear from the scene of the deadly blast on Monday Who will President Jonathan rule over when his countrymen and women are being daily mowed down under his watchAPC said President Jonathan erred badly by not showing enough sympathy for the victims of Monday's blast ._. More people died in the blast than from Kenya's mall shooting last September ,_,  yet President Uhuru Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning during which flags at public buildings flew at half mast and the people of Kenya prayed for the dead and the injured ._. The blast on Monday ,_,  which killed more than 70 people ,_,  was the latest in a series of attacks that have claimed thousands ._. 
The attacks have been blamed on the Islamist Boko Haram sect ._. How can a President whose failure of leadership has led to the untimely deaths of 1 ,_, 500 mostly civilians in the hands of terrorists this year alone be so numb to the fate and plight of those who voted him into office Or how else does one describe the action of a President who was in a celebratory mood in Kano on Tuesday ,_,  even when the surviving victims are still writhing in pain in various hospitals ,_,  the bodies of the victims are still lying cold in the morgue and the fate of dozens of abducted school girls remains unknown ,_,  APC queried ._. It was reported on Tuesday that 200 school girls have been abducted by Boko Haram in Borno ._. 
Borno State government and management of Government Girls Secondary School GGSS Chibok where over 100 school girls were abducted by Boko Haram gunmen on Tuesday ,_,  have said the military's claim on freeing 107 of the missing girls is false ._. The spokesman of the Defence Headquarters ,_,  Brigadier General Chris Olukolade had Wednesday issued a statement claiming that 107 of the kidnapped SSS -_: 3 girls had been freed ._. His statement reads :_:  More students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok have been freed this evening in the ongoing search and rescue operations to free the abducted students ._. 
With this development ,_,  the principal of the school confirmed that only eight of the students are still missing ._. 
One of the terrorists who carried out the attack on the school has also been captured ._. 
Efforts are underway to locate the remaining 8 students ._. But the principal of GGSS Chibok ,_,  Mrs ._. 
Asabe Kwambura ,_,  whom Brigadier Olukolade said had given him the information on Wednesday ,_,  has denied ever feeding him with such figure ,_,  even as she insisted that only 14 of the abducted girls had been freed as announced earlier by Governor Kashim Shettima ._. Mrs ._. 
Kwambura ,_,  who spoke to journalists in Maiduguri ,_,  said There is nothing in the statement issued by the military that is true about our abducted girls ._. 
Up till now ,_,  we are still waiting and praying for the safe return of the students; all I know is that we have only 14 of them ,_,  and the security people ,_,  especially the vigilante and the well -_: meaning volunteers of Gwoza ,_,  are still out there searching for them ._. 
The military people too are in the bush searching ._. 
So we have not received any information that they have the students yet ._. 
So let it be clear that all the information passed on through the media by the military concerning 107 girls is not true ._. 
I ,_,  as the principal ,_,  did not give anybody any figure on released students other than what His Excellency ,_,  Governor Kashim Shettima had informed the media ,_,  said Mrs Kwambura ._. They contacted me from the army headquarters in Abuja and I told them that I don't want to be seen to be contradicting myself on that because what the governor had said was what we knew ._. I also told them there could be further rescue of the girls ,_,  but up to this moment ,_,  we have not received any of them apart from what we had before ._. 
What the governor said is still the true picture of the whole issue and the information given by the military is totally wrong ._. The Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima was also heard speaking in an interview aired on the Hausa Service of the BBC on Thursday morning that only 14 girls had been recovered so far ._. We have recovered 14 of the girls and we have announced a N50 million reward for any credible information that will help us get our girls released and rejoined with their families ,_,  the governor said ._. Many residents of Maiduguri who are angered by the sad development feel this denial has laid bare the truth on how the military may have been feeding the public with false claims on victories of their troops over the Boko Haram insurgents ._.

Families are searching for missing members ,_,  the injured are battling for life ,_,  condolences are only commencing ,_,  tears are running freely ,_,  the wailings are loud ,_,  fear ,_,  panic and uncertainty abound ,_,  but the man who swore by the Holy Bible to protect our lives ,_,  was in ebullient moods ,_,  professing his plans to be president again ._. The insensitivity was simply unspeakable ._. 
Nigerians were mulling the situation ._. 
Some had suggested a day of national mourning ._.

Is his stay in office more important than the lives of NigeriansWhile he was thumping the opposition in Kano ,_,  beaming his best smiles ,_,  news spread that Boko Haram had abducted over 100 female students of a government school ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State ._. The President's quick appearance at the scene of the Nyanya bombing ,_,  hospital visit to the injured ,_,  earned him some marks unlike in August 2011 when he arrived the bombed United Nations building days after the incident that killed 26 ,_,  including foreigners ._. We never knew a rally in Kano ,_,  the next day ,_,  was so important it could not be cancelled ,_,  at least postponed ._. 
We thought as he pursues his ambition ,_,  the President would burnish his image by caring ._. He prefers to maintain a record of absence at critical moments ._. 
On 12 June 2012 ,_,  Nigerians woke up to realise their President had departed for the Earth Summit in Rio ,_,  Brazil ,_,  two days after Sunday's bombing of three churches in Zaria and Kaduna ,_,  a continuation of the almost weekly Boko Haram attacks on churches in Northern Nigeria ._. Kaduna was immediately placed under a 24 -_: hour curfew ._. 
The next day ,_,  gunmen attacked Damaturu ,_,  Yobe State ,_,  leading to scores of casualties ._. 
By Tuesday ,_,  President Jonathan ,_,  his wife ,_,  some governors ,_,  and government officials were in Rio ._. One of the problems we have is that some Nigerians play politics with everything ,_,  but we cannot destroy our country because of personal political ambitions ,_,  the President had retorted to critics of his Rio adventure ._.

Kano � The Christian Elders' Forum of Northern States NOSCEF has asked the federal government to be more proactive in curtailing the Boko Haram insurgency ,_,  saying Nigeria cannot be broken by insurgents ._. The chairman and national secretary of the forum ,_,  Olaiya Phillips and Emmanuel Subilim ,_,  said in statement that attacks by the insurgents lack comprehensible logic ._. If the thousands of innocent civilians killed already this year are not evidence enough of Boko Haram's immoral disregard for the sanctity of human life ,_,  last weekend and Monday's atrocities can leave no room for doubt ._. 
They have attacked Christians and Muslims indiscriminately in their quest to impose a radical interpretation of their religion ._. 
They have killed teachers and students in their pursuit to prevent northern Nigerians from educating themselves ._. 
They have attacked men and women ,_,  old and young ._. 
We are incensed by the callous actions of Boko Haram and their criminal affiliates for every single attack that they have committed ,_,  for every single life they have taken and for every family they have tried to break ._. 
Nigeria will not be broken ,_,  they said ._. While consoling families of the victims of Monday's blast in Abuja ,_,  the forum commended security forces in their effort to rid the country of insurgents ._. 
The Federal Government came under pressure yesterday to try to find more than 100 schoolgirls who were abducted by suspected Boko Haram gunmen from a secondary school in Borno State on Monday night ._. Speaking separately ,_,  the United States Ambassador to Nigeria Mr James Entwistle ,_,  the Nigerian Labour Congress NLC and parents of the missing students urged the government to do everything possible to rescue the girls ._. About 129 female students were taken from the Government Girls Secondary School Chibok ,_,  130 kilometres south -_: west of Maiduguri ._. 
Some of them were reported to have escaped following the breakdown of the vehicle by which they were being conveyed ._. Mr ._. 
Entwistle ,_,  who spoke in Lagos after the opening of the 2014 edition of a multi -_: national military exercise ,_,  expressed shock at the abduction ._. That kind of incident ,_,  along with the bombing in Abuja ,_,  underlines why my country stands with your country in the fight against terrorism ._. 
We will be helping in appropriate way but our heart goes to all of those children ,_,  he said ._. For its part ,_,  the NLC ,_,  in a statement by its Acting General Secretary Chris Uyo ,_,  urged action in rescuing these young and innocent girls before any more harm befalls them ._. The congress urged for a fundamental change of strategy in confronting the Boko Haram insurgency ._. Meanwhile ,_,  parents of the abducted girls yesterday staged a protest in Chibok town's market area over the handling of security issues by the Federal Government ._. The female parents blamed the abduction of the schoolgirls on the failure of government to tackle the security situation in the area ._. One of the protesting women ,_,  who spoke to the BBC Hausa radio ,_,  said :_:  We have run out of patience ,_,  and instead of remaining at our homes ,_,  we better come out ._. 
We are many by the town market ._. 
You could see women here rolling on the ground in grievance ._. I was in a village when I got the information that my daughter has been kidnapped ._. 
I rushed back and I could not see my daughter ,_,  who is 19 ._. 
How would I live now without my daughter I am devastated ._. She added :_:  What I am praying for now is to see my daughter again ._. 
Even if she is dead ,_,  I want to see her corpse ._. A resident of Chibok told the BBC Hausa radio that people in the town have been agonising over the incident ,_,  as almost each home has either a daughter or a relative among the abducted teenage girls ._. If you will come to Chibok now ,_,  you would see families going to their neighbors to console for their missing daughters ,_,  he said ._. In Maiduguri ,_,  Governor Kashim Shettima yesterday announced an offer of N50 million to anyone who provides useful information which leads to the rescue of the abducted students ._. He said at a news briefing that 10 students escaped from Boko Haram captivity yesterday ,_,  bringing the total number of those who escaped so far to 14 ._. I want to make a pledge of N50 million for any information -_:  -_: relevant ,_,  credible information that will lead to the rescue of these innocent girls ,_,  he said ._. I have been in contact with the principal of the school and District Head of Chibok and they informed me that 10 of the girls escaped from the Boko Haram camp ,_,  bringing the total number of those seen now to 14 ,_,  he added ._. Shettima said the 10 escapees were asked to be involved in the preparation of meals by the insurgents and they took the opportunity of washing plates to flee the camp ._. The governor explained that a total of 129 final -_: year science students undertaking exams were at the school hostel when the attackers came ._. 
He said other science students were day students while the rest of the students were on holiday ._. But he added that the exact number of abducted students was yet to be ascertained ._. Shettima said a register had been opened for parents and guardians to make formal reports on missing wards ,_,  and that so far 50 complaints had been filed ._. The governor said his government was willing to do everything possible to ensure the students reunite with their families ._. He vowed to relocate to Chibok today to personally monitor the ongoing joint rescue operation by security operatives around the Sambisa Forest ._. I wanted to go to Chibok but I was advised against it because of military operations going on around there ,_,  he said ._. Shettima said the abduction was very traumatic ,_,  disturbing and serious moment of trial for us as a people ,_,  and added :_:  I want to appreciate the efforts of the military in the task of bringing peace back to the state ._. DHQ :_:  Only 8 remain missingThe Defence Headquarters in Abuja last night said only eight girls remained missing as all the rest had been rescued by evening ._. In a statement ,_,  Director of Defence Information Major -_: General Chris Olukolade said :_:  More students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok have been freed this evening in the ongoing search & rescue operations to free the abducted students ._. With this development ,_,  the Principal of the school has confirmed that only 8 of the students are still missing ._. 
One of the terrorists who carried out the attack on the school has also been captured ._. In an earlier statement ,_,  Olukolade had said more students have this afternoon been freed as troops pursuing the terrorists close in on the den of those believed to have carried out the attack ._. 
A total of 129 students had earlier been abducted by a group of terrorists ._. Earlier in the day ,_,  there were rumours on social media that dozens of the abducted girls have been found under a tree in the bushes around Sambisa ._. 
But credible security sources said only two were seen straying and were rescued by soldiers ._. The source said ,_,  The operation hasn't been easy but there is pressure from all directions on the need to rescue the girls before it is too late and we are making headway ._. Daily Trust also learnt that hundreds of youth vigilantes locally known as Civilian JTF from Maiduguri ,_,  Bama and Damboa have joined the search efforts ._. One of their leaders ,_,  who does not want to be named ,_,  said ,_,  Over 700 of our members are now in the bush ,_,  giving a helping hand to security agencies because we know the terrain better ._. 
We feel it is unacceptable to allow this impunity to continue because if nothing is done ,_,  the terrorists would one day come and take our mothers ._. The senator representing Borno South ,_,  Senator Mohammed Ndume ,_,  also confirmed the involvement of the 'Civilian JTF' in the rescue efforts ._. He told the BBC Hausa radio :_:  Security and those youths ,_,  popularly known as the Civilian JTF ,_,  are following up the route ._.   ._. 
I spoke to the security and they told me they are in the bush ._. 
You know this bush that is between Chibok and Damboa is a very big one ,_,  because it links up to Yobe and borders a neighboring country ._. Ndume ,_,  while responding to a question on whether there were security personnel in Chibok before the school attack ,_,  said even opposite the school in Chibok ,_,  there were about 50 soldiers deployed ._. 
Only that these people came around 12 midnight ._. 
THE rumour has been making the rounds that the All Progressives Congress ,_,  APC ,_,  is plotting to unfold a presidential ticket made up of a Muslim for President and another Muslim for Vice President in the impending 2015 elections ._. 
The rumour has it that retired Major General Muhammadu Buhari will be the presidential candidate while his co -_: leader of the Party ,_,  Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu ,_,  will be his running mate ._. Some unnamed top officers of the party have been quoted as dismissing the rumour ,_,  as it is already kicking up storms that might threaten the fragile fabric of the newly amalgamated patchwork of three parties ._. 
The Presidency is being blamed for this rumour ,_,  because the ruling Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  and its supporters have often demonised the APC as the Janjaweed and Muslim Brotherhood due to the overwhelming dominance of its commanding heights by Muslims from Arewa North and Yorubaland ._. 
The APC has always rebuffed this labelling ,_,  accusing the PDP of playing the religious card against it because it has long sensed its imminent downfall at the party's feet ._. Political sabre -_: rattling apart ,_,  I do hope ,_,  for its own sake that the APC will not dream of such double left -_: handed pairing for presentation to the Nigerian electorate ._. 
It will result in one of the most comprehensive defeats in the annals of Nigeria's presidential votes ._. 
It is not just a Muslim -_: Muslim ticket that will meet this sort of electoral waterloo ._. 
Any attempt to concoct a Christian -_: Christian ticket will fare no better ._. 
I do not think that any Christian presidential candidate will even contemplate it because Christians in Nigeria are far more sensitive to fair balancing of political scales than Muslims ._. Many Nigerian Muslims often assume ,_,  without any credible or proven shred of evidence ,_,  that their population is more than those of Christians ._. 
They are always eager to take daring unilateral steps in favour of their religion ,_,  such as the enlistment of Nigeria in the Organisation of Islamic Conference ,_,  OIC ,_,  in 1996 without the matter being debated at the Supreme Military Council ._. 
Other instances include the design of the Presidential Villa with Muslim architecture ,_,  the design of Nigeria's flag in Sokoto Caliphate Usmaniyya Muslim colours ,_,  the naming of Barbeach road in Victoria Island ,_,  Lagos after Ahmadu Bello signifying that he dipped the Koran into the Atlantic as he had boasted he would do ,_,  the inscription of Islamic messages in ajami in our currency notes ,_,  as well as the recitation of Koranic verses by Muslims before speaking at official public functions ,_,  without regard to the multi -_: religious complexion of such gatherings ._. In April 1993 after the Social Democratic Party ,_,  SDP ,_,  convention in Jos ,_,  the winner of the Party's presidential ticket ,_,  Alhaji Moshood Abiola ,_,  picked his closest rival ,_,  Alhaji Babagana Kingibe ,_,  as his running mate ,_,  thus creating the first Muslim -_: Muslim ticket for a presidential contest by a major national political party in Nigeria ._. 
The ticket defeated its Muslim/Christian rival of the National Republican Convention ,_,  NRC ,_,  led by Alhaji Bashir Tofa with Dr Silverster Ugoh as running mate ._. 
Emboldened by the apparent magnanimity of the Nigerian Christian community in overlooking the anomaly because of the special circumstances of that time ,_,  the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria ,_,  ACN ,_,  created another Muslim -_: Muslim presidential ticket with Malam Nuhu Ribadu as presidential candidate and Alhaji Fola Adeola as his running mate in the 2011 presidential poll contest ._. 
The ACN only got 2 ._. 1 million votes ,_,  while the more balanced tickets of President Goodluck Jonathan/Vice President Namadi Sambo won with 22 ._. 5 million ,_,  followed by Muhammadu Buhari/Pastor Tunde Bakare 12 ._. 2 million ._. It is important for politicians to note that the Abiola/Kingibe winning ticket was a mere fluke ._. 
Prevailing factors made Nigerians to put aside ethnic ,_,  religious ,_,  regional and other divisive factors aside to vote for that ticket ._. 
Top among these was the fact that both Abiola and Kingibe were popular all over the country and had grassroots appeal each on his own steam ._. 
Their cult images transcended primordial borders ._. 
Secondly ,_,  their opponent ,_,  Tofa was a dark horse ,_,  and his running mate ,_,  Ugoh ,_,  lacked popular support even among his Igbo people ._. Buhari is only popular among the rabble of the Muslim Arewa North ,_,  with little horizontal appeal among the elite even in the North ._. 
Tinubu is the prevailing political leader of the Yoruba people ,_,  but many are beginning to doubt his hold in the zone after the way he imposed family members and cronies in high places in the defunct ACN ._. 
Murmurings are getting louder over the marginalisation of Christians in his political fold ._. 
The APC has to do something extraordinary to disprove the Muslim -_: domination tag developing around it or it will become a drag on its electoral fortunes ._. The truth be told ,_,  Nigeria is a multi -_: religious society ._. 
It is a country created to give ethnicity ,_,  region and religion their special places of pride ._. 
The original founding fathers of Nigeria's independence ,_,  such as Dr Herbert Macaulay and Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe set out to make Nigeria more than a mere geographical expression by fomenting a nation united by common citizenship like the US and other progressive multi -_: racial societies ._. 
But Chief Obafemi Awolowo and his Action Group brought tribalism into the country's politic ,_,  while Sardauna Ahmadu Bello brought Islamic imperialism and Arewa fundamentalism ._. 
Between these two ,_,  Macaulay and Zik's nationalism was defeated and Nigeria has lived for ever unhappily after ._. Political parties that seek to win elections in Nigeria must carefully and strategically balance their tickets between Christianity and Islam and between North and South ,_,  East and West ._. 
It is not only equity; it is the right thing to do ._. 
There will be no shortage of talents from any corner of Nigeria to carry out the balancing act ._. 
To say it does not matter is self -_: deceit ._. 
If a section of Nigeria will not accept a Christian/Christian ticket ,_,  what makes it think the others will accept a Muslim/Muslim one The sectarian violence masquerading in Sharia riots ,_,  Boko Haram attacks ,_,  Fulani militia strikes on Christian -_: dominated hamlets at night and places of worship in Northern Nigeria cannot promote a political society where religion does not matter ._. Those who ignore the Nigerian reality and present single -_: cell presidential tickets must be ready to accept the defeat that awaits them ._.

Chairman of the forum Rochas Okorocha said :_:  We pray that we should unite at this moment to fight this evil ._. 
We have decided to establish a Trust Fund for APC governors to support the families of victims of this unholy act and we shall also join forces with other democrats to ensure that this bad story ends as quickly as possible ._. He expressed condolences to bereaved families saying We know they must be in serious pains at this moment ._. 
What happened was rather unfortunate and it is one killing too many ._. The governors condemned the daily loss of lives across the country which has refused to abate in spite of government's efforts ._. We notice that the increase blood shedding in our nation is becoming worrisome and as leaders we believe that this is not a time to say what is wrong or who is wrong but this is a time that we must all close hands to ensure the safety of lives and properties ,_,  they said ._. They also condemned the abduction of about 129 teenage girls at a school in Borno state by suspected Boko Haram insurgents saying that the nation cannot live in such situations but urged Nigerians to remain calm ._. 
Last week ,_,  this column focused on the presentation at the on going National Conference by Malam Nurudeen Lemu ,_,  a delegate representing the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs ,_,  from Niger state ._. The young man in his thirties provided an interfaith perspective to the Conference and got a thunderous ovation ._. 
His message was refreshingly different and stood out from the pool of divisive statements being made by the demagogues among the delegates ._. 
Malam Nurudeen drew from the Charter of Madina ,_,  the first Islamic State during the time of the Prophet Muhammad SAW which was a multi religious state that respected and protected the rights its non Muslim citizens ._. 
He said 'as Muslim delegates ,_,  we come in brotherhood ,_,  as brothers and friends to solve our common problems and not as adversaries ._. ' Malam Nurudeen also highlighted a common trend among those who will exploit everything including religion to satisfy their own agenda ._. 
When he said 'We come against the exploitation of religion and religious sentiments ._. 
We come against stereotyping ,_,  stigmatizing and dehumanizing of each other ._. 
We come against the use of religion as a political decoy and as a distraction from the critical things that bedevil our nation ._. 
He ended his speech with a much needed prayer for humanity ._. 
'I pray that at the end of this conference ,_,  we will all grow in our humanity and respect for each other ._. 'The interfaith perspective has the support of the pro democracy civil society organisations working on a common platform to address 'the Critical things that bedevil our nation ._. ' They shared their own perspectives making it clear that the National Conference which was extracted out of an unwilling government must be used to address critical national issues ._. 
The CSOs said 'the decision to convene the National Conference was not an act of gratuitous charity on the part of a benevolent regime; but that it is rather a concession wrested from the hesitant hands of a regime facing increasing isolation and reduced popular acceptance ._. ' The timing of the conference was viewed by many saw as unsuitable and convened to satisfy a divisive agenda ,_,  coming on the heel of a hotly divisive centenary anniversary and on the eve of a general election that many citizens approach with apprehension ._. The CSOs however saw it as an opportunity for transformation by promoting their aspiration for national liberation ,_,  social emancipation ,_,  and fully participatory democratisation process ._. Specifically ,_,  the CSOs want a comprehensive Bill of Rights that incorporates all known civil ,_,  political ,_,  socio -_: cultural and economic rights and which shall be consolidated into a single justiciable and enforceable chapter of the Nigeria Constitution ._. 
Other CSO demands are a social welfare package ._. 
Among them are :_:  -_: The adoption of a socio -_: economic framework aimed at guaranteeing the basic minimum to every citizen ,_,  and prioritising an inclusive economic revival plan that will eradicate poverty ,_,  hunger ,_,  homelessness and joblessness in the society ._.  -_: A regime of fiscal federalism that encourages healthy competition amongst constituent units of the federation ,_,  while also ensuring that no section of the federation shall be left uncatered for ._.  -_: A genuinely mass participatory democratic polity that ensures the full involvement of citizens in decision making and implementation at all levels of government ._.  -_: A single citizenship of the Nigerian Federation for all citizens ,_,  with the only qualifying criteria for representation being agreed minimum residency status ._.  -_: Consensus on enforceable guiding principles for a comprehensive reform of the justice ,_,  security and law enforcement system ,_,  including a determination to expose and severely punish corruption ._.  -_: Open ,_,  unfettered discussions of all issues on the agenda of the National Conference in the full glare of Nigerian citizens ._.  -_: A National referendum as the only means for validating the resolutions of the National Conference ._. While we were absorbing our approach to the Conference ,_,  two serious security issues -_:  the bomb blast in Nyanya a suburb of Abuja and also in Borno occurred ._. 
It shocked all of us ._. 
We want the conference to make this a priority ._. 
Priscilla Achapa the Executive Director of Women Environment Project WEP spoke for civil society and we want the conference to address this ._. 
She highlighted the lack of value for human lives 'as the government fails to act in the best interests of the people  -_:  rather it serve the elites and foreign interests while people continue to suffer and die ._. Residents living in the suburb of Abuja woke up on April 14 2014 in search of their livelihood only to lose their lives in a bomb blast at the Bus Park Nyanya -_: Mararaba Road ._. 
At the last count seventy one people have lost their lives ._. The rising spate of killings ,_,  aside from the Boko Haram insurgence in the North East since 2010 to date ,_,  is disturbing ._. 
In the first quarter of this year alone we have witnessed greater killings of innocent children in their school in Yobe ,_,  massacre of men and youth ,_,  women and children in Benue ,_,  Plateau ,_,  Nasarawa ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  Zamfara states ._. 
The level of savagery that violent groups are visiting on innocent Nigerians is highly deplorable ._. The State has the obligation to protect lives and properties of her citizenry ,_,  however the reverse is the case ,_,  as these killings are being politicised ,_,  ignored ,_,  the perpetrators are rarely punished and no one is held accountable ._. 
The government must respond adequately to this national crisis ._. 
Lives must be secured ._. 
What is a nation without its people Given Nigeria's apparent inability to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of these crimes ,_,  we make this urgent call -_:  International community to promptly step in and conduct independent investigations to ensure that these heinous crimes against innocent Nigerians are stopped and perpetrators are brought to law ._.  -_: The African Union AU ,_,  even as Nigeria assumes its chairmanship for the Peace and Security ,_,  the Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS and the African Union's Peace and Security Council to assess immediately the conflict situation in Nigeria and provide full and effective support to end these acts of violence against civilians ._.  -_:  The Federal Government to review it strategies and take more proactive steps in curbing the activities of this insurgency while respecting human rights ._.  -_:  Lastly ,_,  we call on the President of the African First Ladies on Peace Mission ,_,  Dame Patience Jonathan ,_,  to as a matter of urgency address Nigerian women and children who have been victims of violent conflicts in Nigeria ,_,  who are in camps dying of cholera and other disease ,_,  without water ,_,  food ,_,  shelter and to -_:  -_:  Immediately initiate plans for reconstruction ,_,  rehabilitation and reintegration of the displaced population ._.  -_:  -_:  We demand that immediate plans are put in place to send relief materials to those in displaced camps especially in Benue ,_,  Nasarawa ,_,  Kaduna and Plateau States mostly women and children ._. 
We demand no less ._. 
Maiduguri � Gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram members again struck in Sabuwar Kasuwa of Hawul LGA of Borno State yesterday ,_,  killing a district head and his guard ._. Eighteen other villagers were killed when the insurgents stormed Wala village ,_,  130 kilometers south -_: west of Maiduguri in Gwoza LGA of the state around 7 :_: 00am yesterday ._. A local council official said in the past four months ,_,  dozens of villages had been sacked and hundreds of people killed in Gwoza which shares borders with the Republic of Cameroon ._. Honestly speaking ,_,  we are in a difficult time ._. 
Deaths and destructions have become a daily affair ._. 
18 people were killed in Wala this morning by the Boko Haram gunmen ,_,  he said as other residents added that before the Wala attack ,_,  the gunmen had attacked Sabon -_: Kasuwa village around 8pm ,_,  killing the district head and his aide ._. 
A security source confirmed the incidents ._. Yes ,_,  there was an attack in Wala and Sabuwar Kasuwa ._. 
A very sad development despite our efforts ,_,  he said ._. 
Mrs Asabe Kwambura ,_,  the Principal of GGSS Chibok in Borno State where over 100 female students were abducted by suspected Boko Haram terrorists today said she was shocked when she heard of claims by Nigerian military authorities that only eight girls are yet to be found ._. Kwambura said both teachers and parents of the missing students are still confused as to the whereabout of the abducted girls who were loaded in a truck and Hilux vehicles ._. There is nothing in the military statement that is true about our abducted girls ._. 
Up till now we are still waiting and praying for the safe return of the students; all I know is that we have only 14 of them ,_,  and the security people especially the Vigilante and the well meaning volunteers of Gwoza are still out searching for them ._. The military people too are in the bush searching ._. 
So we have not received any information that they have gotten the students yet ._. 
So let it be clear that all the information passed on the media by the military concerning 107 girls is not true ._. 
I ,_,  as the principal did not tell any body any figure on released students other than what our Governor ,_,  His Excellency Kashim Shettima had informed the media ,_,  she said ._. The principal wondered how such a large number of girls would be found and nobody sees them ._. The parents of these girls are in pain and somebody is saying they are in safe hands ,_,  where She asked ._. A military official called me from Abuja and I told him that I don't want to be seen to be contradicting myself on that missing girls because what the governor had said was what we know about ._. 
What the governor said is still the true picture of the whole issue and that information given by the military is totally wrong ._. Governor Shettima had at a press briefing yesterday said 14 girls have been rescued and a competent security source said two more girls 'straying' in the bush were recovered in the bush ,_,  making the number of those that were officially rescued to 16 ._. Locals in Maiduguri have decried what they called flagrant politicization of the lives of innocent girls ._. It is a shame that Nigerian authorities can go this far in misleading its people and the international community ._. only God knows the trauma these innocent girls are passing through in the bushes but someone is lying that they are safe ,_,  Monday Karda ,_,  a native of Chibok said ._. Hajiya Falmata Usman ,_,  a mother of five said those involved in misleading Nigerians most be forced to resign ._. The President should also relocate to Borno immediately and see to the release of these girls ._. 
The insurgents are in Sambisa and not Cameroon ._. 
Dont we have satelite images Dont we have fighter jets Dont we have enough troops to cordon the whole of Southern Borno and save this young girls She asked ._. Janet Abu ,_,  a student in Maiduguri said they deserve an apology from Nigerian authorities ._. I doubt much if I would pass my final year exams because my mind is with my abducted sisters ._. this is something that can also happen to me ._. If it is true that the girls have been freed ,_,  we want the military to show them on television; we want to hear their voices ,_, she said ._. 
The recent bomb attack in a bus terminal at Nyanya ,_,  a bustling outskirts of Abuja ,_,  by a suicide bomber suspected to be a Boko Haram terrorist or sympathizer ,_,  was one too many ._. Perhaps more than any of the previous attacks by the sect ,_,  the Nyanya incident ,_,  which targeted people hustling to get to work in the city of Abuja ,_,  aroused a collective sense of sorrow and outrage ._. 
Estimates of the dead and injured vary  -_:  depending on whom you want to believe ._. 
What appears obvious is that anywhere between 75 and 130 people lost their lives in that mayhem ,_,  with some 150 -_: 200 others sustaining various degrees of injury ._. 
Properties and means of livelihood lost in the carnage are yet to be estimated ._. 
The psychological trauma induced by the incident will live with many of the residents of Nyanya and beyond for a long time ._. Barely 24 hours after the Nyanya attack ,_,  came another report that some unidentified gunmen suspected to be members of the terrorist organization ,_,  abducted more than 100 female students from a Government Girls Secondary School at Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State  -_:  the epicentre of the Boko Haram challenge ._. 
Reports of deaths in Bornu state have become a daily staple such that for many ,_,  those deaths ,_,  reported daily in the media ,_,  no longer shock or awe them  -_:  a classical indication of the 'normalization' or routinization of evil ._. Our challenge as a nation is to refuse to allow such impunities to be 'normalized' by the frequency of their occurrences or the longevity of their existence ._. 
Retaining a sense of outrage against such impunities is the strongest statement that they are unacceptable and cannot be 'normalized' like other acts of impunity in the country ._. But why will otherwise 'normal' people derive sadistic joy in the mass murder of people who have done them no wrongThe German -_: American political theorist Hannah Arendt tells us that the great evils in history are not executed by fanatics or sociopaths but rather by ordinary people who accepted the premises of their actions and therefore participated in them on the grounds that those heinous actions were normal ._. 
She used this to explain why evil deeds tend to be everywhere in a society ._. 
She called this the 'banality of evil' ._. 
For her ,_,  those engaged in barbarous acts such as the Boko Haram terrorists accepted the premises of their actions as just  -_:  even if the rest of the society thinks otherwise ._. 
Acts of impunity against innocent Nigerians unfortunately reflects the federal  -_:  violent armed robberies across the entire country ,_,  kidnapping especially in the South -_: east and south -_: south ,_,  turf war by militarized cults and gangs in Bayelsa State ,_,  ritual murders everywhere ,_,  senseless intra and inter communal 'warfare' across several parts of the country and of course terrorism couched in religious revivalist rhetoric in parts of the North ._. Despite the 'banality of evil' or the 'normalization of the unthinkable' ,_,  in several parts of the country ,_,  there are reasons why the impunity purveyed by Boko Haram and groups acting in its name ,_,  or sympathetic to its cause ,_,  pose a special threat to the country :_: One ,_,  though impunity couched in religious revivalism has been an integral part of the conflicts in Nigeria ,_,  especially in Northern Nigeria ,_,  Boko Haram and Ansaru were the first drivers of conflicts in the country to be declared terrorist organizations by the United States and the United Kingdom ._. 
Two ,_,  both are also the first purveyors of violence in the country to be strongly linked to international terrorist networks ,_,  essentially Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb AQIM and possibly the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa ,_,  MOJWA ,_,  -_:  also known as Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa MUJWA ._. 
MUJA was formed in 2011 allegedly because of the marginalization of Black Africans in AQIM ._. Three ,_,  Boko Haram was also the first group to introduce suicide bombing in Nigeria ._. 
Use of suicide bombers had been unknown in West Africa because suicide is regarded as cultural anathema  -_:  until two high -_: profile attacks in Abuja  -_:  the June 2011 police headquarters bombing and the August 2011 United Nations headquarters bombing ._. 
Since then ,_,  suicide bombing has become part of the tools in the arsenal of the two groups ._. 
Four ,_,  the two terrorist groups were also probably the first purveyors of impunity in Nigeria with both international and domestic territorial ambitions ._. 
For instance while in 2011 ,_,  Boko Haram's terrorism was largely confined to Nigeria's northeast by the end of last year 2013 ,_,  Boko Haram -_:  driven attacks occurred in most of the 19 States in the North ,_,  including the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja ._. 
Boko Haram suspects have also been arrested in Lagos ._. 
The group was equally linked to the kidnapping of the French Catholic priest ,_,  Georges Vandenbeusch ,_,  in Cameroun in November 2013 and to another kidnapping of a French family in the same area of Cameroun in February 2013 ._. 
Flowing from the territorial ambitions of the two groups ,_,  the conflicts they trigger have wider national implications and by virtue of their links to international terrorist networks ,_,  also wider international implications than the traditional conflicts that the country is used to ._. Fighting the new terrorism has been problematic not only because of their methods but also because of disagreements on why such a group came about ._. 
The conspiracy theories that seek to explain the phenomenon tap into the fears that are edged in our traditional fault lines :_: There are several conspiracy theories about Boko Haram ._. 
One ,_,  which is popular among commentators from the Southern part of the country ,_,  is that the sect is sponsored by key Northern politicians to make the country 'ungovernable' for President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  a Christian from the minority Ijaw ethnic group ._. 
One of the weaknesses of this 'theory' is that much of the mayhem carried out by the sect has been in the North and against Northern Muslims ._. 
It is in fact difficult to see the nexus between destabilizing governance in some Northern states and making the country 'ungovernable' for the Jonathan administration ._. 
But there are several who believe in such ,_,  making it difficult to mobilize that sense of collective outrage needed to tackle the menace ._. 
Obviously there are certain local grievances that revivalist movements tap into but that must not be confused with deliberate sponsorship ._. Another conspiracy theory is that Boko Haram is actually being sponsored by the Jonathan administration to make Islam look bad or give the impression that the North was out to pull it down as a way of mobilizing the support of his 'Southern brethren' and Christians behind his administration ._. 
A variant of this is that Boko Haram is actually sponsored by the government to weaken or destroy the North ._. 
Those who believe in any of the variants of this conspiracy 'theory' ,_,  essentially people from the North ,_,  point out that during the Abacha days ,_,  the government deliberately bombed some places and then blamed it on NADECO ,_,  which was campaigning for the re -_: validation of the June 12 election won by Abiola but annulled by the military regime of Ibrahim Babangida ._. 
This variant of the conspiracy 'theory' therefore believes that the Jonathan administration is borrowing a leaf from the Abacha regime ._. One of the weaknesses of this theory however is that nothing in the confessions of some of the arrested Boko Haram members supports any of these conspiracy theories ._. 
Also it defies logic why a President should set part of his domain on fire ,_,  especially where one cannot determine the direction of such conflagration  -_:  just to weaken a particular religion or part of the countryWhile there are a number of other efforts at scholarly explanations of the reasons for the emergence and subsequent radicalization of the sect ,_,  I have always believed that a more comprehensive explanation will be to see the sect as a reflection of the crisis in our nation -_: building processes ._. 
The crisis in our nation -_: building conflates with the crisis of underdevelopment to create an existentialist crisis for many Nigerians ._. 
Therefore for many young people ,_,  a way of resolving the consequent sense of alienation is to retreat from the Nigeria project and construct meanings in chosen primordial identities  -_:  often with the Nigerian state as the enemy ._. 
This must not be confused with supporting or condoning Boko Haram and its ways but the need for us to dig deeper ,_,  including finding the local grievances that they tap into ._. 
We will need to fight both the symptom of the problem and the root cause simultaneously ._. Fighting terrorism is never easy or straight forward anywhere in the world ._. 
Victory can hardly come easily or quickly ._. 
Often the challenge is to contain the group such that the society can continue to function normally despite the episodic impunities they purvey  -_:  the way the society has learnt to live with other impunities carried out intermittently by other groups ._. 
The key challenge we have with Boko Haram is that the mayhem by the group is not only spreading across the country ,_,  but also becoming 'routinized' ._. 
And while this is happening ,_,  politicians are playing silly blame games while their foot soldiers complicate matters with their absurd conspiracy theories ._. 
Security agencies were told of an impending attack on Chibok by the Boko Haram sect even before Monday's abduction of many school girls but no action was taken ,_,  a resident told Daily Trust yesterday ._. The resident told our reporter on phone from Maiduguri that after several attacks on neighbouring communities ,_,  they heard on good authority that Boko Haram members had plans to move to Chibok ._. 
He said they informed the soldiers in Chibok about it ._. The resident ,_,  an uncle of one of the abducted girls ,_,  said instead of taking action ,_,  the security men in Damboa told their colleagues in Chibok to run away since they did not have the weapons to fight the Boko Haram members ._. So ,_,  the soldiers ran away on Monday around 8 ._. pm and left only mobile policemen and one soldier ._. 
The Boko Haram people killed one mopol ,_,  the soldier was killed when he was trying to jump a fence ,_,  he said ._. The resident added that the Boko Haram members divided themselves into two groups ,_,  one group going to the Government Secondary School and the other to Chibok town ._. He said so far ,_,  he had no information about any girl that returned yesterday apart from those that escaped while the insurgents were taking them away ._. He however added that security has been beefed up in the area as soldiers from Maiduguri and Domboa were drafted there ._. 
But despite that ,_,  he said ,_,  residents were not satisfied and had to leave ._. 
What is the political ,_,  psychological ,_,  military or insurgency significance of Monday's early morning bomb blast by suspected Boko Haram terrorists in which 75 persons have been officially confirmed to have died and nearly 300 injuredYou do not need to be a pundit to realize that the incident was planned and executed with the almost sole purpose of passing on a clear message to the authorities in Abuja ,_,  the complacent people of Nigeria and the entire world that Boko Haram is indeed still very much alive and dangerous ._. That Monday attack was meant by the Boko Haram strategists to say one very important statement namely ,_,  that the head of the organisation's core leadership has not yet been decapitated ._. 
If anything ,_,  it is still very much intact and thinking ._. 
The snake's tail may have been bruised ,_,  some part of it cut off ,_,  but it is still very much alive and dangerous ._. The master -_: minds of the Nyanya Abuja bombing are saying loud and clear that contrary to the growing confidence of some high ups in Abuja and the rest of the country that since several devastating blows have been dealt the group forcing them to the fringes of the country in the extreme north east of the country ,_,  it is no longer a potent threat to the safety and security of the country ._. 
But by the loud statement made on Monday ,_,  BH is saying that it still constitutes a major source of headache to the entire country ._. 
They are saying that they are not a north east problem but a Nigerian problem and you must shake yourself off from your smugness and take them more seriously ._. 
They are saying that they still have the capacity in men ,_,  money ,_,  expertise and materiel to strike at Nigeria anywhere ,_,  anyhow ,_,  any time it likes and that nothing can be done to stop them ._. 
And that the soul of Nigeria ,_,  Abuja ,_,  is very much within their grabs ._. Entirely expected ,_,  the outpouring of emotions from Nigerians across the country over the Monday incident has nevertheless amazed me ._. 
It is as if some Nigerians are only just now becoming aware of the outrageous atrocities of the Boko Haram insurgency because the group has dared to use Nyanya ,_,  a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory ,_,  to remind Nigerians of its unreasonable deadliness ._. 
This deadly group has been in existence for over three years now spreading death and mayhem ._. 
It started in Bauchi ,_,  spread to other parts of the North ,_,  visited the FCT and gave residents a taste of its gory campaign of terror before the security agencies drove them to the Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa axis where they have now made a stronghold ._. While dug in in that North East stronghold ,_,  making Borno their bastion and main operational headquarters ,_,  the group has engaged in one unimaginable act of mayhem after another ,_,  killing ,_,  maiming ,_,  abducting and levelling whole communities ._. 
The Governor of that State ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  has been crying himself hoarse appealing that some massive force be mobilised to finish the insurgent off there where they seemed cornered or else if they are allowed to disperse once again ,_,  we all will be in trouble ._. 
Now if that gentleman was one of these garrulous ,_,  irresponsible ,_,  insensitive and rascally fellows we seem to have in some high places ,_,  he would by now been singing a vindication song for all to hear :_:  'I told you people so but no one seemed to listen ._. 
See what has happened now ._. Somehow ,_,  the Nyanya incident by the Boko Haramists can be interpreted as a sadistic equal opportunity move to give the somehow aloof city people of Abuja a taste of the awful broth they have been serving governors Kashim Shettima and his colleague in neighbouring Yobe ,_,  Ibrahim Geidam ,_,  almost on daily basis in the past few months ._. 
It is true that it is in the nature of terror organisations like BH to sometimes make statements that exaggerate their significance but some of such statements can be ignored only at the peril of the nation ._. 
The Monday incident in Nyanya is one of such ._. 
I think it was meant to tell the decision makers in Abuja that the time has come for them to sit up and mobilise the entire country to wage a final onslaught on a group that seems determined to destroy the country ._. One of the things our leadership must do is to try to correct the impression that once Abuja is safe and secure all is well with Nigeria irrespective of what is happening at the fringes and that the moment security of the capital city is breached it is only then that something is seriously wrong ._. 
When you listen to the comments of some people you get the impression that they are only now realizing what has become a living reality ,_,  a nightmare ,_,  to the people of Borno and Yobe ._. 
With what happened in Nyanya ,_,  it means that no one is safe in Nigeria ,_,  some have said ._. 
Are you just knowing that now ,_,  I am tempted to respond from the comfort of my sitting room ._. 
Capital city people everywhere tend to feel that they are a special breed of people entitled to a better share of everything including security from their nation ._. 
They tend to feel that if some calamity exists in the fringes ,_,  it is somehow tolerable but the day it comes to the capital then something is seriously wrong ._. 
Something has been seriously wrong with Nigeria ever since BH declared war against the country ._. However ,_,  we must be alarmed by the Nyanya attack because of its special significance ._. 
It is an attack on Abuja ._. 
And since success tend to give birth to more success ,_,  no such spectacular success should again be allowed in Abuja or anywhere else in the country for that matter or else it will serve as a potent tonic for a resurgence of more daring attacks of that kind on the capital city ._. It is a shame that in the past few weeks some of our political leaders have been playing politics with the Boko Haram insurgency ,_,  trading blames and accusations like quarrelling housewives; inventing unbelievable conspiracy theories and telling improbable tales that sound more fanciful than old wives' tales ._. 
The Monday blast is a rude reminder to our politicians that such foolery must stop and deep thinking should come in its place ._. Since the thing that matters most to Nigerian politicians is endless politicking ,_,  I think the President should summon patriotic courage to announce a suspension of politicking in the whole country until the BH insurgency is dealt with and no further threat is felt in any part thereof before there can be any resumption of politics ._. 
Each politician ,_,  especially from the north east ,_,  should be required to go back to deliver his constituency from the grip of BH insurgents ._. 
Since every Nigerian politician's destiny will invariably be tied to the fulfilment of such a condition ,_,  it means in effect that such a challenge will push them to come together to figure out how they can collaborate to ensure a quick return to politics ,_,  the game they love best ._. 
In Nigeria violence has reached a new dimension with four attacks in three days ._. 
Instead of uniting against the terror ,_,  government and opposition politicians are trading accusations as the country drifts into chaos ._. Nigeria has been rocked by an unprecedented series of attacks ._. There have been no claims of responsibility for any of these attacks ._. 
However ,_,  Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan lost no time after the Monday bombing in accusing Islamist sect Boko Haram ,_,  which has been terrorizing northeastern Nigeria for the last five years ._. The issue of Boko Haram is quite an ugly history but we will get over it ._. 
The issue of Boko Haram is temporary ,_,  Jonathan said at the site of the bombing ._. The current series of attacks dramatically contradicts the president's words ._. 
They demonstrate how helpless the Nigerian state is in the face of the growing violence ._. This year alone ,_,  an estimated 1 ,_, 5000 people have been killed in attacks attributed to Boko Haram ._. 
All teaching was suspended in Borno several weeks ago In a reaction to the increasing frequency of attacks by the Islamist extremists against schools they regard as western -_: oriented ._. 
The kidnapped schoolgirls had only just returned to their boarding school to take their final examinations ._. Kidnappers were disguised as soldiersThe kidnappers claimed to be soldiers who had come to take the students to a place of safety as they had been alerted to an imminent attack ._. 
Only when they had boarded the waiting trucks and buses did the girls realize they were being kidnapped ._. 
Some escaped by jumping out of the moving trucks ._. 
The others were taken to an unknown destination ._. There are reports that Boko Haram extremists deliberately kidnapped schoolgirls in the past to force them to work for them and abuse them as 'sex slaves' ._. These events take terror in Nigeria to a new level ._. 
The pattern of attacks has changed ,_,  security expert and former major in the Nigerian army ,_,  Yahaya Shinku ,_,  said in an interview with DW ._. 
The frequency and range of the attacks has increased ._. 
They now target not only Boko Haram's stronghold in the northeast but also other parts of Nigeria ,_,  including the capital ._. The most dramatic change ,_,  observers say ,_,  is that the terror has become indiscriminate ._. 
There is no recognizable plan in the choice of targets ,_,  says Hildegard Berendt -_: Kigozi ,_,  head of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Abuja ._. 
For a long time Boko Haram attacks had mainly been directed against representatives of the state ,_,  such as members of the military or police ,_,  or against schools ._. 
The group's main demand is an independent state in North Nigeria governed according to their radical version of Islam ._. 
However ,_,  several villages in the north have also been attacked and Muslim residents murdered ._. A pre -_: election plotThere was also no recognizable motive for Monday's attack against commuters in Abuja other than the general destabilization of Nigeria ,_,  says Berendt -_: Kigozi ._. 
Any terrorist group seeking to impose its ideology would damage its credibility with such attacks ._. Nigeria's two main political parties ,_,  President Jonathan's People's Democratic Party PDP and the opposition All Nigeria People's Party ANPP ,_,  have long been trading mutual recriminations of making political capital from the Boko Haram terror or even supporting the group ._. 
The president even intimated there was a plot aimed at reducing his prospects of re -_: election ._. 
In January 2014 he fired the entire army leadership and the defense minister ,_,  blaming the latter for the escalating violence ._. Increasing polarizationOpposition members say the government shares responsibility for the terror which makes it difficult for people living in the mainly Muslim north to take part in the elections ._. 
Major Yahaya Shinku also suspects there is a connection between the latest wave of terror and the presidential elections scheduled for February 2015 ._. 
He says it will be difficult for the Electoral Commission to work in the affected areas ._. 
Many employees will not be prepared to risk their lives if the Commission is threatened ._. So far there are only theories but no conclusive evidence showing why Boko Haram has embarked on this new strategy or who else could be behind the indiscriminate violence ._. 
There is a lack of clarity about the causes and what would be an appropriate response to them ,_,  says Berendt -_: Kigozi ._. 
What is visibile is the effects the terror is having on society at large ._. 
The population is becoming increasingly polarized ._. 
Nigeria is populated roughly equally by Christians and Muslims ._. 
For one side ,_,  there's no doubt that it's all due to Islamist extremists ,_,  to Boko Haram ,_,  says Berendt -_: Kigozi ._. 
But for others it's far from clear ._. 
They do not believe that Islamists would kill fellow believers ._. 
And while Berendt -_: Kigozi hopes the Abuja bombing will unite Nigerians against terror ,_,  she fears that society will only become more polarized ._. 
The principal of a Nigerian school where 107 girls were abducted Wednesday is denying a military announcement that most of the girls have been recovered ._. Nigeria's Joint Information Center said late Wednesday that only eight of the abducted students were still missing ._. But Asabe Kwambura ,_,  the principal of the school the girls attended in Borno state ,_,  told VOA Thursday there is nothing in the military statement that is true ._. 
She said she only knows of 14 of the girls being released ,_,  and that the military and volunteers are continuing search efforts ._. A top official from Nigeria's Department of State Services in Maiduguri told VOA they also had no information about additional girls being released ._. 
The official said it is possible the military has its own information that he was not aware of yet ._. Advisor Reuben Abati said Wednesday that President Goodluck Jonathan was particularly concerned about the kidnapping ,_,  and had ordered security forces to deploy maximum efforts to rescue them ._. Mr ._. 
Jonathan also summoned his National Security Council to a Thursday meeting in Abuja in light of the kidnappings and a string of deadly attacks carried out by militants in order to review security measures and determine the best way forward ._. There were no initial claims of responsibility for the kidnappings ._. 
But the assault is similar to attacks that have been carried out by the Boko Haram Islamist militant group ._. In a statement ,_,  defense director Major General Chris Olukolade also said one of the terrorists who carried out the school attack had been captured ._. The incident took place on the same day that a bomb ripped through a crowded bus station in Abuja ,_,  killing at least 75 people ._. The government of the Borno state region announced it was offering a reward of nearly $300 ,_, 000 for information leading to the rescue of the abducted school girls ._. In a VOA interview ,_,  Nigerian Union of Teachers chairman Dauda Maina pleaded for the students' safe return and for the government to improve school security ._. We are very saddened and we totally condemn the abduction of those school children and we are begging the government to help the people ._. 
Our advice is that security measures must be improved ._. 
All those schools needed to be fenced so that there will be an entrance and an exit into the school as opposed to how they are just open buildings in the middle of nowhere ._. An unidentified parent in the region urged the kidnappers to free the girls ._. We ,_,  the parents ,_,  are really shocked ._. 
Please ,_,  please ,_,  please have mercy ._. 
Be merciful and release those children ._. The abductions were also condemned by United Nations Secretary -_: General Ban Ki -_: moon's office ._. 
Abuja ,_,  Nigeria � After the worst attack in Abuja's history on Monday ,_,  officials say the Nigerian capital has been secured for the World Economic Forum for Africa next month ._. 
These comments come amid conflicting statements on the abduction of more than 100 schoolgirls ,_,  and ongoing violence in the north ._. 
President Goodluck Jonathan summoned his security council ._. The Nigerian capital is simultaneously recovering from a bombing that killed 75 people in the suburbs on Monday ,_,  and preparing for the World Economic Forum for Africa  -_:  which is expected to draw more than 1 ,_, 000 delegates ,_,  including many heads of state ._. Minister of National Planning Ambassador Bashir Yuguda said Thursday there is no need for concern ._. 
Security will be beefed up ._. 
The security of the delegates coming  -_:  -_:  Nigeria is guaranteeing their security ._. 
We will do the best we can as a nation to do that because it's our responsibility to protect the lives of the delegates that are coming ._. Emergency ruleThree states in Nigeria's northeast have been under emergency rule for almost a year ,_,  after Jonathan said Islamist insurgents known as Boko Haram had captured territories ,_,  threatening the country's sovereignty ._. Initially ,_,  the military and police secured cities in the northeast ,_,  driving insurgents into the countryside and into the forest ._. 
The violence appears to be escalating ,_,  however ,_,  and rights groups say more than 1 ,_, 500 people have been killed this year alone ._. At this hospital in the capital ,_,  far from areas under emergency rule ,_,  patients recover from the bombing of the bus station on Monday ._. 
It was the largest attack in the city since the Boko Haram insurgency began in 2009 ,_,  and the first in two years ._. Like many of the victims ,_,  Sahadu is a civil servant who was catching a bus to work that morning ._. 
Also ,_,  like many of the victims ,_,  he said Boko Haram once was a northeastern issue ,_,  but the security crisis appears to be spreading ._. The truth about the violence in the northeast ,_,  though ,_,  often is hard to discern ._. Abducted schoolgirlsOn Wednesday night ,_,  the Nigerian military said no more than eight of 129 girls who were abducted in Borno state Monday remain missing ._. Other officials ,_,  however ,_,  say this is either untrue ,_,  or they have no knowledge of a rescue ._. 
On a scratchy phone line from a remote region in the northeast ,_, Government Girls Secondary School principal Asabe Kwambura said ,_,  We have not gotten any information that they have gotten the students yet ._. 
So all this information you got in the media is not true ._. The governor of Borno State ,_,  one of those under emergency rule ,_,  is offering a reward of about $300 ,_, 000 for information leading to a rescue ._. I want to assure you that we are willing to do anything to see that these innocent girls are rescued without any harm coming their way ,_,  said Governor Kashim Shettima ._. There were no initial claims of responsibility for the kidnappings ._. 
But the assault is similar to attacks that have been carried out by Boko Haram ._. The group has been blamed for thousands of deaths in attacks on churches ,_,  schools ,_,  mosques ,_,  markets ,_,  government structures and security forces ._. 
The group says it wants to impose its harsh version of Islamic law ,_,  which includes banning all forms of Western education ._. Abdulkareem Haruna contributed to this report from Maiduguri ._. 
Abuja � Peace remains a common denominator for the growth and development of any Country in the world ._. As global investments eludes Middle East and Asia ,_,  Africa remains the only option ._. 
Nigeria is the most populous black nation in the world with abundant mineral resources which make her an irresistible market for global investors ._. 
The threats that disrupts the peaceful co -_: existence of the an amalgamated nation of hundred years with over 170 ,_, 000 million citizens are been propagated by extreme vices from sea pirates in the south ,_,  kidnappers in the east ,_,  cybercrime in the west and boko haram in the north ._. Only one state has recorded a high level of sanity and peaceful co -_: existences and that is Akwa Ibom State ._.

Vexed by what he termed as false accusation aimed at smearing his image ,_,  former Head of State and a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress APC ,_,  Major -_: General Muhammadu Buhari ,_,  has issued a seven -_: day ultimatum to the Peoples Democratic Party PDP to retract its accusation linking him with Boko Haram and tender an unreserved public apology or face a legal action ._. In a statement he personally signed in Kaduna yesterday ,_,  Buhari said :_:  I cannot sit back and allow my image and that of my political party to be smeared by falsehood in the name of politics ._. He said the widely publicised and very serious allegations made against him by the PDP and its spokesman ,_,  Olisa Metuh ,_,  to the effect that his utterances were responsible for the current state of insecurity and terrorism bedevilling Nigeria ,_,  were absolutely without basis ._. To support his claim ,_,  Mr ._. 
Metuh engaged in twisted logic and outright distortion  -_:  which he called facts  -_:  in which he said that I ,_,  Gen ._. 
Muhammadu Buhari ,_,  beckoned on my 'supporters to go on lynching spree' should I lose the 2011 presidential election ,_,  as a result of which unprecedented violence broke out claiming the lives of hundreds of innocent people ._. I take very serious exception to this grave accusation against me by the PDP publicity secretary ._. 
It is a false allegation aimed at tarnishing my image and reputation in the hope of destroying my political and electoral standing ,_,  and that of my party ,_,  the APC ,_,  in the country ._. Firstly ,_,  it is public knowledge that Boko Haram as a terror organisation long preceded the 2011 presidential election ._. 
My utterances or lack of them on the 2011 presidential election could not therefore have created nor sustained the Boko Haram insurgency ._. Secondly ,_,  the PDP government of President Goodluck Jonathan constituted the Sheikh Ahmed Lemu Panel of Inquiry to investigate and report on the post -_: election violence in some parts of the country ._. 
The panel discharged its duties within its terms of reference and submitted its report to the president ._. This report was accepted by government and a white paper issued ._. 
Nowhere in that report ,_,  a product of thorough investigation of that unfortunate incident ,_,  was I mentioned in the remotest way to have uttered a word or acted in any form or manner that sparked off the violence ._. 
If I had ,_,  certainly that investigation would have uncovered it ._. 
The truth is that I had not ._. Thirdly ,_,  2011 was not the first time I contested a presidential election and was declared defeated ,_,  it was the third !_. 
If I had had no cause to 'beckon on my supporters to go on a lynching spree' in the two previous occasions ,_,  I would have had no cause to change in 2011 and I did not ,_,  Buhari said ._. The APC chieftain said Metuh also deliberately misquoted the interview he gave in Hausa on May 14 ,_,  2012 ,_,  in which he said the opposition was determined to fight in the 2015 elections ._. I used the Hausa idiom 'Kare jini ,_,  Biri jini' ,_,  which is a metaphor for a very tough fight ._. 
But ,_,  like the Islamic fundamentalist toga they falsely put on me because they cannot impinge on my personal and professional integrity ,_,  PDP apologists deliberately twisted this idiom to mean I called for violence ._. I am not a violent person and ,_,  other than my professional calling as a soldier ,_,  I have never been associated with violence ,_,  I abhor violence and have never advocated it ._. 
I have always been a law abiding person who insists on due process and the rule of law in all my private and public affairs ._. It is therefore a grave infraction on my person ,_,  personality and integrity that such a false and malicious accusation is being levelled against me by the PDP ._. 
This is dangerous politics by the ruling party and it must stop forthwith ,_,  Buhari said
A recent debate between the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress in Washington ,_,  the United States ,_,  did more harm than good to the nation's image ,_,  writes Shola OyeyipoThe rivalry between the ruling Peoples Democratic Party PDP and the All Progressives Congress APC in their quest to outwit each other went off the line of decency recently when spokespersons of the two parties confronted each other at a forum in Washington D ._. C ,_,  the United States ._. 
The platform for the debate ,_,  provided by the Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS ,_,  is a prominent bipartisan American think -_: tank based in Washington ,_,  D ._. C ._. The centre conducts policy studies and strategic analysis on political ,_,  economic and security issues throughout the world ,_,  with a specific focus on issues concerning international relations ,_,  trade ,_,  technology ,_,  finance ,_,  energy and geostrategy ._. 
Senior Special Assistant on Public Affairs in office of the President ,_,  Doyin Okupe PDP and the Publicity Secretary of the APC ,_,  Alhaji Lai Mohammed ,_,  who were supported by some others ,_,  spoke extensively on issues that border on the future of Nigeria and what to be expected ahead of the 2015 elections ._. 
Some Nigerian governors and senators were also at the event ._. Although not much of the event was televised ,_,  a foremost online media ,_,  Saharareporter was on the ground with its reporter ,_,  Adeola Fayehun ,_,  who also added pep to the situation with her thought -_: provoking questions ._. The debate was simply washing Nigeria's dirty linen in public as it soon degenerated into a war of words between the parties after blame and criticism were heaped on President Goodluck Jonathan ,_,  for the state of the nation ._. 
Mohammed ,_,  who led the opposition party ,_,  had maintained that President Jonathan was showing a complete lack of sincerity towards conducting free and fair elections in the country ._. 
He also placed the blame of Nigeria's backwardness on the doorstep of the PDP leadership ._. But the forum almost turned into a rowdy session when Okupe ,_,  who led the presidency and the PDP delegation warned opposition politicians not to bring the personality of the president into the discussion at the forum ._. 
Though Okupe had earlier claimed that he would not wash the country's dirty linen in public ,_,  he simply lost his mien when Mohammed pointed out the failure of the Jonathan -_: led administration to address transparency ,_,  including the alleged missing $20 billion oil revenue as well as the indiscretion of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC as some of the failings of the government ._. Responding ,_,  he said :_:  Alhaji Lai Mohammed should not cast aspersions on the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria because if he does that ,_,  he knows me and what I can do ._. 
Okupe presented the 2011 elections as the best in the country's history and one only dented by the violence inspired by opposition politicians ._. But at the time the Sahara Television had started to broadcast the exchange even though the programme was on ,_,  the Director of the CSIS Africa programme ,_,  Ms Jennifer Cooke ,_,  who moderated the talks ,_,  told Okupe that there has not been a precise sense of where the 2015 election preparation was headed ,_,  a question to which he responded to by stating :_:  The major part of the preparation will be done by INEC ._. He said his party did not have problems and did not have difficulty selling its manifesto to the people :_:  The APC is a new party ._. 
They have problem with their manifesto ._. 
We don't have that kind of problem ._. 
The PDP is an established party ,_,  deeply rooted ._. 
It is the only party you will find anywhere and everywhere in Nigeria ._. 
I'm not here to lie to you ._. 
This is the truth ._. 
We don't have that kind of problem ,_,  Okupe explained ._. He also said the Nigerian youths are not left with the choice of another party than the PDP on the grounds that the opposition has never had the experience of governance and that it is only desperate for power ._. What else can they the youths believe in ,_,  people who have not run government It is better for the young people to stick to the party that can help them ._. 
We have a new kid on the block in the person of President Goodluck Jonathan and he has started commendable reforms and it is better to allow him so that the full benefit of the reform can be something that young Nigerians can benefit from ._. But when asked how it intended to turn out an acceptable candidate ,_,  the APC through Senator Babafemi Ojudu ,_,  said for the coming election ,_,  it has a laid down people -_: oriented procedure for the emergence of its candidates ._. For instance ,_,  he said :_:  Our aspirants will be made to go through public debates with their opponents because in the past what we have had is that people are called to come and debate  -_:  running into election ,_,  they will run away ,_,  only to come and debate by themselves ._. 
Referring to President Jonathan ,_,  he asked :_:  Have you ever heard where a candidate will debate against himself That has happened in Nigeria ._. 
And he called some popular musicians to come and ask him questions ._. He added that the APC intended to present an acceptable candidate through an active participation of the people who will have the opportunity to ask those who aspire to lead the nation questions ._. We are going to call the rest of the world  -_:  for us to have a credible candidate  -_:  you must ask whoever is going to rule us to be ready to subject himself to questions from the people of the country ._. 
We are going to set that example in our party and we expect that when that election comes ,_,  people who are going to contest as candidates of other parties must also be ready to debate with our candidate ._. 
As the discussions progressed ,_,  Cooke continued to intervene as both sides tried to unearth the failings of each other ._. 
In fact ,_,  she was compelled to interject when Okupe raised issues on Mohammed's assertion of the administration's failures to address the spate of insecurity stoked by the Boko Haram sect ._. Mohammed said :_:  Insurgency is not a matter that can be politicised ,_,  unfortunately the government of the day has not been able to distinguish between the message and the messenger ,_,  faulting the president's failure to visit the war ravaged parts of the Northeastern Nigeria ._. But Okupe interjected :_:  I do not expect you to come to this forum to raise these issues; it is nonsense ,_,  he noted ._. 
While the debate ended with Mohammed urging the international community to pay keen attention to the election coming up next year with a view to identifying the credibility of the exercise ,_,  the duo of Okupe and Mohammed were further subjected to nerve -_: racking questions outside the arena ._. When asked how the federal government intends to market the new GDP rebasing to Nigerians ,_,  Okupe said the country's per capita income was low because Nigeria ,_,  as China ,_,  had very large population ._. 
China is the second largest economy in the world but because of the large population ,_,  the per capita income is lower ._. He defended some critical issues raised on the state of the nation and his personality ._. 
He said the current administration ,_,  in its drive to reduce youth unemployment ,_,  created 1 ._. 6million jobs ,_,  a statistic that was unacceptable to the reporter who said if such jobs were truly created ,_,  the recent episode of 19 job seekers' death should not have happened ._. Okupe contended that the rate of unemployment in the country had been so high that it rendered government's effort insignificant in addressing the immediate need of the people ._. 
He however assured the people that government would ensure a credible 2015 election ,_,  saying :_:  We will work hard for it and we are going to accept the result ._. 
Mohammed denied the much speculated Muslim -_: Muslim ticket of the APC ._. 
He maintained that The party is yet to have a convention ._. The party is yet to have its primary ,_,  so how did you come about Muslim -_: Muslim Nigeria's ambassador to the United States ,_,  Prof ._.  Ade Adefuye while summarising the discussions ,_,  praised both sides on the grounds that the articulation of the two parties was reflective of the high level of political discourse in Nigeria ._. 
He however warned them not to wash the country's image in public even as he raised questions about Nigerians coming to discuss their country in the United States ._. 
The claim by the Defence Headquarters DHQ that the military had secured the release of 107 schoolgirls who were abducted by members of Boko Haram has been disputed by the Borno State Government and the Principal of Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Mrs ._. 
Asabe Kwambura ._. One hundred and twenty nine girls were kidnapped from the school on Monday night by suspected members of the dreaded sect ._. 
However ,_,  14 of the students were able to escape when one of the trucks in which they were being carted away broke down ._. 
But as Nigerians and the rest of the world pondered their fate and prayed for their safe return ,_,  the DHQ on Wednesday announced that the military had secured the release of 107 girls from their abductors and even arrested one of them ._. 
It added that the manhunt was still ongoing for the eight remaining girls ._. But Thursday ,_,  the military's statement about the true fate of the girls was shown to be false ,_,  when a Borno State Government official who spoke to THISDAY and the principal of the college dismissed the claim by DHQ ._. Speaking on the BBC Hausa Service monitored in Maiduguri ,_,  Kwambura said other than the 14 students who escaped from the hold of the Boko Haram insurgents who abducted them from her school on Monday night ,_,  she was not aware that others had been released ._. 
She added that she had not held any discussion with DHQ spokesman ,_,  Brig ._. 
Gen ._. 
Chris Olukolade ,_,  who claimed otherwise ._. 
Olukolade in his statement on Wednesday had said 129 students were kidnapped from the school and had also claimed to be in touch with the principal ._. The defence ministry spokesman had said the soldiers ,_,  who after rescuing the students ,_,  had released them to their principal ._. 
But Kwambura in the BBC interview said nothing like that had happened ,_,  as none of the students was released to her by the military ._. 
The principal said nothing could be further from the truth than the information given by the DHQ ,_,  stressing that she had not told anyone ,_,  let alone the military ,_,  that most of the girls had been released except eight ._. She said the statement of the military was a blatant lie ,_,  I have not spoken to the Defence Headquarters spokesman ._. 
She maintained that only the 14 students who escaped from the hold of Boko Haram had been freed ._. It was also gathered that parents on hearing the news from DHQ that almost all the students had been freed ,_,  had thronged the school expecting to take their daughters home only to be told that the girls had not been rescued ._. 
Sources said most parents wept uncontrollably at having their hopes dashed and could not come to terms with the misinformation from the military hierarchy ._. One of the girls' parents ,_,  who spoke on the BBC also said :_:  We were disappointed with the statement coming from the Defence Headquarters' spokesman that the girls were rescued ._. 
Our children are still in the bush and if the military has failed ,_,  we will go after the insurgents ourselves even if it means sacrificing our lives ._. Similarly ,_,  a Borno State government official ,_,  who preferred to remain unnamed ,_,  said as far as they were concerned ,_,  only 14 of the girls who managed to escape from their abductors were returned to the secondary school and had been reunited with their parents ._. 
Other parents and the principal of the college ,_,  he told THISDAY ,_,  have been waiting anxiously for the other girls claimed to have been freed by the military ,_,  but had not been brought back to the school ._. He said it would be very unfortunate if the military was lying about something as sensitive as the whereabouts of over 100 missing girls ,_,  adding :_:  This is something that cannot be hidden and will be very shameful ._. To buttress the position of the Borno State government and the principal ,_,  the state Commissioner for Education ,_,  Alhaji Musa Inuwa Kubo ,_,  gave an update on the true status on the abducted girls ,_,  stating that 16 more girls had been brought to the school by their parents ,_,  bringing the number of girls who had been found to 30 ._. In a statement issued yesterday from the school premises ,_,  he said :_:  I'm right now at Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  the scene of the unfortunate abduction ._. 
At the moment ,_,  we have taken custody of 30 girls out of those abducted ._. There is an increase of 16 students whose parents returned them to school after they ran home on the day of the attack ._. 
We had made announcements and called on parents whose children and wards ran home to bring their wards back for proper enumeration ._. The aim is for us to take a proper account of our 129 students who were at the hostel on the day of that unfortunate attack ._. 
You may recall that 14 students had earlier escaped from captivity as explained by our governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima on Wednesday ._. 
By our records ,_,  of the 129 students at the hostel at the time of that unfortunate incident ,_,  we are expecting the return of about 99 students who might be among those said to have been rescued by the military ._. Myself ,_,  the principal of the school ,_,  Asabe Kwambura ,_,  parents ,_,  other students and residents are awaiting the return of our students ._. 
We have no reason to doubt or contradict Wednesday's announcement by the Defence Headquarters ,_,  given the fact that the military personnel are those leading the search and rescue operations along with civilian volunteers ._. We are very hopeful that perhaps ,_,  the freed students are safely with the military and being brought to us ._. 
We pray that not just all our students return in good health but also all the security agents and volunteers safely return in good health after a successful and patriotic rescue effort ._. We call on parents to remain prayerful and hopeful that by the grace of God all the students will return to us in good health ,_,  On behalf of the Borno State Government ,_,  my ministry ,_,  staff and students of the affected school ,_,  parents and relations of affected students ,_,  I deeply appreciate the concern of all Nigerians and rest of the world for their solidarity and well wishes ._. 
I also thank the media for their very critical role as we look forward to overcoming this grieving experience ._. Seeing the overwhelming evidence indicating that it had misinformed the Nigerian public and the rest of the world ,_,  the DHQ was eventually forced to retract its statement last night on the girls it had claimed the military saved from their abductors ._. 
In a statement issued by Olukolade ,_,  DHQ said :_:  The controversy that has been generated around the efforts at securing the lives of the abducted students of Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok is unfortunate ._. The ongoing frantic efforts of security forces along with vigilante groups including hunters working to locate and free the abducted students have continued to be keenly monitored at the Operation Centre of the Defence and Army Headquarters as regular progress reports are being received from troops on the ground ._. In this regard ,_,  a report was filed in from the field indicating that a major breakthrough had been recorded in the search ._. 
There was no reason to doubt this official channel ,_,  hence the information was released to the public immediately ._. Surprisingly ,_,  however ,_,  the school principal ,_,  one of the sources quoted in the report has denied all that was attributed to her for whatever reasons ._. 
This is an unfortunate development indeed ,_,  yet the Defence Headquarters would not want to join issues with anyone ._. It has to be reaffirmed ,_,  however ,_,  that the report forwarded to the public on this issue was in good faith and not intended to deceive the public as is being interpreted following the denials by the school principal and government of Borno State ._. Like all other citizens ,_,  the military is deeply concerned to ensure that the students are safe and freed alive ._. 
There is indeed no reason to play politics with the precious lives of the students ._. 
The number of those still missing is not the issue now as the life of every Nigerian is very precious ._. In the light of the denial by the principal of the school ,_,  the Defence Headquarters wishes to defer to the school principal and governor's statement on the number of students still missing and retract that aspect of the earlier statement while the search continues ._. In a related development ,_,  the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA Thursday released the names of the injured victims of the Nyanya bus park explosion who are currently receiving treatment in various hospitals in the Federal Capital Territory ._. 
The list issued by the Director -_: General ,_,  NEMA ,_,  Mohammed Sani Sidi ,_,  contained the names ,_,  gender ,_,  states of origin ,_,  age and phone numbers of the victims ._. 
Elections should hold in terror -_: stricken states of Yobe ,_,  Adamawa and Borno States next year ,_,  notwithstanding the insurgency in the zone ,_,  a group has said ._. According to the group ,_,  Northeast Democratic Network NDN ,_,  if the Monday bomb attack on a motor park in Nyanya ,_,  a suburb of Abuja ,_,  which killed 75 people and left over 124 others with injuries did not stop President Goodluck Jonathan to dance and campaign the next day at a rally in Kano by the Peoples Democratic Party PDP  ,_,  then ,_,  the spate of killings in the North -_: east should also not stop elections from holding in the zone as being canvassed by some government supporters ._. NDN ,_,  in a statement yesterday by its Coordinator ,_,  Mallam Mu'azu Ibrahim Misau ,_,  said its members took particular interest in the explanation given by Minister of Information ,_,  Mr ._. 
Labaran Maku ,_,  on Wednesday that Jonathan went ahead with the planned rally in Kano to prove to Boko Haram insurgents that their deadly activities would not hold back the country ._. It said :_:  What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander ._. 
We are happy that Maku ,_,  finally thought like our governors in the North -_: east who have repeatedly argued that should we exclude any part of Nigeria from the 2015 elections on account of Boko Haram ,_,  it means the sect can declare victory ._. 
In fact ,_,  we suspect that the sect members probably decided to resume extended attacks on other parts of Nigeria like Benue ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  Taraba ,_,  Plateau States and the most recent ,_,  Abuja ,_,  so that the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC might also consider suspending elections in most places like the commission is considering in parts of the North -_: east ._. The fact that President Jonathan chose to go ahead to Kano and dance to the music of Sani Danja in merriment and high spirit while hundreds of survivors of Abuja attacks painfully suffer on sick beds ,_,  just to prove a point to Boko Haram is even a lesser reason compared to the constitutional need for elections in every part of Nigeria ._. 
The group called on the president and Maku to oppose any attempt not to hold elections in the North -_: east in 2015 ,_,  unless if both the president and Maku merely showed insensitivity and deceived Nigerians by claiming they all went to Kano to sing and dance mainly to advance political interests at the expense of highly traumatised Nigerians in Abuja and other parts of the country ._. Misau called on all National Assembly members from the North -_: east and other patriotic Nigerians to oppose any act capable of undermining the electoral rights of the people ._. 
Senator Magnus Abe APC ,_,  Rivers has called on authorities of the West African Examination Council WEAC to organize special exams at a secured venue for the 129 girls that were abducted by the Boko Haram sect in Borno State ._. Speaking to Journalists in Abuja yesterday ,_,  Abe said the federal government should not allow the Boko Haram to truncate the future of the girls ._. We call on the federal government and particularly ,_,  the WAEC to help these girls write their final exams elsewhere ._. 
In doing so ,_,  they should provide enough security for them and make sure that if need be ,_,  they can be taken out of Borno and even bring them here to Abuja to conclude the exams ,_,  Abe said ._. The lawmaker said :_:  The dream of these girls shouldn't be thwarted by the Boko Haram ._. 
This is not a time for blame -_: game on any side but the whole nation should rise as one to ensure that the other girls in the custody of this sect are released and re -_: united with their parents ,_,  unharmed ._. The abducted teenagers were writing their Senior Secondary Certificate Examination at Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State when they were abducted by the insurgents at night ._. 
The National Conference finally adopted a Work Plan Thursday ,_,  with detailed activities and time -_: frame attached to such activities ._. Chairman ,_,  Justice Idris Kutigi rtd ,_,  who spoke at plenary shortly before adjourning indefinitely ,_,  however ,_,  said the document was adopted without any alteration based on necessity ._. The Work Plan obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria NAN ,_,  indicated that the committee work begins on Tuesday ,_,  April 22 and ends on Wednesday ,_,  April 30 ._. The Chairman ,_,  Justice Kutigi also informed the delegates that the committee work will begin on Tuesday after the Easter break ._. The announcement followed submission of list of the members and leadership of each of the 20 committees to the plenary amidst complaints and applause from a cross -_: section of the delegates ._. Some delegates however protested the short time allotted to committee work ,_,  pointing out that they were expected to do an exhaustive and thorough job ._. Kutigi however ,_,  appealed to them to get down to work first and if there was a need for extension ,_,  the necessary representation could be made to the appropriate quarters ._. He said the Work Plan was drawn based on the time allotted to the conference by the federal government ._. The chairman said even the general public could misunderstand any attempt at arbitrary adjustment ._. 
He assured that everything would be done to ensure that lack of time did not hinder the justification of the conference ._. The chairman urged delegates to properly articulate their points at the committee level and be open to suggestions from others ._. 
The work plan also indicated that the conference would receive reports from committees and commence deliberations on May 5 and 6 ._. It will go on break from May 7 to 9 to enable members participate in the World Economic Forum ,_,  which would hold in Abuja ._. 
Deliberation on the various committee reports will resume on May 12 and last till 15 when deliberations were expected to be completed ._. From May 19 to 29 ,_,  the conference's secretariat ,_,  working with the Report Drafting Committee ,_,  will put the reports together and present such to the conference in plenary ._. 
Consideration and adoption of the draft reports by the conference in plenary will start on June 2 and end on the 12 ._. According to the work plan ,_,  the final report will be produced and signed between June 16 and 19 ._. 
The chairman informed delegates that 10 of the 20 committees would hold their sessions at the National Judicial Institute ,_,  while the remaining 10 would sit at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers ._. It was agreed through a voice vote that delegates with genuine complaints on the composition of the committees ,_,  both the membership and the chairmen ,_,  co -_: chairmen and deputy chairmen should sort out the details with the secretariat ._. He however explained that ,_,  while such genuine complaints were being sorted out ,_,  normal committee sittings would commence as scheduled and that the process would not affect deliberations and decisions of committees ._. At the commencement of sitting on Thursday Kutigi informed the delegates that some of them might find their names in committees they did not indicate interest and that they should face the challenge of serving in such committees in the interest of the nation ._. Most of the members indicated interest in four out of the twenty committees ,_,  a situation that led to redistribution into other committees since all the committees must have members ._. 
More than 45 per cent of the members indicated interest in the committees on Devolution of Power ,_,  Political Restructuring ,_,  Politics and Governance ,_,  Party and Election Matters and National Security ._. In spite of the hue about Religion ,_,  not up to 18 delegates indicated interest in the committee Delegates yesterday erronously commended the federal government ,_,  security agencies and the people of Borno State for rescuing a good number of the girls when their abductors were still holding them captive ._. After a short deliberation on the conference work plan ,_,  delegates agreed to dissolve into committees from Tuesday ,_,  brushing aside request for extension of time ._. Leading the debate at the plenary session yesterday ,_,  prominent Lagos lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria SAN ,_,  Mr ._. 
Femi Falana ,_,  said that the federal government and security forces needed to be commended along with the gallant members of the Civilian Joint Task Force in Borno State for securing the release of 129 of the girls kidnapped last Monday by suspected Boko Haram terrorists ._. Speaking under a matter of urgent national importance ,_,  Falana said :_:  This morning we read that majority of the girls have been released ._. 
The armed forces and people of Borno State have rescued the children ._. 
I am urging this house to commend the efforts of the armed forces and the people of Borno state in rescuing majority of these girls ,_,  while we are calling for the intensification of efforts for the release of the remaining eight girls ._. The motion was seconded by Mrs ._. 
Josephine Anenih ,_,  who said the progress made at rescuing the girls ,_,  which was supported by the civilian JTF clearly justified calls for concerted effort by the local leaders to help checkmate the insurgents ._. Majority of the delegates hailed the motion and it was agreed that the secretariat sends its commendation on behalf of the delegates to the government ._. However ,_,  THISDAY checks revealed that the girls were still being held by the insurgents ._. 
The conference had expressed outrage over the bomb blast in Nyanya Bus Park and subsequent kidnapping of the schoolgirls in an all girls secondary school in Chibok ,_,  Borno State ._. One of the delegates from Taraba State and former Minister of Water Resources ,_,  Mrs ._. 
Helen Jakanda made an emotional appeal for the conference to urge the federal government to immediately deploy security forces to restore order in Wukari Town ._. She said the town was presently under siege by invading terrorists ,_,  which had led to a 24 -_: hour curfew that had put enormous pressure on the social and economic live of the people ._. Right now Wukari is under siege and there is a 24 -_: hour curfew in the place ._. 
People cannot come out from their house and they do not have food ._. 
It is an invasion that the people are experiencing now and the invaders came in their thousands and are killing and maiming innocent people ,_,  she said ._. With the concerns and the debates on insecurity over ,_,  attention of the delegates was shifted to the work of the committees ._. 
A delegate ,_,  Muhammed Maigadi from Sokoto State ,_,  faulted the committees' work plan ,_,  saying that four days will not be enough for the plenary to fully discuss the reports of the 20 committees ._. A delegate ,_,  Abubakar Gigiwa said time for the secretariat to prepare its report should be reduced and added to the time for committees work so as to give enough time for proper job to be done ._. He also suggested the use of the two -_: day World Economic summit for committees work ._. 
He suggested that some adjustments on the committee composition be made in line with the complaints already made ._. 
Some of the delegates even suggested a move to request for the extension of time so that the committees can do a thorough work ._. However ,_,  former Minister of Health ,_,  Prof ._.  ABC Nwosu tried to redirect the focus of debate on the need to respect the time frame allocated for the conference and that delegates should not give the impression to the public that all they want was an extension of time for selfish reasons ._. Nwosu said he would not subscribe to any request for the extension of the time of the conference because members of the public may think that delegates were seeking extension for pecuniary interest and could misconstrue any such move ._. 
According to him ,_,  the various committees should resolve to work very hard within the limits of the time and deliver it's report as scheduled ._. At this stage ,_,  the Chairman called the conference to order and appealed to delegates to go for the committee work first and that the issue of time frame can be handled when the need arose ._. He said the work plan for the conference was prepared and given to the secretariat at the commencement of sitting and that efforts should be made to stick to it ._. 
Kutigi who informed the house that the conference will break  -_:  off for the World Economic Forum between May 7 and 9 ._. The conference therefore adopted the work plan through a voice vote with Kutigi assuring that it was subject to adjustment as the need may arise but that for now the various committees will proceed on their assignment as planned by Tuesday ._. At about 11 ._. 29 a ._. m ._.  ,_,  former Governor of Akwa Ibom State ,_,  Obong Victor Attah moved for adjournment of the plenary ._. 
Former head of state Gen ._. 
Muhammadu Buhari has issued a seven -_: day ultimatum to the People's Democratic Party PDP to retract its wild accusation linking him with the Boko Haram acts ,_,  and apologise or face a legal action ._. In a statement he personally signed in Kaduna yesterday ,_,  Gen ._. 
Buhari said :_:  I cannot sit back and allow my image ,_,  and that of my political party be smeared by falsehood in the name of politics ._. He said the very serious allegations made against him by the PDP and its spokesman Olisa Metuh ,_,  to the effect that his utterances were responsible for the current state of insecurity and terrorism bedeviling Nigeria ,_,  were without basisTo support his claim ,_,  Mr ._. 
Metuh engaged in twisted logic and outright distortion  -_:  which he called facts  -_:  in which he said that I ,_,  Gen ._. 
Muhammadu Buhari ,_,  beckoned on my 'supporters to go on lynching spree' should I lose the 2011 presidential election ,_,  as a result of which 'an unprecedented violence broke out claiming the lives of hundreds of innocent people ._. I take very serious exception to this grave accusation against me by the PDP Publicity Secretary ._. 
It is a false allegation aimed at tarnishing my image and reputation in the hope of destroying my political and electoral standings ,_,  and that of my party ,_,  the APC ,_,  in the country ._. Firstly ,_,  it is public knowledge that Boko Haram as a terror organisation long preceded the 2011 presidential elections ._. 
My utterances or lack of them on the 2011 presidential election could not therefore have created nor sustained the Boko Haram insurgency ._. Secondly ,_,  the PDP Government of President Goodluck Jonathan constituted the Sheikh Ahmed Lemu Panel of Inquiry to investigate and report on the post -_: election violence in some parts of the country ._. 
The panel discharged its duties within its terms of reference and submitted its Report to the President ._. 
This Report was accepted by government and a Whitepaper issued ._. 
Nowhere in that Report ,_,  a product of thorough investigation of that unfortunate incident ,_,  was I mentioned in the remotest way to have uttered a word or acted in any form or manner that sparked off the violence ._. 
If I had ,_,  certainly that investigation would have uncovered it ._. 
The truth is that I had not ._. Thirdly ,_,  2011 was not the first time I contested a presidential election and was declared defeated ,_,  it was the third !_. 
If I had had no cause to 'beckon on my supporters to go on lynching spree' in the two previous occasions ,_,  I would have had no cause to change in 2011  -_:  and I did not ,_,  Gen ._. 
Buhari said ._. The APC chieftain said the PDP National Publicity Secretary also deliberately misquoted the interview he gave in Hausa on May 14 ,_,  2012 in which he said the opposition was determined to fight in the 2015 elections ._. I used the Hausa idiom 'Kare jini ,_,  Biri jini' ,_,  which is a metaphor for a very tough fight ._. 
But ,_,  like the Islamic fundamentalist toga they falsely put on me because they cannot impinge on my personal and professional integrity ,_,  PDP apologists deliberately twisted this idiom to mean I called for violence ._. I am not a violent person and ,_,  other than my professional calling as a soldier ,_,  I have never associated with violence ,_,  I abhor violence and have never advocated it ._. 
I have always been a law abiding person who insists on due process and the rule of law in all my private and public affairs ._. It is therefore a grave infraction to my person ,_,  personality and integrity that such a false and malicious accusation is being leveled against me by the PDP ._. 
This is dangerous politics by the ruling party and it must stop forthwith ,_,  Gen ._. 
Buhari said ._. 
The base year for computing Nigeria's GDP has now been officially shifted from 1990 to 2010 ._. 
By 2016 government says the base year would shift to 2015 and every five years thereafter ._. 
In a country devoid of good news there was palpable excitement on the part of Nigerians and the federal government ._. 
Something positive is coming out of 'Bethlehem' ._. 
With the excitement over ,_,  the time for sober reflection and introspection is here ._. 
Following the rebasing of the GDP ,_,  the estimated size of the Nigerian economy in 2013 is now US$510 billion N80 ._. 22 trillion with a per capita income of $2 ,_, 688 ._. The rebased nominal GDP for 2013 represents an increase of 89 ._. 22% over the nominal GDP using the old base year ._. 
This rebased GDP makes Nigeria the 26th largest economy in the world and in terms of GDP per capita it is the 121st in the world ._. 
By rebasing the economy ,_,  the composite sectors of the economy increased from 37 to 46 meaning that more sectors like telecommunications ,_,  entertainment ,_,  motion pictures ,_,  vehicle assembly ,_,  ICT and a few others were added ._. 
It is gratifying to note that the structure of the Nigerian economy is changing and the dramatic rise in the share of services in the nominal GDP has displaced the old belief that agriculture was the largest contributor to Nigeria's GDP ._. In the 2013 human development report ,_,  Nigeria is ranked 153 out of 186 countries in the world ._. 
Despite the rebased GDP ,_,  Nigeria ,_,  according to the World Bank ,_,  is one of the five countries with the largest concentration of poor people in the world ._. 
In Nigeria ,_,  60% of its people or over 100 million Nigerians live on less than $1 ._. 25 per day which has become the measure for extreme poverty ._. With the rebased economy ,_,  in the best of times ,_,  Nigeria generates about 4 ,_, 000 megawatts or less of public electricity to power the 26th biggest economy in the world ._. 
While announcing results of the rebasing ,_,  the National Bureau of Statistics NBS announced that growth in GDP is not synonymous with increase in job creation and that increase in the overall economic output of a country does not necessarily mean increase in incomes of individuals ._. 
Actually ,_,  the Statistician -_: General of Nigeria was actually referring to the contradictions inherent in the Nigerian situation because all over the world the experience is exactly the opposite of what he said ._. The rebased economy ran shy of telling Nigerians the unemployment rate in the country but even without taking the trouble to give us the estimate ,_,  we know that the composite unemployment rate is about 30% while the youth unemployment rate is nearly 50% ._. 
Nigeria is now the largest economy in Africa beating South Africa to a distant second but Nigeria's newly derived GDP per capita of $2 ,_, 688 still lags behind South Africa ,_,  Egypt and Tunisia ._. 
Let me quickly add that the last base year used to compute the GDP of the South African economy was 1998 ._. 
But does this all mean that the rebased Nigerian GDP is meaningless Not really but it weighs President Goodluck Jonathan's burden ._. Nigerians already knew that the country is blessed with bountiful resources but with corrupt and unsympathetic leaders ._. 
The rebased GDP is not a gimmick ._. 
It truly represents the Nigerian economy using prices of 2010 ._. 
In 2014 ,_,  the 2010 prices have changed already ._. 
So the economy is even bigger now than it was in 2010 ._. 
To arrive at the new GDP data ,_,  every known and respectable organisation was involved ._. 
The UN ,_,  IMF ,_,  World Bank ,_,  ADB ,_,  local and international economists and a painstaking NBS were involved ._. 
It was therefore a job well done ._. 
However ,_,  it is the best case yet of what classical economics calls growth without development ._. 
This expression is a fundamental measure of the wellbeing of a society ._. 
Having rebased its GDP ,_,  Nigerian economy became larger than the economy of Austria ,_,  Malaysia and Indonesia amongst others ._. The South Africans have jeered at our new size and have described the economy as a big house on faulty foundation ._. 
The Nigerian economy remains empty without infrastructure ._. 
An economy that has no intra -_: city rail service ,_,  an economy where no city can boast of potable water across the length and breadth of its city limits ,_,  an economy that accounts for 10% of global infant and maternal mortality rate cannot in good conscience relish at a huge size devoid of quality ._. 
The rebased Nigerian GDP is like the situation of a supposedly wealthy man whose house leaks from every corner and the children cannot eat ,_,  cannot go to school ,_,  cannot visit the hospital when ill ,_,  have no clothes to wear and have no water to drink and yet the man is described as rich ._. The NBS says that rebasing will give the Nigerian government tools to better tackle the challenges of growing the economy and fighting poverty ._. 
It is vital that Nigerians know what it is to be the 26th largest economy in the world by GDP ._. 
It means Nigeria has an economy bigger than Austria's ._. 
Austria is a European economy and it is one of the 10 most comfortable countries in the world ._. 
Let us look at Austria so that the Nigerian president and his government know what Nigerians expect from an economy with Nigeria's new GDP ._. In 2012 ,_,  Austria was one of the countries surveyed by the OECD on life satisfaction index ._. 
Out of the OECD countries in Asia ,_,  Europe ,_,  America and Australia 10 countries were selected as the world's happiest countries and their citizens as the world's most satisfied citizens ._. 
Seven parameters were applied viz :_:  life satisfaction ,_,  employment rate ,_,  self -_: reported good health ,_,  employees working long hours ,_,  disposable income ,_,  educational attainment and life expectancy ._. These measures of quality further examined homicide rate ,_,  sense of feeling safe walking home at night ,_,  quality of drinking water etc ._.  Ten countries stood out as the happiest in the world namely Denmark ,_,  Norway ,_,  Netherlands ,_,  Switzerland ,_,  Austria ,_,  Israel ,_,  Finland ,_,  Australia ,_,  Canada and Sweden ._. 
In the case of Austria ,_,  whose GDP is way below Nigeria's rebased GDP ,_,  its life satisfaction score was 7 ._. 5 out of 10 meaning that 75% of its people were happy with their life conditions ._. 
82% of Austrians were happy with the level and quality of educational attainment and a self -_:  reported good health score of 69% ._. 
Life expectancy of the Austrian in 2012 was 80 ._. 7 years with a feel -_: safe factor of 70% ,_,  a homicide rate of 2 ._. 1 murders per 100 ,_, 000 ,_,  and 5% unemployment rate ._. 
Yet Austria's GDP is less than Nigeria's rebased GDP ._. The challenge for President Jonathan is to better the lot of Nigerians on the heels of the rebased GDP ._. 
Reporting a huge GDP cannot be an end in itself ._. 
GDP must mean growth and development ._. 
It must mean good health ,_,  good roads ,_,  good education ,_,  good electricity supply ,_,  good housing ,_,  good food and extremely low corruption ._. 
John Adams ,_,  the 18th century American statesman says that The happiness of society is the end of government ._. 
Arguing further ,_,  Eleanor Roosevelt ,_,  author ,_,  speaker and wife of a former American President Franklin D ._. 
Roosevelt ,_,  said :_:  Happiness is not a goal; it's a by -_: product ._. 
Therefore for Nigerian citizens to appreciate their rebased status ,_,  the government must invest considerable energy and resources in building and developing systems and structures that would guarantee the happiness they seek ._. 
Nigerians must benefit from the growth of their economy ._. 
A GDP of $510 billion must translate into a better society for Nigerians ._. 
The federal government should develop a list of quick wins or low hanging fruits to harvest on the strength of a rebased economy ._. The unemployment rate should be the first casualty of a rebased GDP ._. 
The Nigerian constitution provides that the federal government shall operate a mixed economy model of development ._. 
It means both the public and private sectors must play a role in its development ._. 
The federal government and other state governments should borrow a leaf from the Lagos State government to see how a government can gainfully engage in the productive sector of the economy ._. 
The business of government is both in business and government ._. 
Government has business in business ._. 
As it provides enabling environment to the private sector ,_,  it must make the public sector responsive to society ._. The federal and state governments should clear the streets of unemployed graduates of universities ,_,  polytechnics and colleges of education immediately ._. 
In 1986/87 ,_,  faced with a crushing unemployment problem ,_,  the federal government under military President Ibrahim Babangida opened up the civil service and ordered mass recruitment of staff into the service ._. 
In no time unemployment ceased to be a problem and some of those recruited graduates today are directors in the federal service ._. To start ,_,  all establishment positions in the MDAs should be filled ._. 
For every ghost worker fished out ,_,  a true person must be recruited in its place ._. 
Nigerians must be allowed to guide the growth of this economy by supervising ,_,  regulating ,_,  monitoring and overseeing different aspects of the system ._. 
The ministries must be alive to their mandate because they were not set up to simply award contracts ._. 
For example with the array of professionals ,_,  the ministry of works should build roads ,_,  bridges ,_,  culverts etc and the housing ministry must build houses for the poor ._. 
An economy this big must have a civil service twice the size of what we currently have ._. 
The finance and economy minister must now listen to the voice of reason ._. A rebased economy of $510 billion is reflective of an endowed nation ._. 
President Jonathan must act to engrain his footsteps in the sands of time ._. 
Governments ,_,  as the Chinese government does ,_,  must now set up state farms at strategic locations in the country ._. 
We have the labour for it ._. 
The Nigerian borders with Chad ,_,  Niger ,_,  Benin republic and Cameroun must be fully protected now and in the future ._. 
The Boko Haram menace is an opportunity to beef up the physical strength of the security services ._. The armed forces and the police will benefit from new recruits ._. 
The federal government should set up a new agency called 'Border Guards and recruit a minimum of 100 ,_, 000 young Nigerians to be deployed across the country's border posts ._. 
The border guards would undergo a six -_: month paramilitary training ,_,  properly armed and be the go -_: between the police and the army at border control points ._. 
A huge economy needs security ._. 
Similarly ,_,  let the federal government provide seed money to build two new refineries in the next 24 -_: 36 months ._. 
The idea of government -_: owned refineries is acceptable to President Jonathan ._. When he visited Namibia last month ,_,  the federal government and the Republic of Namibia proposed to construct a joint oil refinery in Walvis Bay ,_,  Namibia ,_,  to maximise cooperation in the area of energy ._. 
Good idea but charity begins at home ._. 
If the petroleum unions see the government building new refineries to be technically operated jointly for 30 years by foreign partners ,_,  the idea of selling the old refineries in a transparent way will be good news to them ._. 
New refineries will create jobs and end fuel importation ._. 
Petroleum subsidies should go and the nearly N2 trillion spent annually on it will be ploughed into job creation and development ._. 
In this way ,_,  the rebased economy will have meaning for Nigerians ._. The author was a former MD/CEO of Liberty Bank Plc ._. 
DEPUTY National Chairman South of the All Progressives Congress APC ,_,  Senator Annie Okonkwo spoke to some reporters in Lagos on burning national issues such as the challenges in the APC and how the party can win forthcoming elections ,_,  the National Conference ,_,  why the Peoples Democratic Party PDP and APC must join forces to fight Boko Haram and insecurity instead of trading accusations ._. On accusations and counter -_: accusation between PDP and APC over insecurity in the country ._. Boko Haram is the worst thing that has happened to this country and we must do something about it ._. 
Sometimes ,_,  I get baffled that :_:  why can't we as a nation go in and smoke them out once and for all Whatever we can do to smoke all the Boko Haram out ,_,  let us do it and know that nobody talk about Boko Haram anymore ._. The truth of the matter is that sometimes ,_,  I wonder how people for so many years would continue to hold the nation on hostage ._. 
When there was Biafran war ,_,  within 30 months ,_,  the war ended and everybody came together and we became one ._. Nigerians came together to fight the civil war ,_,  so why can't we come together and fight Boko Haram once and for all It is so embarrassing and it is not good for our nation ._. Insecurity situationToday ,_,  we are talking about our GDP ,_,  economy ,_,  how can we boost our economy when some parts of the country are in disarray So ,_,  it is something that I think we must come together and fight once and for all ._. Don't you think your party needs to work with the ruling PDP to solve the problemThe insecurity situation in the country is what everybody must put hands together and solve ._. 
Whether you are APC or PDP ,_,  no party is happy with the way Boko Haram is terrorising Nigerians ._. 
You don't know who is next ._. 
Boko Haram doesn't spare people whether they are Muslims or Christians ._. 
So ,_,  we must unite to fight the insurgents ._. On APC's perceived double speak on the National ConferenceAPC as a party decided that they are not going to be involved but that does not mean that the states are not going to send their representatives to the conference ._. APC as a party believes that the conference is a waste of time because previous conferences were not implemented ._. Now ,_,  a lot of issues are coming up ._. 
Some delegates are saying that the outcome should be subjected to a referendum and that it should not be sent to the National Assembly ._. 
Some people also see it as Jonathan's political strategy to win the minds of the people ahead of the 2015 general election ._. Political strategyPersonally ,_,  I am not against the conference but my concern is for the outcome to be implemented ._. 
As a person ,_,  I believe that Nigerians should sit down and talk ._. 
I support it but my concern is that after this talk ,_,  what do we do with it I am also afraid that there might not be any useful thing that would come out of it ._. So ,_,  is the APC right in boycotting the national conferenceAs a political party and the major opposition party ,_,  it is better for APC to stay aside and watch but that does not mean that the governors would not send their representatives to the conference because they are not representing APC ,_,  they are representing the states ._. On how the National Assembly can make the outcome of the National Conference yield resultsThe National Assembly has nothing to do because the truth of the matter is that if there is any amendment the people want ,_,  it goes through constitutional amendment and there is a procedure for amending the constitution ,_,  which is very rigorous ._. 
It is not just for the National Assembly to amend it; they don't have all the powers to do that ._. 
It would still have to go to the states ._. 
One of the best things that can happen is if it is subjected to a referendum ._. On whether APC can produce a formidable candidate that can challenge President Jonathan in 2015APC is working towards that ._. 
Nobody can predict what is going to happen in 2015 but I can assure Nigerians that APC's convention will produce a presidential candidate that Nigerians would accept ._. 
APC will produce a candidate that has the people at heart ,_,  a candidate that will transform the country ._. 
APC will dislodge PDP in 2015 ._. On his assessment of the on -_: going congresses of the APCI am not happy over what happened during the ward congress especially in Anambra State ._. 
The state congress committee chairman ,_,  Chief Ezennia Ogbuehi ,_,  sidelined some members of the committee assigned by the party to conduct the congress and conducted the congress without following due process and guidelines of the congress ._. 
Honestly ,_,  I was disappointed ._. The party promised to operate on internal democracy and that equal opportunities would be given to all members of the party but most of the aspirants were not allowed to participate in the congress ._. 
I believe it is something that should not to be allowed to happen in our party because Nigerians see APC as the only alternative party that can transform the country ._. Nigerians are really looking forward to APC as a party that is going to bring true change ._. I want us to use this opportunity to call on all our party faithful wherever they are to imbibe true democratic principles and subject themselves to internal democracy ._. Internal democracyThat is the only way we can build a solid party that Nigerians would have confidence in but if we continue to do what other political parties are doing ,_,  it is not going to augur well for us ._. I was excited when the party came out openly on the pages of national dailies to state the process of the congresses ._. 
The guidelines are very transparent and it shows that the party is ready to imbibe internal democracy ._. But what happened during the congress especially in Anambra State was undemocratic ._. 
Someone who was appointed as the chairman of the congress committee messed up the whole process and despite the party guidelines and good intentions ,_,  the congress committee chairman acted contraryToday ,_,  it is on record that all Anambarians are highly disappointed in the chairman of the congress committee ,_,  who completely ignored the party's guidelines and started perpetuating what he was not told to do by the party ._. I think it is a lesson and we cannot continue like that ._. 
I think this is an opportunity for the party to really look into the state and see that the problem is resolved ._. 
What happened in the last election in Anambra is all about disunity and we must make sure that APC is united in all states to be able to confront the Peoples Democratic Party PDP in 2015 and the only way to do that is to build a solid foundation ._. On how the party leadership can build a solid foundation for the APCAPC is a very big party and there is no doubt that there is going to be some elements who are not ready to abide by the principles of internal democracy but the party should rise up and identify those elements ._. 
The good news is that APC has a vision and the party constitution is very clear ._. 
They must realise that it is very important that for the party to grow ,_,  there must be true internal democracy ._. On comments that APC cannot truly be an alternative to PDP because it was built on faulty foundation and is now a dumping ground for people who were rejected in the ruling PDP ,_,  who they accept without screening and scrutinyFirst of all ,_,  you should understand that there is freedom of association ,_,  so ,_,  there is no question of screening somebody to be a member of a party ._. 
The constitution gives you the right to belong to anywhere you want ._. A member of the party cannot stop anyone from being a member of a party and nobody can also suspend anybody unless you go against the constitution or guidelines of the party ._. And again ,_,  the party cannot say that people who want to join the party should not join ,_,  but the most important thing is that there is a principle and constitution of the party ._. 
I believe the only way the party can be strengthened is when the party works with the constitution and manifesto of the party ,_,  especially during the party's congresses and convention ._. I am happy the way APC put up their guidelines ,_,  which shows that for you to aspire as executive in the ward you will have to pay at least N2 ,_, 000 to show a commitment ._. 
What that means is that anybody who comes and pays that N2 ,_, 000 has procured the right to participate in the congress and any attempt by member or some members of the party not to allow the person to participate is undemocratic and that is exactly what has happened in Anambra State and I condemn it with all sincerity of purpose ._. 
Senator Magnus Abe ,_,  representing Rivers South -_: east senatorial district in the National Assembly ,_,  yesterday appealed to the federal government to extend the ongoing Senior Secondary Certificate Examination SSCE in the interest of 129 female students of Government Girls' College ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State ,_,  who were abducted on Tuesday by insurgents ._. Abe said in Abuja that he was impressed by the courage and determination of the girls to acquire knowledge despite the threat to education from Boko Haram in the North -_: east ._. Boko Haram insurgents had abducted 129 female students of the school in Borno State who were writing their SSCE ._. Also reacting to the abduction of the schoolgirls ,_,  a Lagos -_: based activist lawyer ,_,  Mr ._. 
Femi Falana SAN ,_,  called on the federal government to close Nigeria's borders with Cameroun ,_,  Niger and Chad as a first step towards tackling the insurgency ._. The senator who condemned the incident ,_,  said in the effort to ensure that their quest for education was not thwarted ,_,  he and some other senators were planning to set up a scholarship scheme for them ._. 
The scheme ,_,  he said ,_,  would be in collaboration with the girls' parents and other Nigerians with the aim of ensuring that the students continue their education in other parts of the country ._. He said :_:  The dream of these girls shouldn't be thwarted by the Boko Haram ._. 
This is not a time for blame game on any side but the whole nation should rise as one to ensure that the other girls in the custody of this sect should be released and re -_: united with their parents ,_,  unharmed ._. We should all work with the Borno State Government to secure the release of the remaining girls ._. 
We are also parents and we plead that the dream of these girls should not be allowed to end because of this incident ._. I'm calling on Nigerians to raise funds for these girls so that they can go to other parts of the country to continue with their education ._. I've spoken with my colleagues and they are ready to partner the parents of these girls and indeed ,_,  all other interested parties to make sure that these girls receive the education they so earnestly desire ._. In his reaction to the abduction of the pupils ,_,  Falana has called on the federal government to immediately close Nigerian borders with Cameroun ,_,  Niger Republic and Chad as an immediate effort to mitigate the activities of Boko Haram ._. Falana in a statement yesterday ,_,  urged the military to intensify efforts at freeing the schoolgirls from captivity ._. 
While demanding the immediate release of the remaining victims of the dastardly act ,_,  I wish to call on the federal government to embark on the closure of the country's borders with Cameroun ,_,  Niger and Chad ,_,  he said ._. According to him ,_,  by closing the country's borders with Cameroun ,_,  Niger and Chad  ,_,  Nigeria will be better secure ._. 
Abuja � SENATORS ,_,  yesterday ,_,  pleaded with the Federal Government and authorities of the West African Examinations Council ,_,  WAEC ,_,  to ensure that the educational aspirations of the female students of Government Girls College ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State that were abducted and now released by suspected Boko Haram insurgents were not truncated ._. The senators also pleaded with those holding the remaining eight female students to release them as they were innocent and had not committed any crime that could warrant such trauma they are subjected to ._. Making the appeal in Abuja through Senator Magnus Abe representing Rivers South East ,_,  the senators specifically appealed to government and WAEC to find another school or centre where the girls can write their final papers elsewhere in the state or alternatively the Federal Capital Territory ._. Final examsSenator Abe said government must not allow the Boko Haram sect score victory of any kind over the students by allowing them to forge ahead with the dream of acquiring education ._. He said ,_,  We call on the Federal Government and particularly ,_,  WAEC to help these girls write their final exams elsewhere ._. 
In doing so ,_,  they should provide enough security for them to write their exams and also ,_,  make sure that if need be ,_,  they can be taken out of Borno and even bring them here to Abuja to conclude the exams ._. The dream of these girls shouldn't be thwarted by the Boko Haram ._. 
This is not a time for blame -_: game on any side but the whole nation should rise as one to ensure that the other girls in the custody of this sect are released and re -_: united with their parents ,_,  unharmed ._. 
We should all work with the Borno State Government to secure the release of the remaining girls ._. 
We are also parents and we plead that the dream of these girls should not be allowed to end because of this unfortunate and harrowing incident ._. It will be recalled that the Boko Haram insurgents ,_,  Tuesday ,_,  abducted about 100 female students of a public school in Borno State who were writing their West African School Certificate examinations ._. 
The abducted students ,_,  according to security sources ,_,  were among the over 250 WAEC/SSCE candidates of Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  Chibok in the southern part of Borno ._. 
Benin � Former governor of Edo State ,_,  Chief John Odigie -_: Oyegun ,_,  yesterday ,_,  described the allegation of embezzlement of campaign funds levelled against Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso of Kano State by President Goodluck Jonathan as ridiculous ._. He said that rather than accuse the governor of embezzlement of campaign funds ,_,  the President should first arrest those who were involved in the pension fund saga and the alleged missing N20 billion from the Federation Account ._. Oyegun ,_,  in a chat with Vanguard ,_,  said :_:  In politics ,_,  when you want to hang somebody ,_,  you accuse him of stealing money ._. 
But first the President should tell us who stole our N20 billion and they should ensure that all those who stole pension funds are arrested and prosecuted ._. Campaign funds are not public funds ._. 
It is a case of misplaced priority ._. 
It looks like the President is more concerned with campaign funds than with public funds ._. 
We had been told how many kilometres of road N20 billion can tar ,_,  let him punish those who are stealing public funds before talking about private campaign funds ._. 
The President's outburst is ridiculous ,_,  Oyegun insisted ._. On the continued violence in the North perpetrated by the Boko Haram sect ,_,  Oyegun said :_:  There is no way to describe what is going on in the name of Boko Haram in this country ._. 
The Muslims are supposed to be extreme Muslims ,_,  here they are kidnapping Muslim children ,_,  what part of their struggle for God can justify such a dastardly act ._. Secondly ,_,  how can those children be abducted and the kidnappers are not be apprehended by security forces How many pick up vans were required to transport them How was it that those who abducted the kids travelled to the schools ,_,  fired shots ,_,  and abducted them ,_,  yet we did not hear of any response from any of the security agenciesI wonder how safe we are in this country ._. 
I am really sad for this country ,_,  none of us is safe in this country ,_,  he said ._. 
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has held an emergency meeting with his top security officials ,_,  in the wake of a string of deadly attacks and the abduction of more than 100 schoolgirls ._. He also met with some of the state governors on Thursday in the capital ,_,  Abuja ._. 
The meeting did not include governors from the opposition All Progressive Congress party ,_,  although some represent regions hardest hit by the recent unrest ._. Despite the absences ,_,  Akwa Ibom state governor Godswill Akpabio told reporters that all Nigerians would have to work together to resolve the crisis ._. We must face the situation and it is not something that we should politicize ._. 
We cannot politicize security ._. 
All hands must be on deck ._. 
The entire country ._. 
Every single Nigerian must contribute his quota towards bringing the current situation to an end ,_,  said AkpabioHe said President Jonathan called a second meeting ,_,  for next Wednesday ,_,  that would include opposition party governors ._. 
Nigeria has been rocked by a series of attacks this week ,_,  including a Monday bombing in Abuja that left at least 75 people dead ._. Also Monday ,_,  unidentified gunmen attacked a secondary school in the northeastern Borno state region and kidnapped over 100 students ._. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the kidnappings ,_,  but the assault is similar to attacks that have been carried out by the Boko Haram Islamist militant group ._. On Wednesday ,_,  Nigeria's Joint Information Center said most of the abducted girls had been freed ,_,  but the school's principal denied the report ._. United Nations human rights representatives say they are extremely concerned about the kidnappings of the 12 -_:  to 17 -_: year -_: old girls ._. 
In a Thursday statement ,_,  the representatives said such attacks are prohibited under international law ._. 
Maiduguri � THE Borno State Government and Principal of Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  in Borno State ,_,  Mrs ._. 
Asabe Aliyu Kwarmbula have denied reports that most of the abducted girls have been rescued ._. Mrs ._. 
Kwarmbula particularly denied reports credited to her that she told the Military Spokesman ,_,  Defence Headquarters ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade that most of the girls abducted have been rescued ,_,  with only eight still missing ._. It will be recalled that the military spokesman in Abuja told newsmen that about 80 of the abducted school girls have been rescued on Wednesday ,_,  with only eight of them missing or are still captives of the terrorists ._. 
But Mrs ._. 
Asabe Kwarmbula in an interview with journalists ,_,  yesterday ,_,  said :_:  The statement credited to the military spokesman was a blatant lie ,_,  I never spoke to the Defence Headquarters' spokesman as widely reported by national and international media ._. Meanwhile ,_,  the Defence Headquarters ,_,  yesterday ,_,  retracted its statement that the girls had been rescued ,_,  saying that it depended on field reports which it had found out to be misleading ._. 
It ,_,  therefore ,_,  confirmed the statements of the school principal and Borno State Government that the girls were yet to be rescued ._. Also ,_,  yesterday ,_,  parents of the missing female students cried out to the authorities to rescue their children ._. I am disappointed  -_:  PrincipalI am highly disappointed by the spokesman of the Defence Headquarters who told the media that I confirmed to him that 80 of my students who were abducted by terrorists have been rescued ._. 
From the official record I have ,_,  only 14 out of the 129 missing have been rescued as at today Thursday ._. On whether there were security operatives guarding the school before the incident ,_,  which had claimed lives of a soldier and a policeman ,_,  she said ,_,  the security operatives only came during exam hours and left after the exams ,_,  pointing out that ,_,  when the gunmen struck ,_,  no security operative was guarding the school ._. Defence Headquarters ,_,  in a statement issued by its spokesman ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade on Wednesday claimed that only eight of the 129 abducted schoolgirls were missing as others had been rescued by the military ._. 
Major -_: General Olukolade also claimed that the principal of the affected school confirmed that only eight students were still being held by the terrorists ._. Following the announcement by the military ,_,  the parents trooped to the home of the area's tribal chief ,_,  yesterday ,_,  demanding clarification ,_,  saying they have not heard anything from their children ._. Where are our children ,_,  parents cry outA resident of Chibok ,_,  Lawan Zanna ,_,  whose daughter was among those abducted said :_:  For the military which is supposed to find and rescue our children to be spreading such lies shows that they have no intention of rescuing our girls ._. 
It is the highest form of insult ._. 
They said our girls have been freed ._. 
Bring them to us because they are yet to be reunited with us ._. The feeling that the military was in pursuit of the kidnappers kept hope alive among parents ,_,  said one resident ,_,  speaking on condition of anonymity ._. 
But the dubious report that most of the children were now safe has shattered that hope ,_,  he said ._. The affected parents ,_,  who were visibly angry and dejected have therefore mobilised themselves ,_,  insisting that they were prepared to sacrifice their lives and storm the Sambisa forest in search of their children ,_,  if the military would not be of help ._. A resident ,_,  who spoke to the BBC Hausa service monitored by our correspondent said :_: We were disappointed with the statement coming from the Defence Headquarters' spokesman that the girls were rescued ._. 
Our children were still in the bush and if the military has failed ,_,  we will go after the insurgents even if it means sacrificing our lives ._. The update by Borno GovtMeanwhile ,_,  Borno State Commissioner for Education ,_,  Musa Inuwa Kubo in a statement ,_,  yesterday ,_,  gave an update on the abduction of the students ._. He said in the statement :_:  I'm right at Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  the scene of the unfortunate abduction ._. 
At the moment ,_,  we have taken custody of 30 girls ._. 
There is an increase of 16 students whose parents returned to school after they ran home on the day of the attack ._. 
We had made announcements and called on parents whose children and wards ran home ._. 
The aim is for us to take proper account of our 129 students who were at the hostel on the day of that unfortunate attack ._. 
You may recall that 14 students had earlier escaped from captivity as explained by our Governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima on Wednesday ._. By our records of 129 students being at the hostel at the time of that unfortunate incident ,_,  we are expecting the return of about 99 students who might be among those said to have been rescued by the Military ._. 
My self ,_,  the principal of the school ,_,  parents ,_,  other students and residents are awaiting the return of our students ._. 
We have no reason to doubt or contradict Wednesday's announcement by the Defence Headquarters ,_,  given the fact that the Military personnel are those leading the search and rescue operations along with civilian volunteers ._. 
We are very hopeful that perhaps ,_,  the freed students are safely with the military and being brought to us ._. 
We pray that not just all our students return in good health but also all the security agents and volunteers safely return in good health after a successful and patriotic rescue effort ._. 
We call on parents to remain prayerful and hopeful that by the grace of God all the students will return to us in good health ._. 
On behalf of the Borno State Government ,_,  my ministry ,_,  staff and students of the affected school ,_,  parents and relations of affected students ,_,  I deeply appreciate the concern of all Nigerians and rest of the world for their solidarity and well wishes ._. I also thank the media for their very critical role as we look forward to overcoming this grieving experience ._. Three of the girls who escaped said they were taken to the Sambisa Forest part of Borno ,_,  an area where Boko Haram is known to have well -_: fortified camps ._. 
Boko Haram's latest school attack sparked outrage and condemnation from Britain ,_,  the United States and UN chief ,_,  Ban Ki -_: moon ._. 
Borno's governor Shettima voiced outrage at the violence targeting teenage girls ._. In Islam ,_,  women and children are spared during war ,_,  said a visibly shaken Shettima ._. Defence Headquarters retracts rescue reportMeanwhile ,_,  the Defence Headquarters ,_,  yesterday ,_,  disclosed that there was no need to play politics with the lives of the students of the Government Girls College ,_,  in Chibok ,_,  noting that as a result of the denial by principal and government of Borno State ,_,  it was retracting its statement on the rescue of the students ._. A statement signed by Major General Chris Olukolade said :_:  In the light of the denial by the principal of the school ,_,  the Defence Headquarters wishes to defer to the school principal and Governor's statement on the number of students still missing and retract that aspect of earlier statement while the search continues ._. The controversy that has been generated around the efforts at securing the lives of the abducted students of Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok is unfortunate ._. The ongoing frantic efforts of security forces along with vigilante groups including hunters working to locate and free the abducted students have continued to be keenly monitored at the Operation Centre of the Defence and Army Headquarters as regular progress reports are being received from troops on the ground ._. In this regard ,_,  a report was filed in from the field indicating that a major breakthrough had been recorded in the search ._. 
There was no reason to doubt this official channel; hence the information was released to the public immediately ._. Surprisingly ,_,  however ,_,  the school principal ,_,  one of the sources quoted in the report has denied all that was attributed to her for whatever reasons ._. 
This is an unfortunate development indeed ,_,  yet the Defence Headquarters would not want to join issues with anyone ._. It has to be reaffirmed ,_,  however ,_,  that the report forwarded to the public on this issue was in good faith and not intended to deceive the public as is being interpreted following the denials by the school principal and Government of Borno State ._. Like all other citizens ,_,  the military is deeply concerned to ensure that the students are safe and freed alive ._. There is indeed no reason to play politics with the precious lives of the students ._. 
The number of those still missing is not the issue now as the life of every Nigerian is very precious ._. 
Military authorities last night admitted that none of the abducted Borno schoolgirls had been rescued ,_,  a day after claiming that troops had freed all but 8 of the 129 students ._. The recant came hours after the principal of the Government Girls Secondary School Chibok spoke and denied the claims by the Defence Headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday evening ._. Following the principal's denial ,_,  the Borno State Education Commissioner said a total of 30 students had so far been located ,_,  leaving 99 still missing ._. The schoolgirls were taken from their hostel by suspected Boko Haram gunmen on Monday night ._. The school principal ,_,  Mrs Asabe Kwambura ,_,  told Daily Trust by telephone yesterday morning that other than the 14 students who escaped on the night of the attack ,_,  no more girls had been found ._. There is nothing in the military statement that is true about our abducted girls ._. 
Up till now we are still waiting and praying for the safe return of the students ,_,  she said ._. All I know is that we have only 14 of them ,_,  and the security people especially the vigilante and the well -_: meaning volunteers of Gwoza are still out searching for them ._. 
The military people too are in the bush searching ._. So we have not received any information that they have gotten the students yet ._. 
So let it be clear that all the information passed on the media by the military concerning 107 girls is not true ._. In a statement Wednesday evening ,_,  spokesman for the Defence Headquarters Major General Chris Olukolade said the principal had confirmed that only 8 of the abducted students remained to be found ._. But Mrs Kwambura said yesterday :_:  I ,_,  as the principal ,_,  did not tell anybody any figure on released students other than what our Governor ,_,  His Excellency Kashim Shettima ,_,  had informed the media ._. A military official called me from Abuja and I told him that I don't want to be seen to be contradicting myself on that because what the governor had said was what we know about ._. The GGSS Chibok principal spoke to Daily Trust in the morning ._. 
Later in the evening ,_,  Borno State Education Commissioner Musa Inuwa Kubo issued a separate statement saying 16 more missing students were found and the total of those yet to be seen stood at 99 ._. He said ,_,  At the moment we have taken custody of 30 girls ._. 
There is an increase of 16 students whose parents returned them to school after they ran home on the day of the attack ._. We had made announcements and called on parents whose children and wards ran to home ._. 
The aim is for us to take proper account of our 129 students who were at the hostel on the day of that unfortunate attack ._.

By our records of 129 students being at the hostel at the time of that unfortunate incident ,_,  we are expecting the return of about 99 students who might be among those said to have been rescued by the Military ._. DHQ backtracksLater last night ,_,  the Director of Defence Information Major -_: General Chris Olukolade issued a statement explaining the circumstances surrounding the controversy over the claimed rescue of abducted girls ._. He said ,_,  The ongoing frantic efforts of security forces along with vigilante groups including hunters working to locate and free the abducted students have continued to be keenly monitored at the Operation Centre of the Defence and Army Headquarters as regular progress reports are being received from troops on the ground ._.

There is indeed no reason to play politics with the precious lives of the students ._. 
The number of those still missing is not the issue now as the life of every Nigerian is very precious ._. In the light of the denial by the principal of the school ,_,  the Defence Headquarters wishes to defer to the school principal and Governor's statement on the number of students still missing and retract that aspect of earlier statement while the search continues ._. Parents head to B/Haram enclavesMeanwhile ,_,  parents of the teenage girls have joined the search efforts into the dreaded Sambisa Forest to try to find their daughters ._. One of the parents told the BBC Hausa radio that each of them contributed N13 ,_, 500 ,_,  which they gave to the local vigilantes ._. Male parents have gone into the Sambisa forest ,_,  because we are tired of what we are hearing from government ._. 
And then this morning we heard government is saying they rescued our daughters ._. 
That is why we said we would do the search ourselves ,_,  the man said ._. The pain is too much for us ._. 
As I am speaking to you now ,_,  I will join them in the bush as soon as I finish this interview ._. Security sources told Daily Trust yesterday that the abducted students were yet to be found because troops on rescue mission around the Sambisa Forest could not get deep into the bushes because of the difficult terrain ._. Military officers handling the rescue mission are also mapping out strategy to avoid being ambushed ,_,  a source said ._. Our correspondent gathered that hundreds of troops have been deployed from various fronts around Konduga ,_,  Bama and Damboa in central part of Borno State ,_,  as well as Gwoza and Chibok in the southern part in order to achieve coordinated onslaught with minimum risk ._. Other sources said the insurgents may be using the girls as human shield or war brides ,_,  stressing that it will require a lot of strategy to free the students without allowing them to be harmed by the insurgents or killed during confrontation ._. Calls for decisive actionAlhaji Ahmed Ashemi ,_,  the pioneer chairman of Peoples Democratic Party PDP in Borno State ,_,  said the Federal Government must organise special military task force that would also include collaboration with neighboring countries and local hunters to rescue the girls ._. The Boko Haram insurgents do not listen to plea and the fact is that they have reached the extreme ._. 
We must salvage the dignity of these girls before it is too late ._. 
Let Nigeria set aside its pride as the giant of Africa and seek assistance because from all indications ,_,  our security agencies need serious help ,_,  he said ._. Hajiya Falmata Usman ,_,  a mother of five ,_,  said those misleading Nigerians must be made to account for their actions ._. The President should also relocate to Borno immediately and see to the release of these girls ._. 
The insurgents are in Sambisa and not Cameroon ._. 
Don't we have satellite images Don't we have fighter jets Don't we have enough troops to cordon the whole of southern Borno and save these young girls She asked ._. Janet Abu ,_,  a student in Maiduguri ,_,  said they deserve an apology from Nigerian authorities ._. I doubt much if I would pass my final -_: year exams because my mind is with my abducted sisters ._. this is something that can also happen to me ._. 
If it is true that the girls have been freed ,_,  we want the military to show them on television; we want to hear their voices ,_,  she said ._. 
AFTER four weeks of plenary sessions the National Conference will dissolve into committee sessions next week Tuesday when they return from the Easter break ._. 
This was one of the decisions delegates took yesterday before adjourning ._. It came on day that the Chairman of the National Conference ,_,  Justice Idris Kutigi ,_,  said that they might ask for extension of time to enable them do justice to the gamut of issues before them ._. 
The conference was handed a three -_: month timeline upon inauguration last month and the delegates have used up one month already with much ground uncovered ._. The list of 20 Standing Committees and their chairmen ,_,  co -_: chairmen and deputy chairmen was announced on Wednesday and made available to all the delegates ._.

Also yesterday ,_,  before the adjournment ,_,  the Work Plan ,_,  a document stating the activities of the Conference and the time -_: frame attached to such activities ,_,  was adopted by delegates for implementation pending any alteration based on necessity ._. Work planAccording to the Work Plan ,_,  Committee work would begin on Tuesday ,_,  April 22 after the Easter break and end on Wednesday ,_,  April 30 ._. Speaking yesterday ,_,  Justice Kutigi informed the delegates that the National Judicial Institute and 10 meeting rooms at Sheraton Hotels and Towers will be used as venues by the committees ._. Kutigi ,_,  prior to motion for adjournment by former Governor of Akwa Ibom State and a delegate representing former governors ,_,  Obong Victor Attah ,_,  informed the house that the conference will also break  -_:  off for the World Economic Forum between May 7 -_: 9 ,_,  assured that the conference may request for extra days subject to the government approval when the need arises ._. Commends govts ,_,  security agencies over rescued studentsDelegates also agreed to commend the Federal Government ,_,  security agencies and the people of Borno State for rescuing a good number of the 100 female students of Government Girls Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State ,_,  who were abducted by insurgents ,_,  on Monday ._. Leading the debate at the plenary session under a matter of urgent national importance ,_,  a delegate representing the Civil Society Orgsnisation ,_,  Mr ._. 
Femi Falana SAN ,_,  who stressed the need for delegates to commend the Federal Government and security forces as well as members of the civilian Joint Task Force in Borno for securing the release of 129 of the girls kidnapped by suspected Boko Haram terrorists ,_,  said :_:  This morning we read that majority of the girls have been released ._. The armed forces and people of Borno State have rescued the children ._. 
I am urging this House to commend the efforts of the armed forces and the people of Borno in rescuing majority of these girls while calling for the intensification of efforts for the release of the remaining eight girls ._. Seconding the motion ,_,  a delegate representing the Elder statesmen category ,_,  Iyom Josephine Anenih ,_,  explained that progress made at rescuing the girls which was supported by the civilian JTF clearly justified calls for concerted efforts by the local leaders to help checkmate the insurgents ._. Delegates who spoke hailed the motion and it was agreed that the secretariat should convey their commendation to the Federal Government ._. Despite the resolution to commend the Federal Government some of the delegates still desired more action to ensure safety of lives and property ._. Restoring order in WukariIn her contribution ,_,  former Minister of Water Resources and a delegate representing Taraba State ,_,  Dr ._.  Mrs ._. 
Salome Jakanda ,_,  made an emotional appeal for the conference to ask the Federal Government to immediately deploy security forces to restore order in Wukari town ._. 
She told her colleagues that the town was currently besieged by invading terrorists ,_,  which has led to a 24 -_: hour curfew that has put enormous pressure on the social and economic live of the people ._. Jakanda said :_:  Right now Wukari is under siege and there is a 24 hour curfew in the place ._. 
People cannot come out from their house and they do not have food ._. 
It is an invasion that the people are experiencing now and the invaders came in their thousands and are killing and maiming innocent people ,_,  she said ._. Committee workDebates on insecurity over ,_,  attention of the delegates was shifted to the work of the committees ._. Contributing ,_,  a delegate from Sokoto State ,_,  Alhaji Muhammed Maigari Dingyadi ,_,  who faulted the committees' work plan ,_,  said that four days will not be enough for the plenary to fully discuss the reports of the 20 committees ._. For Abubakar Gigiwa ,_,  time for the secretariat to prepare its report should be reduced and added to the time for committees' work as that would give enough time for proper job to be done ,_,  adding that some adjustments on the committee composition be made in line with the complaints ._. Let's keep to time -_: frame  -_:  ABC NwosuIn his contribution ,_,  former Minister of Health and a delegate representing Anambra State ,_,  Prof ._.  ABC Nwosu ,_,  suggested that delegates should respect the time frame allocated for the conference and should not give the impression to the public that all they wanted was an extension of time for selfish reasons ._. He said that he would not subscribe to any request for the extension of time of the conference because such move would be misconstrued by members of the public that the delegates were seeking extension for pecuniary interest ._. He however urged delegates to work very hard within the limits of the time and deliver its report as scheduled ._. Saving the conference from a repeat of Wednesday's proceedings ,_,  Justice Kutigi had to call the conference to order and appealed to delegates to go for the committee work first and that the issue of time frame can be handled when the need arises ._. He added that the work plan for the conference was prepared and given to the secretariat at the commencement of sitting and urged that efforts should be made to stick to it ._.

An apparently embarrassed Nigerian military on Thursday backtracked on its claim that it freed majority of the 129 female students of the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  Borno State ,_,  abducted on Monday night by suspected Boko Haram members ._. The spokesperson of the Defence Headquarters ,_,  DHQ ,_,  Chris Olukolade ,_,  had said 107 of the girls were freed in addiction to the 14 that escaped from their abductors ._. Mr ._.

Kwambura's claim portrayed the military in bad light and angered several Nigerians ,_,  with some accusing the military and the Nigerian government of playing politics with the lives of the abducted girls ._. Apparently terribly rattled by the denial of its claim ,_,  the military on Thursday night issued a statement ,_,  saying it was deferring to the principal of the school and the Borno government on the correct number of girls that have so far been freed ._.

Jos ,_,  though still commercially vibrant and more populated ,_,  is different from that serene place of my youthful days ._. Jos in the colonial days had its own apartheid with Europeans predominating; there was the European Hospital ,_,  European dwelling areas ,_,  European Club ._. 
There were also the Clerks' Quarters for Southern Civil Servants and also ,_,  the Native Area dominated by Northerners and Southerners of lower ranks ._. The problems of today could be traced to the total neglect of the indigenes of Jos who had no access to education or any type of social services ._. 
They were not considered part of the emerging Jos metropolis of the decades before the 1950s ._. The present problem of Jos could be traced to the rise in political fortunes of the indigenes ,_,  especially after the creation of Plateau State ._. 
The indigenes could not afford to see the capital of their state being dominated politically and economically by 'foreigners'  -_:  Hausa/Fulani and Southerners ._. 
Even the Jos North Local Government Council ,_,  heavily dominated by 'foreigners' had to be forced to accept an indigene as its chairman against democratic principle ._. The indigenes seem to be in a hurry to redress the heinous crimes mistakes of the past ._. 
The unsolved problem of Jos and Plateau State is how to resolve the legitimate political rights of the indigenes and the democratic rights of those described as 'foreigners' who are great contributors to the economy ,_,  and have resided there for a very long time ._. The example of Jos is a salient reminder of the crucial problems between indigenes and others in many parts of the country today ._. It may be asked what rights Nigerians have in places of their domicile outside the areas of their birth ._. 
In those my pal days ,_,  it was possible for non indigenes to enjoy full political rights without any discrimination ._. 
In the 1930s ,_,  Lagos had an Ijaw Ernest Ikoli as the Member of the Legislative Council and Dr ._.  Azikiwe represented Lagos in the old Legislative Council in 1947 and Western House of Assembly in 1951 ._. 
Mazi Mbonu Ojike was a popular Deputy Mayor of Lagos in the 1950s ._. 
In Enugu ,_,  Mallam Umaru Altine was once elected as the Mayor ._. In the North ,_,  many Southerners enjoyed free scholarships in secondary schools ._. 
But these were good old days before the creation of states and the present 36 states' structure ._. 
It is admirable that Lagos State maintains a dignified liberal stance in the provision and distribution of social services and amenities ._. In some parts of the country ,_,  especially the Northern and Southern parts ,_,  non -_: indigenes foreigners are settled in various designated areas Sabongari where social services are not well provided and democratic rights often restricted ._. 
Many of these designated areas are often over -_: crowded and disease -_: ridden ._. Perhaps ,_,  the most embarrassing phase of Nigeria's development is the co -_: existence of the rich and the poor within the same environment ._. 
Often ,_,  the rich could afford the necessary gadgets of modern life while the poor found it difficult to live well ._. 
Many times ,_,  such noticeable incompatibility in the standards of living had been a cause of envy and its disastrous consequences of stealing ,_,  arson and community riots ._. The changing phases of Nigeria have brought many political and economic challenges that have risen over the years ._. 
The problems arising from ethnic and religious matters ,_,  especially in some Northern parts where churches had been burnt and worshippers brutally killed are rampant ._. Also ,_,  in many parts of the country ,_,  boundary disputes ,_,  especially in the South ,_,  had caused destruction of villages and forceful displacement of people ._. 
Many people believe ,_,  and justifiably so ,_,  that the deficient structure of the country as regards to states created could be responsible ._. It is generally recognized that the vast development of the country in many phases has not been matched by the increase in latent ability to solve the emerging problems ._. 
The official reaction to any untoward event is to set up a committee of enquiry ,_,  the report of which is cleverly kept in a secret locker ._. Since perpetrators of evil deeds are not afraid of immediate reprisal and they would continue in their wanton destruction of life and property ._. 
It is often suggested that an official proactive hard stance against immunity of the few bad citizens would go a long way in solving many problems ._. The most terrible aspect of Nigerian development is the growth of insurgency arising from religious intolerance which has not been properly confronted ._. 
There is another aspect to insurgency which points to poverty caused by mass unemployment ._. 
It appears that the daring exploits of the Boko Haram murderous gang is quite beyond the widest imagination of simple religious fanatics  -_:  there are signs of expertise ._. We may be looking towards the rank of unemployed graduates ,_,  dismissed police and army officers and educated political thugs ._. The new phase of the country's development appears to be based on violent insurgency ,_,  political instability ,_,  unemployment ,_,  armed robbery ,_,  kidnapping and ritual and political killings ._. The mood of today is the call for a radical change to meet a more serious challenge to the continuous existence of the country ._. 
The country needs at the moment statesmen ,_,  not crafty politicians; wise people ,_,  and not shallow thinkers; a coalition of parties ,_,  and not a spineless single party ._. The other day ,_,  there was a destructive bomb blast at Nyanya ,_,  Abuja the capital city ._. 
That event was followed by the abduction of 200 girls from a college in Borno State  -_:  a state under the state of Emergency ._. From those halcyon years of principled politics ,_,  ethnic harmony and religious understanding ,_,  times have changed for worse ,_,  leaving in their trails ,_,  vestiges of bitterness and surges of violence ._. 
This is not the time for politics but consensus in the country ._. 
It is not a time to welcome political defectors but the right time to deny the nation against the common foe  -_:  insurgency in the North East ._. 
Onitsha � Tears are now flowing freely from the eyes of the victims of last Saturday's fire disaster that destroyed goods estimated at over N1 billion at the food stuff section of Ose -_: Ekwodu market ,_,  Onitsha ,_,  Anambra State ._. The losses which were earlier estimated at about N100 million by the market officials when the incident was still fresh ,_,  have now been properly evaluated at over N1 billion by the victims themselves ._. Some of the goods destroyed by the inferno included tailoring materials ,_,  bags of rice ,_,  salt and brooms ,_,  onions and baskets ,_,  clothing materials ,_,  cosmetics ,_,  rolls of ropes ,_,  crates of soft drinks ,_,  cartons of beer ,_,  drums of local gin ,_,  tubers of yam ,_,  mirror ,_,  foam ,_,  palm oil ,_,  provisions ,_,  kerosine ,_,  cash ,_,  jewelries ,_,  among others ._. For Mrs ._. 
Ndidi Okonkwo ,_,  a widow and mother of three whose two shops ,_,  stocked with bags of rice ,_,  were razed completely ._. 
I am now living a miserable life and I don't know where to start from ._. Also for Madam Justina Eze ,_,  whose rolls of ropes ,_,  many quantities of umbrella ,_,  palm oil ,_,  provisions ,_,  soft drinks and local gin which she estimated at N1 ._. 5 million were lost to the fire :_:  My only hope is on the state government to come to our rescue ._. Reacting to the development ,_,  the traditional ruler of Ifite Anam and chairman of Anambra West Local Government Traditional Rulers' Council ,_,  HRM ,_,  Igwe Sylvester Nnose whose wives and sisters were affected by the inferno ,_,  called on the state government to take urgent steps in rescuing the victims before they give up hopes ._. Other victims who are equally counting their losses included the chairlady of the burnt line ,_,  Victoria Okoye and Papa Imo ,_,  chairman of Oguta line ._. Governor Willie Obiano who paid a sympathy visit to the burnt market on Monday ,_,  consoled them and promised to rebuild the market for the victims ,_,  even though he did not mention a specific period to commence the rebuilding work ._. The Chairman of Ose -_: Ekwodu Market ,_,  Sunday Ewulu ,_,  disclosed that a fast food dealer residing within the market premises was arrested by the vigilance group attached to the market and handed over to the police on the suspicion that the fire outbreak started from his residence ._. Ewulu who noted that five suspects were initially arrested ,_,  said it was after a thorough screening by the vigilance group and the police that four others were released ,_,  while the actual suspect who disclosed on interrogation that he forgot to put off his stove before going out ,_,  is still with the police ._. Ewulu who admitted that some vigilante operatives attached to the market were able to secure some goods ,_,  also called on the state government ,_,  public spirited individuals and groups to come to the rescue of the traders whose source of livelihood have been terminated by the inferno ._. Also speaking ,_,  the President of Anambra Markets Amalgamated Traders Association ,_,  AMATAS ,_,  Chief Okwudili Ezenwankwo who also visited the market ,_,  expressed sympathy for the victims and specifically called on Governor Obiano to assist the victims in terms of rebuilding the shops for the traders and giving them funds to return to their businesses ._. Ezenwankwo also called on the state government to provide fire -_: fighting equipment in all the markets to forestall future occurence ,_,  adding that government should set up a panel of inquiry to investigate the cause of the incident ._. He disclosed that AMATAS would soon commence an enlightenment campaign on the need for the traders to take up insurance policies so that in the event of such an incident ,_,  the victims would be compensated by insurance companies ._. In far away Nnewi ,_,  the industrial town of Anambra State ,_,  another fire disaster was equally recorded at the multi -_: million naira Umuisiedo Market ,_,  Okpuno Egbu ,_,  Nnewi on the same Saturday night ._. 
Goods estimated at N50 million were said to have perished in the inferno ._. Eye -_: witnesses said that the Ose -_: Ekwodu in Onitsha fire incident occurred at about 3 ._. 30 a ._. m ._.  ,_,  while the Nnewi disaster occurred at about 2 ._. 30 a ._. m ._. Likewise ,_,  the Onitsha fire outbreak was brought under control by men of the state fire service from both the nearby Onitsha main market and Okpoko after all the goods had been burnt ,_,  while the Nnewi inferno was brought under control by sympathisers ._. At the scene of the Onitsha incident located at the bank of the River Niger ,_,  known by the traders as Zone 3 ,_,  Marine Road ,_,  Ose Ekwodu ,_,  the debris and burnt remains of the affected goods ,_,  including roasted yams and burnt pieces of zink and planks ,_,  were seen littering the ground ._. On the Nnewi fire incident ,_,  eyewitnesses stated that one of the shop owners ,_,  a pregnant woman ,_,  attempted to jump into the raging fire as the inferno destroyed all her goods ._. 
She was prevented from doing so through the prompt intervention of some sympathisers ._. The inferno was said to have already burnt down eleven shops fully stocked with various kinds of groceries to ashes before the intervention by passersby ._. 
The traders alleged that fire fighters in Nnewi could not respond to their distress call until the Okpoko fire service station ,_,  near Onitsha ,_,  came to their rescue when great damage had been done ._. It was gathered that while sympathisers were busy trying to secure the goods ,_,  some street urchins in Nnewi were said to have been busy looting the traders' goods in the ensuing confusion ._. One of the burnt Nnewi shop owners whose goods were all consumed by the fire ,_,  Mrs Adinu Mercy ,_,  said she was a returnee who fled from Kano State with her family due to incessant attacks by Boko Haram insurgents ._. The pregnant shop owner who wanted to jump into the fire was heard shouting :_:  How can I repay the loan I took in opening this shopFor Mr Chikwendu Nnadi ,_,  another victim ,_,  all hopes have been lost ._. 
Where will I start from where will I end ._. 
In fact ,_,  as I am talking to you now ,_,  I'm confused and I don't know what to do ._. Chairman of the market  ,_,  Chief Gilbert Eriobuna and chairman of Okpuno Egbu Security Organisation ,_,  Chief Amobi Nnoruka ,_,  expressed shock at the incident and pledged to investigate the cause of the inferno ._. 
Although the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs NSCIA is representing Muslims' interest at the conference ,_,  as affirmed by Prof ._.  Dawud Noibi ,_,  the Executive Secretary ,_,  Muslim Ummah of Southwest Nigeria MUSWEN; Facing the Kaaba provides this platform for Muslim individuals who do not have the opportunity to be at the conference to express their views on issues affecting Islam in the country ._. 
As the delegates settle for business at the conference ,_,  some Muslims have reminded their delegates to consider the issue of undue discrimination against the use of hijab ,_,  marriageable age and Sharia as critical for discussion at the confab ._. 
Others suggests that restrictions in some areas especially in the South west by the traditionalists through 'oro' masqurades should be discussed ._. Unity of the Ummah is important  -_:  Prof ._.  BalogunProfessor Kamaldeen Balogun ,_,  a lecturer at the Olabisi Onabanjo University ,_,  department of Religious Studies said the presence of Muslim representatives should be for the unity of the country ,_,  adding that whatever decision reached should be for the unity of the Ummah and the country in general ._. The Muslim representatives at the national conference have their agenda ._. 
It is not in our power to decide or dictate what they should discuss since they are there by the grace of Allah for our own good ._. But be that as it may ,_,  they should try and contribute meaningfully to the confab and ensure that all decisions reached are in the best interest of Islam ._. This is because one cannot deny the fact that Nigeria is a multi -_: religious country even though we claim to be a secular state ._. 
Every religion should be allowed to practice their faith without hindrance or any form of persecution ._. 
The unity of the country however ,_,  should not be compromised ._. There should be freedom of worship  -_:  Imam YusufDr ._. 
Tajudeen Yusuf ,_,  a lecturer at Department of Insurance ,_,  University of Lagos ,_,  Akoka opined that Muslim delegates should fight for legislation against contemptuous treatment of Muslims in the country ._. I want our representatives at the on going confab to fight for a legislation that will stop the treatment Muslims as second class citizen ._. 
There should be freedom of worship in all ramifications ._. 
Muslims should be allowed to dress ,_,  greet and worship in a way that conforms with the religion ._. At times ,_,  when we have outdoor programmes and some non Muslims see us sitting on the mat or when we segregate where brothers sit from that of the sisters ,_,  they see us as uncivilised group of people ._. 
This is not fair in our own father -_: land ,_,  he said ._. Our leaders must be fair and just  -_:  MaroofAdebesin Moroof ,_,  a civil servant in Abeokuta ,_,  Ogun state said Muslim delegates should emphasise on equality of Muslims with their counterparts in all socio -_: political endeavours adding that the loapsidedness in arrangment of state affairs and appointments are some of the injustices in the country ._. It is our prayer that Muslim delegates at the confab will try to ensure that the spiritual strength in them will keep them sailing through ._. 
I want them to emphasise on equality ._. They should condemn the murder of all Christians in the north by Boko Haram ,_,  not because they are Christians ,_,  but because they are human beings  -_:  creatures of God ._. As Muslim delegates ,_,  they should come against the exploitation of religion and religious sentiments ._. 
The delegates should work towards suggesting laws that will stop stereotype ,_,  stigmatization and dehumanization of one another ._. I disagree with the use of religion as a political decoy and as a distraction from the critical things that bedevile our nation ,_,  he said ._. 
Some parents and relatives of the abducted students of the Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok ,_,  have raised the alarm over the continued stay of the girls with their abductors ,_,  suspected to be members of the Boko Haram ._. According to the parents ,_,  the lives of the girls may be ruined if they are not rescued before they are serially violated by their captors ._. An aunt of one of the abducted students ,_,  identified as Dorcas ,_,  told LEADERSHIP Friday that the entire community was traumatized by the abduction of the schoolgirls ._. She said ,_,  My niece ,_,  Dorcas ,_,  was not lucky to be among the few girls who reportedly escaped from the hands of their abductors ._. 
Her father and all of us in the family have not slept since the incident ._. 
None of us knows what to believe concerning the fate of the girls ._. Another resident of the community and a mother three ,_,  Sarah ,_,  said the 121 girls that the military claimed to have rescued are not our girls ,_,  because we have only seen 16 girls out of the abducted students ._. 
We have not seen the girls as claimed by the military ._. In the first place ,_,  it was our people that initiated the rescue mission before the military later joined ._. 
But in all of the rescue efforts ,_,  such number of girls was never found ._. Another resident of Chibok village ,_,  who pleaded anonymity ,_,  said two of her nieces of the same parents were among the missing girls ._. She said ,_,  As I talk to you now ,_,  the mother of these girls is traumatised and in a terrible state of mind ._. 
The government should stop this propaganda about rescuing the girls ._. 
If they have rescued them as they claim ,_,  they should return them to their parents ,_,  who are obviously going through difficult times ._. Parents ,_,  relatives of abducted schoolgirls lament their ordealAnother parent ,_,  Mrs Lydia Ibrahim ,_,  said that it was very difficult getting some of the mothers to speak about their plights ,_,  but Chibok resident ,_,  Ibrahim ,_,  whose three cousins were amongst those abducted and taken away ,_,  said they still nurse the hope the girls will be brought back safely ._. We have been looking for them since the time we heard of the incident but there is no information ._. 
So ,_,  when we heard the military saying they had found them ,_,  we had to rush down to the school but found no one; it is over 24 hours now ,_,  yet we have not seen them ._. 
We don't know what is happening because the news of their rescue by the military had really gladdened our minds ._. 
But now we are left in confusion ._. 
These girls are innocent ._. 
We plead that government should do all that it can to help us out ,_,  Mrs Ibrahim ._. A man who simply identified himself as Mallam Amos told LEADERSHIP Friday in Hausa that his daughter was among the girls taken away ._. I understand some of the girls were able to escape ,_,  but she is a tender girl ,_,  and I know she may not be able to summon that courage and escape ._. 
Her mother has fainted twice due to the trauma and fear of possibly losing her last daughter ,_,  he said ._. The district head of Chibok ,_,  who prefers not to be quoted using his names ,_,  said there had been a general sadness amongst the parents of the missing girls ,_,  especially as the military made a false claim that the girls had been rescued ._. We are now taking our destiny into our hands  -_:  all of us ._. 
Every male person that is an adult has volunteered to go into the bushes and search for our daughters since the military people are saying that they have rescued our daughter while they are nowhere near home ,_,  he said ._. Chibok elders refute military claim over release of studentsChibok elders of Borno State have faulted the claim of the Nigerian military saying that only eight out of over 100 students abducted in the state are yet to be freed ._. The national chairman of Kibaku Area Development Association KADA ,_,  Dr Pogu Bitrus ,_,  told journalists in Abuja yesterday that the military statement was false as he insisted that the families of the abducted students and the school authority are yet to receive their children ._. DHQ keeps mumAll attempts made to hear the side of the Defence Headquarters on the controversy surrounding the purported rescue of the female students did not yield result ._. Several calls made to the director of information ,_,  Major General Chris Olukolade ,_,  proved abortive as his phone was switched off ._. 
He was said to have gone for a special meeting ._. The officer our reporter contacted over the issue insisted that he was not competent to speak on the matter ._. Controversy trails alleged release of abducted Borno schoolgirlsBarely 48 hours Brigadier -_: General Chris Olukolade disclosed that 121 out of 129 female students who were abducted from Government Girls Secondary School GGSS ,_,  Chibok ,_,  by members of Boko Haram had been freed by a combined effort of Civilian -_: Joint Task Force C -_: JTF and the Military Joint Task Force JTF ,_,  Borno State governor Kashim Shettima and the principal of the school ,_,  Mrs Asabe Kwambura ,_,  have faulted the claim ._. Olukolade had on Wednesday claimed the 121 of the kidnapped SSS -_: 3 girls had been freed and that only eight were still in captivity ._. But the Principal of G ._. G ._. S ._. S ._. 
Chibok ,_,  Mrs Asabe Kwambura ,_,  who Olukolade said had given him the information yesterday ,_,  denied ever giving him such figure ,_,  insisting that she stood by the 14 girls that Shettima announced as having been released ._. Mrs Kwambura who spoke to journalists in Maiduguri said :_:  There is nothing in the military statement that is true about our abducted girls; up until now ,_,  we are still waiting and praying for the safe return of the students ._. 
All I know is that we have only 14 of them ,_,  and the security people ,_,  especially the vigilante and the well -_: meaning volunteers of Gwoza ,_,  are still out searching for them ._. 
The military people ,_,  too ,_,  are in the bush searching ._. 
So we have not received any information that they have got the students yet ._. So ,_,  let it be clear that all the information passed on the media by the military concerning 107 girls is not true ._. 
I ,_,  as the principal ,_,  did not tell anybody any figure on released students other than what our governor ,_,  His Excellency ,_,  Kashim Shettima ,_,  had informed the media ._. They contacted me from the army headquarters in Abuja ,_,  the principal went on ,_,  and I told them that I don't want to be seen to be contradicting myself on that because what the governor had said was what we know about; and I told them there may be additional rescue of the girls ,_,  but until this moment we have not received any of them apart from what we had before ._. 
What the governor said is still the true picture of the whole issue and that information given by the military is totally wrong ._. Governor Shettima had said ,_,  while announcing N50 million reward for information on the whereabouts of the girls ,_,  that only 14 girls had been recovered so far ._. Kashim said this while speaking in an interview aired on the Hausa Service of the BBC yesterday morning ._. We have recovered 14 of the girls and we have announced a N50 million reward for any credible information that will help us get our girls released and re -_: joined with their families ,_,  he had said ._. Many residents of Maiduguri were angered by this sad development as they asserted that this false claim had laid bare the truth about how the military may have been feeding the nation with false claims on victories of their troops over the Boko Haram insurgents ._. For God's sake ,_,  how can we continue like this How could a whole military lie about what is verifiable These girls are human beings ,_,  with flesh and blood and have come from homes and parents who are presently lamenting their missing wards ._. 
For one to come out and say they have been found when in actual fact the girls are still missing is ,_,  to me ,_,  the height of irresponsibility in public service ,_,  said a Borno permanent secretary who craved anonymity ._. Northern governors call emergency meetingFollowing increased and sustained killings going on some parts of the north ,_,  the Northern States Governors' Forum NSGF is to hold an emergency meeting next Tuesday ,_,  April 22 ,_,  2014 ._. In a statement signed by secretary to the Niger State government and coordinating chairman ,_,  Forum of Secretaries to the Government of Northern States ,_,  Hon ._. 
Saidu Ndako Idris Kpaki ,_,  said the meeting would hold at the Niger State Governor's Lodge ,_,  Jose Marti Crescent ,_,  Asokoro ,_,  Abuja ,_,  at 4pm ._. The statement posited that the meeting was called out of concern to address the incessant attacks and systematic killings of innocent people going on in the region which has become a source of embarrassment and great concern to the Forum ._. According to him ,_,  the meeting will discuss the increasing incidences of clashes between Fulani herdsmen and local communities as well as reckless massacre and kidnapping of people across the northern states ._. Bomb Threat :_:  NSCDC arrest man in KadunaThe Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps NSCDC ,_,  Kaduna State Command ,_,  has arrested one Mathias Odeh for threatening to bomb the national headquarters of the corps in Abuja ._. Odeh ,_,  34 ,_,  was picked up at his residence located at the Federal Housing Estate ,_,  Goni -_: Gora ,_,  Kaduna ,_,  on April 14 ,_,  2014 ,_,  following a privileged piece of information ._. Speaking on the arrest ,_,  Kaduna State Commandant of NSCDC ,_,  Alhaji Zakari Ibrahim Ningi said operatives of the NSCDC from Kaduna command swung into action immediately following report from the national headquarters of the bomb threat sent to the handset of a very senior officer ._. 
The operation was successful because the suspect has been apprehended and is giving us useful information ._. Upon interrogation ,_,  the suspect ,_,  Odeh ,_,  admitted he sent the bomb threat message claiming that he acted out of frustration following his sack from the corps when he least expected it ._. The suspect said he was dismissed from the NSCDC in 2013 over his involvement in bribery and theft of crude oil in Bayelsa State where he was serving at the time ._. He revealed that in order to conceal his identity and avoid being traced ,_,  he sent the threat message using the handset of his neighbour without her consent ._. He further revealed that his disengagement was linked to the 22 drums of diesel that were siphoned from impounded trucks parked at the JTF Base in Yenogoa ._. According to him ,_,  he served in the JTF for six years from 2006 -_:  2012 before his sack in 2013 ._. In another development ,_,  the corps said it has arrested another suspect who gave his name as Felix Peter for parading himself as a civil defence officer and defrauding desperate applicants of their money ._. Peter was arrested at Zangon -_: Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State on April 7 ,_,  2014 ,_,  and has revealed that so far he has made over N2million from the fraudulent transactions ._. Further ,_,  the suspect who is an undergraduate of the University of Jos claimed that he had an accomplices who are at large ._.

Senators urge FG ,_,  WAEC to extend examsA group of senators have appealed to the federal government and the West African Examination Council WAEC to extend the period of the examination in order to accommodate the abducted students of Government Girls College ,_,  Chibok when they regain their freedom ._. LEADERSHIP Friday recalls that female students ,_,  Borno State who were in school for the ongoing Senior Secondary School Examination were abducted by gunmenThey added that alternative arrangements should be made for the students by both the federal government and WAEC for them to write their final papers elsewhere outside the state ,_,  especially ,_,  the Federal Capital Territory ._. Spokesperson of the group of lawmakers ,_,  Senator Magnus Abe ,_,  in a chat with Senate correspondents ,_,  said government must not allow the Boko Haram sect to record cheap victory by truncating the girls' dream of acquiring education ._. Students in N/East should stay at home -_:  house leaderMajority Leader of the House of Representatives ,_,  Hon Mulikat Adeola -_: Akande PDP ,_,  Oyo has stated that schools in the north -_: east should be shut down pending when insurgency in the region is addressed by security agencies ._. The lawmaker said this while reacting to the Monday kidnap of over 100 female secondary school students in Borno State ._. I commend security agents for promptly coming to the rescue of the abducted girls in Borno ._. 
Some of them have been rescued and we pray that the remaining ones would also be found soon ._. 
However ,_,  I am of the opinion that schools in those areas be shut down until we are able to quell the insurgents ,_,  she said ._. Mulikat made this disclosure while speaking with journalists after she led female members of the House of Representatives to the National Hospital to sympathise with survivors of Nyanya bomb blast which occurred in Abuja on Monday morning ._. Condemning the terrorist attack ,_,  the House Leader urged Nigerians to cooperate and unify against insurgency by sharing information with security agents about suspicious movements ._. While going round the wards ,_,  the female lawmakers also offered prayers and cash donations individually to some of the victims after listening to their ordeal ._. 
Ex -_: militant leader ,_,  Preye Ekpebide ,_,  has warned Boko Haram insurgents to limit their operations to the North -_: East part of the country ,_,  as they were not welcomed to the Niger Delta ,_,  so as not to provoke the wrath of the former fighters ._. Ekpebide said that the ex -_: militants had watched with dismay and were keenly strategising to ensure that the bombings and killings taking place in the North do not happen in the South -_: South ._. He spoke in Bomadi ,_,  Delta State ,_,  while reacting to Monday's Abuja motor park bombing ,_,  which claimed over 70 lives ._. 
He called on President Goodluck Jonathan to apply maximum force and declare war on the Islamic sect ._. He noted that to stamp out the Boko Haram sect from Abuja and the three North -_: eastern states ,_,  the Federal Government needs to fight them from their root in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa ,_,  before it escalates to a national calamity ._. 
National Conference delegates Thursday unanimously resolved to commend the gallant efforts of Federal Government ,_,  security agencies and the people of Borno state for rescuing a good number of the girls abducted by insurgents ._. After a short deliberation on the conference work plan ,_,  delegates agreed to dissolve into committees from Tuesday ,_,  brushing aside request for extension of time ._. 
Leading the debate at the plenary session Thursday ,_,  prominent Lagos Lawyer ,_,  Mr ._. 
Femi Falana urged that Federal Government and security forces be commended along with the galant members of the civilian Joint Task Force in Borno for securing the release of 129 of the girls kidnapped last Monday by suspected Boko Haram terrorists ._. Speaking under a matter of urgent national importance ,_,  Falana said ,_,  This morning we read that majority of the girls have been released ._. 
The armed forces and people of Borno state have rescued the children ._. 
I am urging this house to commend the efforts of the armed forces and the people of Borno in rescuing majority of these while we are calling for the intensification of efforts for the release of the remaining eight girls ._. 
The military has been accused of lying over the fate of 107 schoolgirls who were abducted Monday night from their hostel at the Government Girls' Secondary School ,_,  Chibok in Borno State by Boko Haram terrorists ._. The school principal and state government sources confirmed to THISDAY that they were at a loss as to where the girls the military claimed they had freed from their abductor on Wednesday were ._. A state government official said as far as they were concerned ,_,  only 14 of the girls who managed to escape from their abductors were returned to the secondary school and have been reunited with their parents ._. Other parents and the principal of the college ,_,  he said ,_,  have been waiting anxiously for the other girls claimed to have been freed by the military ,_,  but had not been brought back to the school ._. He said it would be very unfortunate if the military was lying as something as sensitive as the whereabouts of over 100 missing girls ,_,  adding :_:  This is something that cannot be hidden and will be very shameful ._. 
Governors on the platform of All Progressives Congress APC ,_,  Thursday ,_,  shunned the security meeting convened by President Goodluck Jonathan ._.

In a statement he personally signed in Kaduna on Thursday Buhari said :_:  I cannot sit back and allow my image ,_,  and that of my political party be smeared by falsehood in the name of politics ._. 
He said the widely publicized and very serious allegations made against him by the PDP and its spokesman ,_,  Olisa Metuh ,_,  to the effect that his utterances were responsible for the current state of insecurity and terrorism bedeviling Nigeria ,_,  were absolutely without basis To support his claim ,_,  Mr ._. 
Metuh engaged in twisted logic and outright distortion  -_:  which he called facts  -_:  in which he said that I ,_,  Gen ._. 
Muhammadu Buhari ,_,  beckoned on my 'supporters to go on lynching spree' should I lose the 2011 presidential election ,_,  as a result of which 'an unprecedented violence broke out claiming the lives of hundreds of innocent people ._. 
An expanded security meeting to dwell on the worsening insecurity across Nigeria was held on Wednesday in the absence of 16 of Nigeria's 36 state governors ._. The absentees ,_,  all members of the opposition All Progressives Congress ,_,  APC ,_,  were not invited to the meeting ,_,  the Akwa Ibom State Governor ,_,  Godswill Akpabio ,_,  who was asked to brief journalists after the meeting ,_,  said ._. No ,_,  No ,_,  No; they APC governors were not invited ,_,  Mr ._. 
Akpabio ,_,  a member of Mr ._. 
Jonathan's ruling Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  told journalists ._. Despite the fact that three of the states mostly affected by the Boko Haram insurgency and thus under emergency rule  -_:  Adamawa ,_,  Borno ,_,  and Yobe  -_:  are controlled by APC governors ,_,  and that Mr ._. 
Jonathan had blamed the APC governors for the insurgency in their states ,_,  Mr ._. 
Akpabio tried to justify the reason why the opposition governors were not invited to the meeting ._. You know there was an initial requisition of this meeting by the PDP governors ,_,  this was as a fallout of our own meeting ._. 
And so it wasn't something that was extended to all ,_,  he said ._. That is why I said they have been invited on Wednesday ,_,  the Akwa Ibom governor added ,_,  saying the opposition governors have now been invited to an enlarged meeting on April 23 where all the governors ,_,  security chiefs ,_,  and the president will be present ._. He said Thursday's meeting was initiated by the PDP governors ,_,  whose forum he heads ,_,  to give the president and the service chiefs their views on the security challenge ._. Mr ._. 
Akpabio stated that Mr ._. 
Jonathan ,_,  however ,_,  decided that since the security challenge was a national one ,_,  all the 36 governors should be in attendance ._. We just wanted to meet with our president and some service chiefs to hear our views and also make some suggestions ._. 
Now he the president is insisting ,_,  which is right too ,_,  that is a national issue because it must be handled nationally and that is why all the governors must be here ._. Misinforming NigeriansMr ._. 
Akpabio's claim contradicts a Wednesday statement by presidential spokesperson ,_,  Reuben Abati ,_,  that all the state governors were invited for Thursday's enlarged meeting of the National Security Council ._. The statement said the enlarged meeting would be held hours after the main National Security Council meeting ._. 
The enlarged meeting would review the security situation in Nigeria as well as the ongoing national security measures and operations with a view to determining the best way forward ,_,  Mr ._. 
Abati said ._. The meeting of the National Security Council will be followed at 1300 Hours by an enlarged meeting on security developments in the country to which President Jonathan has invited state governors ,_,  Mr ._. 
Abati said ._. The spokesperson did not mention that only selected governors would be invited to the meeting ._. In what appears a ploy to mislead Nigerians ,_,  while Mr ._. 
Akpabio was justifying the deliberate non -_: invitation of the opposition governors ,_,  a presidential aide ,_,  Reno Omokri ,_,  was telling Nigerians that the APC governors boycotted the meeting ._. APC governors don't shun meetings where the Federal Government gives state funds ._. 
But as this one is to take care of the security of Nigerians ,_,  they shunned it ,_,  Mr ._. 
Omokri ,_,  President Jonathan's assistant on New Media ,_,  said on his twitter handle ._. Government is different from politics ._. 
It's quite unfortunate that in the pursuance of politics ,_,  APC governors shunned a meeting to secure the nation ,_,  Mr ._. 
Omokri added ._. It is not clear who among Mr ._. 
Akpabio and Mr ._. 
Omokri was lying ,_,  although Mr ._. 
Akpabio was at the meeting and spoke on behalf of the attendees ._. Politicising insecurityWhile Mr ._. 
Akpabio painted a picture of the meeting being a 'PDP' meeting ,_,  at least two non -_: PDP governors were at the meeting ._. Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra a member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance ,_,  APGA ,_,  and Governor Olusegun Mimiko of Ondo Labour Party attended ._. 
Both men ,_,  as well as their parties ,_,  are known loyalists of President Jonathan ._. PREMIUM TIMES learnt from a reliable source that the APC governors were initially invited for the meeting ._. We were invited ._. 
That is why all the APC governors were in Abuja on Tuesday ,_,  an aide to one of the APC governor's told PREMIUM TIMES ._. While in Abuja on Tuesday ,_,  the APC governors had visited victims of the Nyanya bomb blast in various hospitals ._. But on Tuesday evening ,_,  after the APC governors' meeting ,_,  the presidency reached out to us to say the meeting had been postponed ,_,  the aide said ._. PREMIUM TIMES leant that the presidency reached out to the APC governors individually through the official channel by raising what is called a 'signal' through the ADC of each governor ._. It was after getting the message that all the APC governors went to their various states on Wednesday morning ,_,  the aide said ,_,  adding that one wonders why the president is politicising something as crucial as insecurity that affects us all ._. Salihu Lukman ,_,  the Director General of Progressives Governors' Forum ,_,  the umbrella body of the APC governors ,_,  confirmed the same position to PREMIUM TIMES in a telephone interview on Thursday evening ._. The APC governors were even shocked to learn that the meeting held after they had been told it was postponed ,_,  Mr ._. 
Lukman said ._. The APC later released a statement in which it denied that its governors shunned the meeting with Jonathan ._. The opposition party later released a statement on Thursday saying its governors were deceived into believing the meeting had been called off ._. The spokesperson for the party ,_,  Lai Mohammed ,_,  said in a statement ,_,  On Wednesday ,_,  the Presidency called the Chief Detail of the Kwara State Government to say that the meeting had been called off ._. On the basis of this information ,_,  which apparently got to other governors under the aegis of the APC ,_,  our governors did not attend ._. Now that the meeting has been held ,_,  it is incumbent on the Presidency to launch an investigation into the source of the call to the Kwara State Government and what the call was meant to achieve ._. Irrespective of the totally unfounded and absolutely irresponsible allegation that the APC is behind the escalating security situation ,_,  our party will not shy away from any serious effort to end the terrorist attacks in our country ._. 
Therefore ,_,  it is not true that our Governors shunned the meeting with the President ._. The meetingThe meeting ,_,  which held at the Presidential Villa ,_,  was attended by President Jonathan ,_,  Vice President Nimadi Sambo ,_,  PDP governors ,_,  Governors Obiano and Mimiko ,_,  and the Service Chiefs ._. None of them disclosed the decisions reached at the parley ._. While speaking after the meeting ,_,  Mr ._. 
Akpabio warned that the security challenge should not be politcised ,_,  insisting that all hand must be on deck to contain the situation ._. We must face the situation and it is not something we can politicize ._. 
You don't politicise security ._. 
All hands must be on deck ,_,  the entire country every single Nigerian must contribute his quota towards bringing the current situation to an end ,_,  he said ._. I believe that if you are not a soldier you can also be an informant ._. 
And of course you know that this thing is becoming like an HIV if you are not infected you are affected ._. Your children are also involved ,_,  your grand children and relations ._. 
If people are now attacking schools to disrupt the lives of children how will you not be concern ._. 
A market woman is affected when motor parks are being bombed ,_,  so there is no way any governor in Nigeria will not be concerned and will not show interest ._. In bringing this situation to an end ,_,  all Nigerians must know that we must be our brothers' keepers as far as security is concern ,_,  the governor added ._. On what transpired at the meeting ,_,  Mr ._. 
Akpabio explained that the president listened to the attendees ._. Mr ._. 
President has listened to us and even said that since it is a problem that involves all the state of the federation ._. 
It is better for all the state governors to be in attendance ._. 
Because of that he has graciously agreed to meet with all the 36 states of the federation on Wednesday by 4 p ._. m ._.  ,_,  he said ._. Further defending the non -_: invitation of the opposition governors ,_,  Mr ._. 
Akpabio said ,_,  Of course you know we are very much concerned ,_,  first as PDP governors and the centre belongs to the PDP; and so we felt that we should see our dear president and if need be with some of the security chiefs ._. He has graciously listened to us and he said since is a national issue we must have all the 36 governors in attendance ._. 
So I believe strongly notice will be going out and all governors will be meeting with Mr ._. 
President and service chiefs next week Wednesday so we can sit and discuss and proffer solutions to the current insecurity in the country ._. 
I believe it will come to an end ._. When asked about the possible extension of the emergency rule in Borno ,_,  Yobe and Adamawa ,_,  Mr ._. 
Akpabio said Mr ._. 
Jonathan did not discuss it with the PDP governors ._. According to him ,_,  No he didn't go into details with us ._. 
Of course you know that is a national issue and if you discuss you can't shave a man's head behind him ._. 
The governors of the states that are involved in emergency are not here ._. 
So I believe that issue will be taken on when all the governors are around on Wednesday ._. Also speaking ,_,  the governor of Abia State ,_,  Theodore Orji ,_,  corroborated Mr ._. 
Akpabio ,_,  saying the parley was at the instance of the PDP governors ._. We undertook an essential discussion on the security of the nation; that is exactly what we did ._. 
Details are not for public because they are security issues ._. 
Of course no governor is happy with what has happened but bear in mind that the meeting is at the instant of the PDP Governors ,_,  Mr ._. 
Orji said ._. He also did not comment on why Messrs Mimiko and Obiano ,_,  two non -_: PDP governors ,_,  attended the meeting ._. We took a decision when we went to Jigawa and we requested the president to invite us to a meeting with the security chiefs ._. 
That is why we are here ._. 
We initiated the meeting for clearance ._. EDITOR'S NOTE :_:  This post has been updated with the statement by the Interim National Publicity Secretary of the APC ,_,  Lai Mohammed ._. 
The Borno state Commissioner for Education ,_,  Musa Kubo ,_,  on Thursday said a total of 20 girls have now been recorded as safely returning back to their homes after escaping from Boko Haram insurgents who abducted them from their school hostel on Monday ._. Mr ._. 
Kubo spoke with journalists in Maiduguri on telephone from Chibok town ._. I'm right at Government Girls Secondary School ,_, Chibok ,_,  the scene of the unfortunate abduction ._. 
At the moment we have taken custody of 20 girls ._. 
There is an increase of four students whose parents returned them to school after they ran home on the day of the attack ._. 
We had made announcements and called on parents whose children and wards ran home ,_,  to return them back; the aim is for us to take proper account of our 129 students who were at the hostel on the day of that unfortunate attack ._. You may recall that 14 students had earlier escaped from captivity as explained by our Governor ,_,  Kashim Shettima on Wednesday ._. 
By our records of 129 students being at the hostel at the time of that unfortunate incident ,_,  we are expecting the return of about 119 he probably meant 109 girls students who might be among those said to have been rescued by the Military ._. 
Myself ,_,  the principal of the school ,_, Asabe Kwambura ,_, parents ,_,  other students and residents are awaiting the return of our students ._. We have no reason to doubt or contradict Wednesday's announcement by the Defence Headquarters ,_,  given the fact that the Military personnel are those leading the search and rescue operations along with civilian volunteers ._. 
We are very hopeful that perhaps ,_,  the freed students are safe with the military and being brought to us ._. 
We pray that not just all our students return in good health but also all the security agents and volunteers safely return in good health after a successful and patriotic rescue effort ._. We call on parents to remain prayerful and hopeful that by the grace of God all the students will return to us in good health ._. 
On behalf of the Borno State Government ,_,  my ministry ,_,  staff and students of the affected school ,_, parents and relations of affected students ,_,  I deeply appreciate the concern of all Nigerians and rest of the world for their solidarity and well wishes ._. 
I also thank the media for their very critical role as we look forward to overcoming this grieving experience ._.

Some of the victims have been discharged from hospitals ._. The Nigerian government on Thursday released a list of 126 victims admitted in various hospitals after the bomb explosion in Nyanya ,_,  Abuja ,_,  on Monday morning ._. At least 75 people were killed in an explosion that rocked a populous motor park in Nyanya ,_,  a suburb of Abuja ,_,  Nigeria's capital city ._. 
The explosion is believed to have been carried out by the Boko Haram terrorist group ._. The explosion ,_,  which occurred on Monday morning ,_,  also left over 100 people injured; some of who are receiving treatment in various hospitals within and around Abuja ._. The list was made available by the Senior Information Officer ,_,  National Emergency Management Agency ,_,  NEMA ,_,  Sani Batti ._. 
Some of the victims have ,_,  however ,_,  been discharged from the hospitals ._. The federal government had earlier given approval for hospital authorities to release the corpses of the dead to their families ._.

It is a false allegation aimed at tarnishing my image and reputation in the hope of destroying my political and electoral standings ,_,  and that of my party ,_,  the APC ,_,  in the country ._. Firstly ,_,  it is public knowledge that Boko Haram as a terror organisation long preceded the 2011 presidential elections ._. 
My utterances or lack of them on the 2011 presidential election could not therefore have created nor sustained the Boko Haram insurgency ._.

The PDP has accused the All Progressive Congress APC of aiding and abetting terrorism in the country through omission and commission ._.

The Peoples Democratic Party PDP has criticised governors of the All Progressives Congress APC for shunning President Goodluck Jonathan's meeting to discuss the security challenges in the country ._. Mohammed :_:  Promised not to dignify PDP's allegations and Metuh :_:  APC is championing anarchyThis is contained in a statement by Mr Olisa Metuh ,_,  PDP National Publicity Secretary ,_,  in Abuja on Thursday ._.

But what further proof can there be of the culpability of the APC than the decision of its governors to shun the National Security Council meeting called by the President ,_,  he said ._.

They may make the appropriate noises from time to time ,_,  but in the fight against terrorism ,_,  actions speak louder than words ._. 
IN the best case scenario ,_, countries rally together in moments of national crisis ._. 
They put aside superficial divisions; suspend deep -_: seated hostilities to create the necessary national accord to defeat a nation -_: threatening crisis ._. 
Many examples abound in history ._. The British allied faced with the danger of the Third Reich; the Soviet Union made the greatest sacrifice in the Second World War ,_,  losing about 25million people ,_,  rallying in the face of Nazi aggression even Nigeria found common purpose to end the secessionist project of the 1960s ._. 
When nations rally in the face of crisis ,_,  they collectively work to ward off danger ._. 
Nigeria is in crisis today; big time !_. 
But politics can hinder the ability to come together ._. 
Nigerian politics is characterised by unhealthy suspicions between its elite groups; the entrenched rivalries across region and religion; between North and South ._. 
Even the mutually destructive anti -_: state insurgency; kidnappings and killings in our country today ,_,  can't reduce these suspicions; they threaten our ability to rally ._. On Monday morning ,_,  I sponsored a motion at the National Conference ._. 
But it was not straight forward; because as the day's session opened ,_,  and against the backdrop of the early morning bombing in Abuja ,_,  Dan Nwanyanwu of the Nigeria Labour Party moved a motion that was seconded by Mike Ozekhome SAN ._. The motion threatened what we had submitted to the Conference Leadership to concentrate minds about the killings in several parts of Northern Nigeria ._. 
I had argued prior to sponsoring the motion ,_,  that we should use the crisis situation to build bridges to other Nigerians and use it to deepen unity within the National Conference and Nigeria in general ._. 
My position was canvassed because rumour was rife that Northern Delegates planned to boycott sittings for two days ,_,  to protest the security situation in the North ._. 
Frankly ,_,  I thought it was wrong strategy ._. 
I reminded the Northern Delegates' Forum ,_,  that when students of the FGC in Yobe state were murdered in cold blood ,_,  parents in Southern Nigeria demonstrated against the killings ._. 
They were not obliged to do so ,_,  but they made a powerful statement for our collective humanity and helped to bring us together as Nigerians ._. Joint statement against insurgencyI argued further that we should rally other delegates to jointly make a statement of unity against the insurgency in the North; the killings of innocent ,_,  poor people and the wanton destruction of infrastructure in the most underdeveloped regions of Nigeria ._. By winning the buy -_: in of our colleagues into our concern ,_,  we would emphasise the pan -_: Nigerian nature of the problem; bring ourselves together and help to reduce the mutual suspicions that the Boko Haram insurgency engendered in the country ._. 
The narrative for many in Southern Nigeria ,_,  was that the insurgency was sponsored by the Northern political elite ,_,  against the presidency of Goodluck Jonathan ._. 
In recent months ,_,  there is a shift of grounds; the indiscriminate ferocity of recent killings have made many people to reconsider their perception ._. 
And by winning the empathy of all delegates ,_,  I strongly argued ,_,  that we would have done more for national unity ._. But old prejudices and suspicions resemble Pavlov's dog in the old scientific experiment; they have become conditioned reflexes amongst the Nigerian political elite ._. 
By Monday morning ,_,  BLUEPRINT newspaper ,_,  which is well circulated at the National Conference ,_,  led with the story that Northern Delegates had a plan to boycott the conference ._. 
That must have conditioned attitudes on the other side of the Nigerian political divide ._. 
The Nyaya bombing seemed to then lend some incendiary residuals to the charged atmosphere against which plenary held on Monday ._. 
The rival motions which ought to have brought us together ,_,  just opened a bit more the chasm of suspicion located in the Nigerian political arena ._. 
So from trying to use the crises situation to rally ourselves ,_,  we ended up becoming even more suspicious of each other and the bitterness that people were barely suppressing like an active volcano released some hot political lava by Tuesday's meeting ,_,  when a choreographed response was let out again ,_,  by those who felt the Conference Leadership had shown bias towards my motion ,_,  in refusing to record Dan Nwayanwu's first motion from Monday morning ._. 
Even when an emendation was cobbled together by the leadership ,_,  a retired military administrator from AkwaIbom ,_,  objected to the third item of my motion ,_,  which had asked for reconstruction and rehabilitation of crises affected areas of Northern Nigeria !_. 
Whatever was applicable to those areas in the North must equally be done in the South ._. I have never underrated the depth of the divides in Nigeria ._. 
There is incredible suspicion bordering on near -_: hatred in some circles ._. 
Much of these negative feelings built up over the decades as rivalry within the political elite deepened in the desperacy to control power and the accruing riches ._. 
The National Conference accentuates these hostilities; suspicions and mutually reinforcing prejudices ._. 
But what is clear to me too ,_,  is that there is no way a nation can be successfully constructed where the elites deeply distrust themselves as those in Nigeria ._. 
The fact that we could not rally ourselves with the crises situation that threaten all of us ,_,  just underscores the danger which Nigeria faces into the future ._. Borno's baggage of despair and hopeI MADE up my mind to write about political developments in Borno state ,_,  in the wake of the reported rapproachment between Governor Kashim Shettima and former Governor Ali Modu Sherriff ._. 
It was clear that all was not well between the two ,_,  and in the build up to the 2015 election ,_,  the struggle to control the ruling APC and who would be the party's gubernatorial candidate ,_,  would be the central issues ._. 
The portents were frightening; and Borno could not afford the looming political crisis ,_,  especially with the ongoing Boko Haram insurgency ._. Tremendous efforts had been invested into the development process by Governor Kashim Shettima ,_,  as I have written on this page in the past :_:  agricultural projects; developments in education; empowerment processes for youth and women; renewal of the urban areas; infrastructural development ,_,  and so on ._. 
These developments will take a backburner once the negative elements of the politics of 2015 preoccupy all sides ._. 
Just when the worst seemed inevitable ,_,  it was announced that hatchets had been buried in Borno ,_,  following clear -_: the -_: air meetings between Governor Shettima and former governor Sherriff ._. 
And the process was facilitated by Alhaji Kashim Ibrahim Imam ._. Incidentally ,_,  Imam is a delegate at the on -_: going National Conference ._. 
On Monday this week ,_,  I discussed the Borno scenario with him ._. 
He gave me a detailed analysis and why it became imperative to work for peace ,_,  because in the long run ,_,  it was about Borno's future !_. 
Kashim Imam said there was no way that the war of attrition would not further the suffering of the people ._. 
A people that have been visited by the depredations of Boko Haram must not suffer the double jeopardy of political warfare within and amongst members of the elite ._. 
That all sides of the feud chose to bury the hatchet was a major statement of leadership responsibility ,_,  the kind that this moment in Borno demands of all its elites ._. Abducted female studentsBut we were talking effusively about political reconciliation ,_,  when the story broke of the abduction of over 100 female students from a secondary school in Chibok ,_,  Borno state ._. 
Armed groups around Africa in recent years have targeted young school girls ,_,  as booties of war ._. 
The Ugandan Lord Resistance Army; the RUF in Sierra Leone and now Boko Haram in Nigeria ,_,  have abducted young girls ._. These young girls ,_,  according to the experience ,_,  were turned into sex slaves !_. 
As a parent of daughters myself ,_,  I feel the pains of the parents and relations of the abducted young girls ._. 
These are communities with some of the lowest enrolment figures in schools in Nigeria especially those of the girl child ,_,  and to lose over 100 girls to abductors is the worst form of trauma for the children and their families ._. 
But above all else ,_,  it can set back every effort to improve education in these communities ._. 
It is therefore important that every effort be made to rescue the children but we must also offer counseling opportunities to them ,_,  their parents and communities ._. Re :_:  Fulbe Nomads :_:  From negative profiling to ethnic cleansingLAST week on this page ,_,  I wrote about the unending negative profiling of the Fulbe nomads and the new and dangerous effort at ethnically cleansing Fulbe people in different parts of Nigeria ._. 
The most recent was the killings perpetrated by the Nigerian Army in Keana ,_,  Nasarawa state ._. 
I also noted the role of the Nigerian media in that dangerous trend ,_,  making a particular note of THE NATION newspapers titles in the profiling of the Fulbe nomad ._. The reader will recall that I mentioned my discussion with Sam Omatseye ,_,  Chairman of the Editorial Board of THE NATION newspapers ._. 
Last Friday ,_,  he called me and angrily objected to my mentioning his name in the piece ,_,  because it linked him directly with the issues I had raised ._. 
Sam Omatseye reminded me that we did not conclude our discussion three weeks ago ,_,  because we were about to commence plenary at the National Conference ._. He was right !_. 
We did not conclude our discussion and I should not have brought him into my narrative ._. 
I assured Sam that I did not intend to impugn his person whatsoever ,_,  and as a sign of my goodwill ,_,  I have decided to make this full disclosure this week ._. What I said about the general pattern of media coverage and profiling of the Fulbe retains its poignancy ._. 
In a moment like we have in Nigeria today ,_,  especially in Northern Nigeria ,_,  with the tragic killings ,_,  wanton destruction of properties and the unconscionable kidnap of young women ,_,  it has become even more imperative for the media to be more professional in its fidelity to the facts ._. 
These are times of very deep wounds and emotions in our country ,_,  and people can easily lose their heads and precipitate even worse crises than we are grappling with at the moment ._. We must do everything to assist the growth of tendencies of peaceful co -_: existence amongst our peoples; the profiling of the Fulbe or any other communities will not assist such a process ._. 
Nigeria is not winning in the battle against Boko Haram ,_,  but neither are the Islamist militants ._. 
The Abuja bombing is more a sign of the group's decline than ascendency ._. At approximately 06 :_: 45 on the morning of 14 April ,_,  an explosion ripped through the Nyanya Motor Park in the bustling city of Abuja ._. 
The blast ,_,  which triggered secondary explosions as nearby vehicles were engulfed in flames ,_,  occurred as scores of commuters were readying themselves for their daily commute into the centre of the Nigerian capital ._. 
By the time the smoke had settled and the sounds of screams were displaced by those of sirens ,_,  in excess of 70 people had been killed and scores others wounded in the deadliest attack of this nature to ever occur in the city ._. While there have been no immediate claims of responsibility ,_,  suspicion has fallen on the Islamist militant group Boko Haram ._. 
Since its formation in 2002 ,_,  Boko Haram has waged an armed insurgency against the Nigerian government which has left an estimated 5 ,_, 000 people dead and thousands more displaced ._. 
According to Amnesty International ,_,  1 ,_, 500 of these deaths have occurred since the beginning of 2014 ,_,  marking a recent upsurge in attacks both in frequency and brutality ._. 
Reports of civilian massacres attributed to Boko Haram have become a near daily occurrence in Nigeria's north -_: east which has long served as the group's operational stronghold ._. The increase in violence has many believing that the Nigerian government is losing the battle against Boko Haram ._. 
Moreover ,_,  incidents such as the 14 April attack in Abuja raise concerns that the Islamist group could be expanding its campaign to areas outside its traditional areas of operation ,_,  potentially placing major cities at sustained risk ._. In assessing the credence of such concerns ,_,  however ,_,  it should be noted that the attack at the Nyanya Motor Park was not the first Boko Haram attack in Abuja ._. 
On 16 June 2011 ,_,  a suicide bomber breached the perimeter of Nigeria's police headquarters Louis Edet house in what was likely an attempt to assassinate then Inspector -_: General of Police ,_,  Hafiz Ringim ._. 
In a telephone interview conducted with a Nigerian newspaper ,_,  Boko Haram spokesman Abu Zaid claimed responsibility for the attack which killed one police officer and left several others wounded ._. Two months later ,_,  Boko Haram then executed one of the most high -_: profile attacks in its decade -_: long insurgency when another suicide bomber drove his explosive -_: laden vehicle into the entrance of a building in Abuja's Garki district housing the offices of the United Nations ._. 
At least 21 people were killed and 76 wounded in the attack which Boko Haram claimed was a reprisal for security operations targeting its members in the northern city of Kano ._. Boko Haram's attacks in Abuja continued in 2012 when the group claimed responsibility for the 26 April bombing of the offices of the ThisDay news media publications and when its suspected offshoot ,_,  Ansaru ,_,  launched a daring raid on a prison facility in Abuja's Apo district where a number of Boko Haram insurgents were being detained ._. The aforementioned incidents highlighted that Boko Haram possessed both the intent and operational capacity to execute attacks in Abuja which ,_,  while perhaps not as deadly ,_,  were more sophisticated in both their operational planning and execution in comparison to the recent Nyanaya Motor Park bombing ._. But if Boko Haram had the requisite capabilities to execute attacks in Abuja with relative frequency ,_,  why has there been a near two -_: year lull in its operations in the capital The answer lies in the fact that despite mainstream narratives suggesting the contrary ,_,  counterinsurgency measures employed by the Nigerian government have indeed weakened the group ._. Boko Haram's attacks in contextSince a multi -_: pronged counteroffensive was launched against Boko Haram's positions and interests in early 2013 ,_,  there has been a marked decline in the group's attacks outside Nigeria's north -_: east ._. 
Prior to the aforementioned offensive ,_,  Boko Haram was rapidly expanding its operational footprint across Nigeria ,_,  permeating both the north -_: western and central administrative regions of the country ._. 
In addition to attacking Abuja with a degree of frequency ,_,  Boko Haram was also particularly active in Kano ,_,  Kaduna and Plateau states and had even conducted operations as far south as Kogi state ._. By the end of 2012 ,_,  a major Boko Haram attack in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos ,_,  which had so far been spared ,_,  seemed inevitable ._. 
However ,_,  the group's rapid expansion was abruptly halted in May 2013 following the implementation of a state of emergency in the north -_: eastern states of Adamawa ,_,  Borno and Yobe ,_,  which have and continue to be worst affected by the insurgency ._. 
The emergency decree ,_,  which provided the military with additional powers in combating the militants ,_,  was soon followed up with sustained air and ground offensives which the Nigerian military claims killed hundreds of Boko Haram members and destroyed key bases in the Sambisa Forest region of Borno state ._. In the months following the May 2013 offensive ,_,  Boko Haram restricted their operations to Nigeria's north -_: east ._. 
Apart from the reduction in the geographical scope of its attacks ,_,  there was also a shift in the group's modus operandi ._. 
Attacks utilising suicide bombers declined ,_,  while armed attacks targeting fortified facilities such as police stations ,_,  military barracks and detention centres similarly became less frequent ._. 
Instead ,_,  Boko Haram shifted its focus to soft civilian targets ,_,  launching attacks on vulnerable and isolated towns ,_,  villages and schools ,_,  which often had a minimal or non -_: existent security presence ._. A group which had been touted as being better equipped and trained than the Nigerian military ,_,  and which had exhibited this superiority in brazen and sophisticated attacks against hardened targets ,_,  was now waging a more conventional and risk adverse form of guerrilla warfare ._. 
Although high -_: profile attacks have not ceased in their entirety ,_,  as witnessed by the December 2013 attack at the Borno Air Force base and the more recent assault on the Giwa barracks ,_,  these incidents have been sporadic and mostly limited to the city of Maiduguri where Boko Haram has always maintained a strong operational presence ._. While spiralling casualty figures show that the Nigerian army is certainly not winning the battle against Boko Haram ,_,  it would be wrong to suggest that Boko Haram is exactly winning either ._. 
Although tragic and brutal attacks continue relentlessly ,_,  the tactics employed by the Nigerian army have ,_,  at the very least ,_,  stymied the Boko Haram's geographical expansion and curtailed its ability to execute attacks against targets of strategic security and/or governmental importance ._. In this regard ,_,  we should be careful when drawing conclusions about the 14 April attack at Abuja's Nyanya Motor Park ._. 
If Boko Haram was indeed responsible ,_,  it is unlikely that the incident marks the beginning of any sustained campaign by the militants in Nigeria's capital ,_,  or indeed anywhere else outside the country's north -_: east ._. 
Instead ,_,  the attack could be seen more of a reflection of a militant group aware of its operational decline yet which is still intent on posturing itself as a threat of national proportions ._.

There's confusion over the fate of kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls ._. 
SA prepares for a post -_: Zuma ANC ._. The Nigerian media are irritated by confusion over the fate of more than 100 students abducted by Boko Haram Islamist insurgents from a secondary school in Borno StateThe army reported on Wednesday that about 80 of the girls had been released ._. 
Punch reports that the pncipal of the college has denied claims by the Defence Headquarters that only eight of the pupils had yet to regain their freedom ._. The Nigeria Tribune shares the anguish of the school's principal who told the Associated Press on Thursday how she mistakenly handed over 129 schoolgirls to Boko Haram gunmen ,_,  who posed as military men ._. 
According to the paper ,_,  the principal said that the insurgents dressed in military fatigues arrived at the school after midnight and told her they needed to move the girls for their own safety ._. 
She says they then loaded the students on to the back of a truck and it was when they started shooting ,_,  as they left the campus that she realised her mistake ._. The Guardian reports that Defence Headquarters has confirmed the principal's account noting that only 14 out of the 129 girls have been freed ._. This Day claims that the 14 of the students were able to escape when one of the trucks in which they were being carted away broke down ._. 
And Daily Trust says that the parents of the teenage girls have joined the search efforts in the dreaded Sambisa Forest to try to find their daughters ._. In South Africa the press is following the campaign trail ahead of the 7 May general election ._. 
The Mail and Guardian hints that the battle for the post -_: Zuma ANC has begun well before the country holds the crucial poll ._. 
The paper claims that once the president sanctions his new cabinet ,_,  those he over looks will look for new alliances as the focus turns to who will lead the party in 2017 ._. The Johannesburg Star has already identified former intelligence minister Ronnie Kasrils and former health minister Nosizwe Madlala -_: Routledge among the disgruntled former ANC stalwarts who have started looking for a different political godfather ._. 
It reports that the two rebels from the Limpopo constituency launched a Vote no !_.  campaign on Tuesday to show disquiet at the plague of corruption bedevilling the ANC ,_,  accusing Jacob Zuma of opulence that smacks of Mobutu Sese -_: Sekoism ._. This over the security upgrades at the president's private home in Nkandla ._. City Press says Limpopo residents yelled and signalled for officials to go away and even pelted a few cars on a nearby road briefly plunging a packed Malamulele stadium into chaos as Zuma addressed an ANC campaign rally ._. The Sowetan hails a victory for freedom of expression after the elections complaints and compliance commission ordered the public SABC broadcaster to air six campaign adverts prepared by the opposition Democratic Alliance with immediate effect ._. 
The paper explains that the television advert and five radio ads were pulled off air after being blighted by the SABC for two days on grounds that they were packed with personal attacks ._. 
The PDP is making the claim despite the comments attributed to the leader of the PDP governor's forum ,_,  Goodswill Akpabio ,_,  that the APC governors were not invited ._. The Peoples Democratic Party ,_,  PDP ,_,  is insisting that governors of the All Progressives Congress ,_,  APC ,_,  were invited to Wednesday's enlarged meeting of the National Security Council in Abuja but that they failed to attend ._. This claim is despite the admission by the Chairman of the PDP Governors' Forum ,_,  Godswill Akpabio ,_,  that the 16 APC governor did not attend the meeting because they were not invited ._. No ,_,  No ,_,  No; they APC governors were not invited ,_,  Mr ._. 
Akpabio ,_,  a member of President Goodluck Jonathan's PDP ,_,  told journalists after the security meeting ._. You know there was an initial requisition of this meeting by the PDP governors ,_,  this was as a fallout of our own meeting ._. 
And so it wasn't something that was extended to all ,_,  he said ._. But in a press statement by its spokesperson ,_,  Olisa Metuh ,_,  the PDP claimed all governors were invited and that the APC shunned the meeting because it was unhappy that security agents were closing in on the perpetrators of the Nyanya attack ._. See the PDP's full statement below :_: Actions Speak Louder Than Words !_. When we said that the All Progressive Congress ,_,  APC ,_,  as it is presently constituted ,_,  aids and abets terror in Nigeria by omission and commission ,_,  some Nigerians doubted us ._. But what further proof can there be of the culpability of the APC than the decision of its governors to shun the National Security Council meeting called by the President to deliberate on ways to bring the sponsors of terror and their foot men to bookGovernment is different from politics and it is quite unfortunate that in the pursuance of politics APC Govs shunned a meeting to secure the nations integrity and protect the lives of Nigerians ._. It is important to note that APC governors do not shun meetings where the Federal Government takes care of their financial interests ._. 
But as this meeting is meant to take care of the interests of Nigerians ,_,  they shunned it ._. Could it be that the APC is not happy with the news by the police and security agents that they are closing in on the perpetrators of the Nyanya bombing even as they were able to recover the body of the bomberIt is certainly more than curious that the APC governors ,_,  particularly those whose states are at the thick of the Boko Haram insurgency are the once who are trying to subvert meetings called to address the malaise ._. Nigerians should be conscious of their antics and read the body language of the APC ._. 
They may make the appropriate noises from time to time ,_,  but in the fight against terrorism ,_,  actions speak louder than words !_. Signed :_: Olisa MetuhNational Publicity Secretary
Maiduguri � Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State was unable to attend the governors' meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Abuja yesterday because he was eager to see that the secondary school girls abducted by suspected Boko Haram insurgents are freed ._. Malam Isa Umar Gusau ,_,  the Special Adviser to the governor on Communications ,_,  said Shettima decided to remain in the state to give encouragement to distraught parents ._. According to him ,_,  The governor leaving the state at this trying moment would demoralize dozens of families that are waiting to see their daughters ._. 
He did not in any way boycott the meeting ,_,  Gusau said ._. 
The Nigerian security department ,_,  the last remaining ,_,  touted vestige of decency in the nation ,_,  the military and entire security network of the nation right up to the office of national security ,_,  ONSA and the Ministry of Defenceis today facing many challenges ._. In September last year ,_,  a story broke about a security massacre of innocent citizens squatting in a building in Apo area ,_,  Abuja ._. 
The Nigerian forces had reportedly simply fired upon squatting civilians who they were reportedly trying to evict from the building ._. 
The security department claimed it was a battle with terrorists and that guns were found ._. 
Their claims were all later proven to be lies and this month the Nigerian Human Rights NHRC indicted the Directorate of State Security ,_,  DSS of murder ._. Prior to this ,_,  there had been several reports and serious complaints by human right associations and concerned citizens that the military was killing as many or more innocent civilians than the terrorists were ,_,  as it battled Boko Haram in the North ._. 
There were and still are many complaints of the military actually withdrawing forces to permit Boko Haram terror attacks ,_,  including in the killing of distinguished army veteran ,_,  General Muhammed Shuwa in 2012 ,_,  in whose case it was reported that soldiers actually watched as he was killed ._. In February of this month ,_,  the Nigerian president threatened to pull out forces to illustrate to the northern leadership the effect of the military in the north; shortly after his announcement ,_,  there was a reported pull out of troops stationed near a school in Yobe which was subsequently attacked by terrorists ,_,  with dozens of students massacred ._. About a hundred military dressed gunmen or groups of this number have been ravaging the Middle Belt of Nigeria ,_,  killing all people in sight and burning buildings in towns they visit ._. 
This situation has never been accosted by the Nigerian security department and has lasted for three years ._. 
It was believed that there were no leads ,_,  however an exasperated community head of the recently attacked Yar Galadima village in Zamfara where 250 were killed ,_,  revealed that the perpetrators and their camps were known by the town's men and the security department; and that several had been arrested and released to continue their mayhem ._. 
The village head even gave the names of the terror leaders arrested and released by the state security department ._. In Keana ,_,  a town in Nasarawa state ,_,  this month at least 15 civilians were summarily executed while burying a relative ._. 
The attack was initially reported in the nation's top dailies as a successful military engagement against terrorists ,_,  however as the actual details unfolded and it was found to be a military men massacre of innocent cooperating civilians ,_,  the military retracted their ownership and submitted that an investigation was being conducted into the true occurrences ._. This same April ,_,  a Voice of America ,_,  VoA broadcast suggested that there was top level military ,_,  treasonable sabotage ,_,  with military on military ambushes and slaughters of the nation's security men by their own trainers ._. 
The report captioned ,_,  Army ,_,  Boko Haram Working Together in Parts of Nigeria was a seriously embarrassing news piece ,_,  which the Nigerian military quickly denied ,_,  claiming the soldier who made the revelation was not a real soldier in the Nigerian army; however since the report ,_,  we have spoken with other military men ,_,  including others attacked in the same reported ambush ,_,  who substantiated the report that they were left with one or two magazines and ambushed by their own military ._. A recent report also alleged that junior officers had complained that the generals were undermining the mission of the army in Borno ,_,  embezzling funds for security equipment and mobilizations ,_,  sometimes placing two army units in one zone to reduce costs while sabotaging security delivery ._. 
The report revealed that ammunition was in inadequate supply ,_,  allowing the superiorly kitted Boko Haram terrorists ,_,  with things like night -_: vision goggles Nigeria's troops did not have ,_,  and more rounds of superior ammunition ,_,  the capacity to defeat the Nigerian army ._. 
Even food was scroungy ,_,  further defeating the morale of the soldiers ._. In latest news reports ,_,  according to the Borno government office ,_,  the school involved and the populace ,_,  the Nigerian military dangerously lied about the release of the abducted 100+ girls ._. 
The military had claimed it had released the girls; this was allegedly a very evil and deadly lie ,_,  as the citizens said their wards were still in the bushes with the terrorists ._. Nigeria's security department has visibly ,_,  deliberately failed to curb terror freely plaguing the nation; not a single sponsor of terror has ever been prosecuted ,_,  despite preponderance of evidence including the Abba Moro White report indicting Borno politicians in the establishment of Boko Haram ._. 
These politicians exiled by the Borno populace now live safe in the nation's capital ._. 
The army has also been accused of not responding for up to eight hours when villages call and report impending and ongoing attacks ._. 
Helicopters have been reported to be surprisingly flying in Nigeria's monitored air spaces across the north ,_,  also indicating dangerous compromise and sabotage of the army and State security department ._. 
The security department seems further compromised ,_,  accused of aiding and abetting terror and lying to condone military massacres and failures ._. When Nigeria's former head of state security ,_,  NSA Andrew Owoye -_: Azazi had revealed that terror in the nation as not accidental but was sponsored and supported by top ruling -_: party ,_,  PDP politicians ,_,  he was fired ,_,  and killed in a helicopter crash later that year ._. 
Nigeria is today in a very precarious situation as terror increases across the nation ,_,  especially its northern parts ._. 
More than 21 ,_, 000 people have died of the violence since Jonathan came into power ._. 
Not a single sponsor of terror has been prosecuted by this government ._. 
Contrary to the long standing negative public perception of the judiciary and law enforcement agencies including anti -_: graft outfits ,_,  the National Human Rights Commission NHRC earned for itself the confidence of Nigerians through its recent verdict over the wrongful killing ,_,  last year ,_,  of eight migrant workers in Abuja ._. In the 83 -_: page final report on the killings following six months of investigations and public testimonies ,_,  Chairman of the Governing Board of the NHRC Professor Chidi Odinkalu stated that there was no credible evidence to prove that the victims who belonged to the National Association of Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association NATOMORAS were members of the Boko Haram sect ._.  the report also added that the claim by the SSS on self defense did not have any fact or evidence to kill the victims ._. 
Instead ,_,  the victims according to the report were non -_: combatant civilians ._. 
The report thus observed that the application of lethal force was disproportionate and the killing of the eight deceased persons as well as injuries caused to the eleven other survivors were unlawful; adding that there is no basis in law for confining detainees freed by the Respondents to internal banishment ._. The NHRC in the popular verdict indicted the Nigerian Army NA and the State Security Service SSS for their role in the unlawful killing of eight and the wounding of twelve others who were taking shelter in an uncompleted building in the Apo area of Abuja city ._. 
Most of those arrested during the operation have been released while others have been banished from Abuja for two years and warned not to talk to the press; a decision widely condemned ._. A combined team of the army and the SSS in the early hours of September 20 ,_,  2013 stormed an uncompleted building where several migrant workers many of them Keke -_: NAPEP operators and wheel barrow pushers were squatting ._. 
The security operatives claimed they had an intelligence report that occupants of the uncompleted building were Boko Haram insurgents who were using the place as a hide -_: out ._. 
The security forces in the course of defending their action also argued that they came under fire and thus responded in self -_: defense ._. 
Preliminary investigations revealed that the building belonged to an army officer who wanted the illegal squatters out of the place; and thus ,_,  chose to label them as Boko Haram members ._. 
The mere fact that other suspected Boko Haram hide -_: outs were demolished and the landlord of the uncompleted property was neither prosecuted nor his edifice pulled down gives room to suspect a conspiracy between the army and the SSS ._. It became glaring after investigations that the unfortunate incident was a pure case of profiling designed to serve the interest of the owner of the uncompleted property ._. 
We call on security agencies to desist from profiling poor and unemployed Muslims as Boko Haram members in order to justify their killing ._. 
The SSS ,_,  for instance ,_,  is not by its statutory duties known to be a combat or killer squad ._. 
Rather ,_,  it is professionally an intelligence outfit; and should work towards perfecting that function ._. The NHRC in its verdict awards the sum of ten million naira as compensation for each of the deceased to be paid by the Government of the Federation ._. 
The AGF is to ensure that evidence of payment is lodged with the Registry of the NHRC within thirty days of this decision ._. 
The second and third Respondents are restrained from the use of administrative banishment against any of the survivors ._. One crucial aspect of the NHRC report is that part of the report which requires the Respondents to undertake a review and harmonization of the Rules of Engagement governing the operations of security agencies to bring them into compliance with the applicable rules of international humanitarian law governing non -_: international armed conflicts ._. 
In order to show respect for the rule of law ,_,  the Respondents are encouraged ,_,  as requested by the NHRC ,_,  to file a certified text of the harmonized and updated Rules of Engagement with the NHRC within the time frame of two months given by the NHRC ._. While section 221 of the NHRC Act as amended requires it to register the report and decision for enforcement with the Federal High Court in the Federal Capital Territory ,_,  we call on all indicted parties to respect the judgment ._. Daily Trust commends the NHRC for carrying out a detailed investigation in to the matter and giving a fair judgment ._. 
This singular verdict is a testimony that in spite of the deep -_: seated corruption in the Nigerian system ,_,  individuals as heads of organizations like the current Chief Executive of the NHRC can make a lot of difference if given the opportunity ._. 
The Nigerian military has retracted a statement it made earlier this week that indicated most of the girls abducted from a secondary school had been freed ._. Major General Chris Olukolade says a field report indicated a major breakthrough in the search for the missing girls and there was no reason to doubt this official channel ._. He said the information had been forwarded to the public in good faith and was not intended to deceive the public ._. The defense ministry issued Olukolade's statement late Thursday ,_,  a day after Nigeria's Joint Information Center said that all but eight of the more than 100 students who were kidnapped Monday had been freed ._. 
The school's principal quickly denied the report ._. On Monday ,_,  unidentified gunmen launched an attack in the northeastern town of Chibok and kidnapped the 12 -_:  to 17 -_: year old girls ._. There were no immediate claims of responsibility ,_,  but the assault is similar to attacks that have been carried out by the Boko Haram militant group ._. At least 20 of the girls have managed to escape on their own ._. 
Borno State Commissioner for Education ,_,  Hon ._. 
Musa Inuwa Kubo ,_,  on Thursday night told journalists by telephone that that the number of girls that escaped the Boko Haram captivity had now risen to 20 ._. The commissioner ,_,  who spoke to journalists from the precinct of the attacked Government Girls Secondary School GGSS Chibok ,_,  125km away form Maiduguri ,_,  said some of the girls showed up after escaping from their captors between Monday and Tuesday ._. We have recovered about 20 girls now and they are with us ._. 
After they escaped ,_,  the girls went to village heads that live close to where they found themselves and the local leaders brought them to us ,_,  Kubo said ._. The commissioner said he was together with the school principal ,_,  and other stakeholders of Chibok community ,_,  as well as parents of the abducted girls ,_,  right inside the attacked school waiting to see if the military would bring forth any of the rescued girls as claimedI am here in Chibok with the parents and we are waiting to receive the recovered girls ._. 
Honestly we are not disputing what the military said because it bothers on security ._. 
The soldiers know better but we are yet to see the girls ._. 
We are hoping that they would be reunited with their families soon ,_,  said the education commissioner who was once the Speaker Borno state House of Assembly ._. LEADERSHIP can report that on the first night of the attack four of the abducted girls managed to escape on their own; on the second day ,_,  ten of them escaped captivity and made back to town; while two others ,_,  according to security operatives ,_,  were founding wandering in the bush and were helped to get back to Chibok by soldiers on patrol ._. The latest four were brought back to the school premises yesterday by local chief to whom the girls fled to take refuge after escaping ._. 
Christian faithful in Nigeria joined their counterpart worldwide to celebrate the passion and death of Jesus Christ on Good Friday ._. Good Friday marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary ._. In Lagos ,_,  some clergy in their messages urged the leaders at all levels of government to imbibe the spirit of selflessness as demonstrated by Jesus Christ ._. They said Good Friday was a day of deep penitence for Christians to reflect on the life and death of Christ who paid the supreme price for human redemption ._. Most Rev ._.

In Nsukka ,_,  Enugu State ,_,  the Overseer of Christ Victory Church ,_,  Pastor Edwin Urama ,_,  said what Nigerians needed to restore peace and unity was to rededicate themselves to God in prayer ._. The insurgency facing the country is the handiwork of the devil to tear the country apart ._. We must seek God's intervention so as to end the present senseless killings and destruction of property by Boko Haram ._. With prayer and absolute trust in God ,_,  the present insurgency will be a thing of the past ,_,  Urama said ._. He urged Nigerians to celebrate Easter by loving and forgiving one another as Jesus Christ did for us ._. For us to be good Christians we should forgive and pray for those who persecute us ,_,  he saidIn Ibadan ,_,  Pastor Isaac Bamisaye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God Blessed Parish Agbokojo ,_,  Ibadan ,_,  said the situation in Nigeria could only be solved by prayer and God ._. We need to humble ourselves and cry to God because only prayer and God's intervention will bring serenity in Nigeria ,_,  Bamisaye said ._. He said that Easter should be celebrated by showing love to one another because Jesus died and resurrected for the salvation of the whole world ._. The cleric also urged Nigerians to stop complaining ,_,  but pray for their leaders for God to lead them aright ._. I believe when all of us do what we should do and call on God ,_,  He will hear us and heal our land ._. In Bauchi ,_,  Rev ._.

The extremist Boko Haram sect has claimed responsibility for Monday's deadly car bomb at Nyanya bus station near Abuja ,_,  which killed at least 75 people and injured 124 more ._. We are the ones that carried out the attack in Abuja ,_,  Boko Haram's leader ,_,  Abubakar Shekau ,_,  was quoted as saying in a new video obtained by the AFP news agency ._. PREMIUM TIMES has not independently verified the report ,_,  but the French news agency has published several videos from the extremist group in the past ._. 
The agency said the video was delivered in a manner consistent with previous videos from the Boko Haram sect ._. In the 28 -_: minute clip ,_,  Mr ._. 
Shekau is dressed in military uniform and sits with a Kalashnikov resting on his left shoulder ,_,  the AFP reported ._. 
He spoke in both Arabic and Hausa ._. We are in your city but you don't know where we are ,_,  the terrorist leader quipped at President Goodluck Jonathan ._. The Nyanya car bomb targeted ordinary working class people leaving early for work in Abuja's city centre ._. 
Police and witnesses have spoken of a lone man driving a Volkswagen Gulf into the packed bus station and detonating the bomb -_: laden car ._. The attack was followed hours later by the mass abduction of at least 129 girls from Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok ,_,  Borno State ._. The state authorities say 44 of the girls have now been joined with the families having escaped from their captors ._. The video made no reference to the kidnappings ._.
