No quit for underdog Bobcats in loss that ends season 27-win campaign ends at hands of Arizona State in first round of 'Big Dance' By Matt Lardner Photo Credits: Calvin Mattheis/Ohio Athletics Photo Caption: Quiera Lampkins goes up for a shot during the Ohio women’s first-round NCAA Tournament loss to Arizona State in Tempe on Saturday. With a game that never broke Ohio's way now out of reach, the Bobcat women made a 13-0 run that spoke to the team's character during the first round of the NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament in Tempe, Arizona, Saturday afternoon. Arizona State was held without a bucket for seven minutes late in the second half as the Bobcats went from 29 points down to only 16. Ohio ended up losing 74-55, ending the ’Cats storybook season at a spectacular 27 wins. “They have a resolve about them and a high level of toughness they’ve shown throughout the year,” Ohio coach Bob Boldon told the Bobcats radio broadcast after the game. Having traveled three time zones and 1,700 miles to play the Associated Press-anointed ninth best team in the country at their home stadium, the ’Cats effort never lapsed. It didn’t help any that Sun Devil fans unveil their “curtain of distraction” during opposing players’ foul shots to, well, distract them. The curtain opens to reveal all manner of zany and outrageous characters. Alas, Ohio’s offense and defense never showed up against Arizona State in the loss on Saturday. Ohio had 18 turnovers that the Sun Devils turned into 20 points, the Bobcats probable victims of nerves, Arizona State's press and/or tempered expectations. No 14-seeded team in the NCAA Women's Tournament has ever beaten a three seed; 14 seeds entered this year winless with 84 losses. And the Sun Devils, a team allowing fewer than 56 points per game, proved a tough first-round draw, too comfortable on their home turf to have that streak snapped. “When you play a team as good as Arizona State, your margin of error gets pretty small,” Boldon said. “We just made way too many errors offensively and defensively.” All season the Ohio women's team lived by the three-pointer, but shooting 25 percent from long range Saturday in the central Arizona desert meant that the Bobcats' season was terminated by threes. Ohio's turnover troubles With Kiyanna Black in foul trouble from the time she picked up her second foul less than 90 seconds into the game, Ohio's leading scorer on the year struggled to make an impact. She scored only two points in the first half, and picked up her fourth foul with 16 minutes left to play, which hamstrung the Bobcats' offensive spark. The Ohio defense, imposing through the MAC Tournament, was no match for the balanced scoring attack of the Sun Devils. Katie Hempen, the second-leading scorer on Arizona State, was locked in from downtown throughout Saturday's contest and scored 23 to pace the Sun Devils. The ’Cats gave up 30 more points than they did in the MAC Tournament championship game. The Ohio offense, which was colder in recent games than it had been through much of the season, never found its footing. Leading scorer Black didn't make a field goal through the first 30 minutes of Saturday's game, which was a lot like a swordsman dueling without a weapon. “I think KB Black was a little slowed by the foul trouble, wasn’t quite as aggressive as she wanted to be,” Boldon said. “They did a good job of guarding her.” Ohio's dream turnaround ended with 27 wins, a total that goes into the books as the best ever in Ohio women's history. The team's MAC Tournament championship was the first since 1986, the NCAA tournament appearance Ohio's first berth since 1995. Two years ago the Bobcats went 6-23. Last season, Boldon's first, yielded just nine wins. This year was a marked departure from the slew of seasons during which the team was mediocre or worse. “This team was able to accomplish a lot of things with not-really-high expectations from people outside of this program,” Boldon said. What he learned in the process of the overhaul was that with the right roster of dedicated athletes, a weakness can be turned into a strength. In the 2013-2014 season the Bobcats were the worst-shooting team in the MAC, while this year Ohio set a program record for made three-pointers. I learned that shooting is a skill that you can improve,” the MAC Coach of the Year said. “We dedicated the fall and the spring and the summer to getting better at that skill.” Ohio's most consistent shooter was senior Mariah Byard, the only player who graduates from the squad. Though she excelled mostly on spot-up shots, making 37 percent of three-pointers on the year, Boldon said Byard will be missed as much for her intangibles as her on-the-court performance. “She’s everything a student-athlete should be,” Boldon said. “There’s just a lot of small things and big things about her game and her personality that we will miss that’s going to go far beyond her three-pointers… We’ll miss Mariah more than people think.” For a championship squad to lose only one player to graduation, there's a lot to look forward to for next year. Black, who still managed 12 points Saturday and raked in accolades including a spot on the All-MAC first team and the MAC team of the tournament, will be back. Second-leading scorer Quiera Lampkins, productive forward Lexie Baldwin, and the rest of Ohio's squad will return to defend their crown, having been exposed to competition beyond the conference. “We got a taste of the next level,” Boldon said of qualifying for his first Division 1 tournament as a coach. But while there's plenty to take away from this successful campaign, a loss is still going to sting. Even if the ’Cats were long shots, they believed in themselves all season long: nobody saw success coming outside of the program. With that kind of mentality, it's easy to see how the Bobcats never quit, though the result seemed to be a foregone conclusion. “It’s hard to get past this ballgame at the moment. I feel like we failed today and that’s hard to swallow,” Boldon said. “It’s a frustrating way to end what I thought was a pretty good year.”   </text>

<title>Tough tourney draw sends 14-seed Ohio to ArizonaTough tourney draw sends 14-seed Ohio to Arizona</title>
<text>Home / Articles / News / Sports NEWS /  Tough tourney draw sends 14-seed Ohio to Arizona . . . . . . . Tough tourney draw sends 14-seed Ohio to Arizona Bobcat women meet Arizona State Saturday By Matt Lardner Photo Caption: As soon as Monday, two days after the Ohio University women’s basketball team won the MAC championship game, T-shirts honoring the team appeared in local shops, including this one in the College Book Store. Two days after winning the MAC tournament for the first time since 1986, Bobcat women's basketball has a long way to travel just to make it to the team's first-round destination: Tempe, Arizona. Ohio 27-4, 16-2 MAC heads west with the chance to become the first Bobcat women's team to win a game in the NCAA tournament. But the Bobcats' opponent in Tempe doesn't have to travel nearly 1,700 miles. In fact, Arizona State is playing in its own home arena. Even more ominous than the disadvantage of playing against a team staying home for the opening rounds of the tournament is the advantage over the years that third-seeded teams have over 14 seeds. The favorite in that matchup has won 84 times and never lost, an impeccable record the 'Cats will try to pockmark Saturday. But despite a tough opponent, travel schedule and low seed, the Bobcats are happy to be in the tournament for the first time in 20 years. "It's exciting to be in the tournament," Boldon told Ohio Bobcat TV Monday after the draw. "If you're hoping for a bad team, you're in the wrong tournament." Ohio won automatic placement in the tournament on Saturday with a 60-44 win over streaking Eastern Michigan, the last team to beat the Bobcats this season. The 'Cats avenged that mid-February loss with staunch defense throughout and an offensive spike in the second half. After scoring only four points in the first half and starting Friday's semifinal two for 11 from the field, Kiyanna Black dominated in Saturday's second half. The offensive dynamo outscored the entire Eagles team 18-17 in the period. "My team stayed with me. They believed in me the whole time, whether I was making shots or not," Black said after the game. "In the second half I stepped up. I was doing the same thing as in the first half; I just happened to knock down shots." If the Bobcats have a chance in Tempe, they'll need Black scoring like she did in the second half and large portions of the year; the guard was Ohio's only first-team All-MAC selection for the regular season. Following the game, players dumped a celebratory Gatorade cooler on MAC Coach of the Year Boldon, finally getting the chance to enjoy a moment they've worked for since the offseason prior to their turnaround. "We've all been through so much, we've worked so hard, and I'm just really happy for our entire staff and players," Byard said. "We deserve this, so I'm just really thankful this happened." The 'Cats, who were 9-21 and 3-13 in the conference in Boldon's first year with the program, became the winningest team in program history after their tournament title, their 27th win of the season. "Last year it was hard to think of this success," Byard said. "At the start of this year I knew the work that we put in would pay off, so I knew that we'd be here." Byard, Black and Lexie Baldwin were named to the all-tournament squad. Getting the 14th seed was slightly below expectations, a sign the selection committee doesn't see the MAC as a high-caliber conference this season. Other deserving mid-majors got overlooked entirely. The biggest knock on the Bobcats in terms of tournament seeding is that the team hasn't been challenged by schools in power conferences. Arizona State's record 27-5, 15-3 in conference play is similar, as are its offensive-production stats. But the Sun Devils play in the PAC-12, which sent five schools to the Big Dance instead of just one, and they've played ranked opponents and tough competition throughout the season. Arizona State, ranked ninth in Associated Press polls, will be the first ranked opponent the Bobcats face all season. The Sun Devils don't have an elite scorer but six players average at least seven points per game. Forward Sophie Brunner is the team's leading scorer and rebounder, and one of Ohio's weak areas is in post play. Brunner is 6-foot-1, but Arizona State also has a 6-foot-4 center who scores at a prolific rate off the bench and could be a tough matchup for the 'Cats. One Ohio player who struggled through the tournament was guard Quiera Lampkins, who scored a combined eight points in two games after averaging 12.3 points per game this season. Lampkins is typically Black's offensive complement, a more physical, slashing guard who leads Ohio in rebounding. The team has been resilient all season and always tempered celebrations of success. After they learned that the 'Cats would be regular-season champions, Bobcat players didn't celebrate loudly but instead saw the title as a natural part of success' progression. Now, Ohio must steel itself again and hone in on playing defense against the most talented Bobcat opponent all season. A close unit whose revival has in large part been due to unity, the Bobcats gathered with the community and their team Monday at Buffalo Wild Wings in uptown Athens to find out their fate. A cheer, deserved, went up as the Bobcats learned their fate. Then it was back to work: Boldon planned to begin watching film within 20 minutes of leaving the restaurant. A team that Boldon said hasn't left the Eastern time zone in two seasons under its coach now must move three hours backward as it attempts to take a major step forward in program history. The winner of Saturday's game, set for 3:30 p.m. Arizona time 6:30 p.m. EDT/Athens time and airing on ESPN2, plays either sixth-seeded Texas A&amp;M or 11-seeded Arkansas-Little Rock on Monday.   </text>

<title>Rangers close to reacquiring outfielder Josh Hamilton from Angels - ABC News</title>
<text>Rangers close to reacquiring outfielder Josh Hamilton from Angels Apr 24, 2015, 8:02 PM ET JERRY CRASNICK via ESPN Josh Hamilton  likely is headed back to the Texas Rangers . The Los Angeles Angels are "very close" to finalizing a deal to send Hamilton to the Rangers, a baseball source confirmed to ESPN.com on Friday. Hamilton would be rejoining the franchise with which he made five straight All-Star teams and won the American League MVP award in 2010. He also helped lead the Rangers to back-to-back AL pennants in 2010 and '11. sc MLB.com earlier reported the deal, with sources telling the website a trade likely will be announced Monday after legal work between the teams is completed. The Angels owe Hamilton $83 million through 2017. Yahoo! Sports reported that the Rangers are expected to pay about $15 million, with Los Angeles paying the difference. Hamilton, 33, has been a major disappointment since signing a five-year, $125 million contract with the Angels in December 2012. He hit .255 with a .741 OPS in his first two seasons in Anaheim and has missed the start of this season with a shoulder injury. He also suffered a substance-abuse relapse during the offseason and did not report to Angels spring camp in Arizona as he rehabbed his shoulder. Three weeks ago, an arbitration panel ruled that he would not be suspended -- paving the way for him to return in May once his shoulder has healed. The Angels made it clear through their public comments that they were unhappy with the panel's decision and resistant to having the outfielder rejoin the team. General manager Jerry Dipoto said in a statement that the Angels had "serious concerns about Josh's conduct, health and behavior,'' and club president John Carpino told reporters that it "defies logic" that Hamilton wasn't suspended under MLB's drug program. Earlier this month, owner Arte Moreno said he wasn't sure whether Hamilton ever would play again for the Angels. Moreno said Hamilton's contract contained language protecting the team against a relapse by the outfielder. The Major League Baseball Players Association later denied Moreno's assertion. Angels players and coaches have supported Hamilton since his relapse. Manager Mike Scioscia and several teammates had dinner with him during the team's recent series in Houston. Even as he has struggled with the Angels the past two seasons, Hamilton still has hit well in Texas. In 70 plate appearances at Globe Life Park since 2013, he has hit .339 21-of-62. Only Seattle Mariners second baseman Kyle Seager .395 has posted a better average there over that span. The Rangers, meanwhile, could use outfield help. Their outfield ranks 29th and 28th this season in batting average .194 and OPS .576, respectively, entering Friday night.

<title>Women's Lacrosse SSC Tournament: Florida Southern Sets Sights on NCAA Tournament | TheLedger.com</title>
<text>Published: Friday, April 24, 2015 at 12:10 a.m. Last Modified: Friday, April 24, 2015 at 12:10 a.m. LAKELAND | It's been four years since Kara Reber arrived to start the Florida Southern College women's lacrosse program. In this 2012 file photo, Florida Southern College Women's Lacrosse Head Coach Kara Reber instructs her players during half time of their game against Lenoir-Rhyne College at Bryant Stadium. MICHAEL WILSON | THE LEDGER 2012 In those four years, the Mocs have had a lot of close calls when it comes to making the NCAA Division II Women's Lacrosse Tournament. It looks like that wait is over for the Moccasins. Florida Southern, which is ranked No. 5 in the nation, is also ranked No. 3 in the South Region heading into today's first Sunshine State Conference Women's Lacrosse Tournament at Bryant Stadium. It would appear that all the Mocs 18-2, 4-0 need to do is the thing they had no problem doing all season, beat SSC opponents. Florida Southern opens the tournament against Florida Tech at 6 p.m. "Our hope is if we can win the rest of our games we can get a bid to the tournament," Reber said. "I think if we play the way we know how to play then we can get these next two wins. The girls are excited about an opportunity to play in the NCAA tournament." Only the top four teams in each of the two regions get bids to the tournament, and at the moment Florida Southern is third behind Lock Haven and Lindenwood Mo.. Rollins, who is the No. 2 seed in the SSC Tournament, is No. 4 in the South Region. Rollins will play Saint Leo at 3 p.m. today at Bryant Stadium. Florida Southern had no trouble winning its four SSC games this year. The Moccasins outscored their opponents 56-19, beating Rollins 15-8, Tampa 22-7 and Florida Tech 19-4. Florida Southern also comes into the game on a nine-game winning streak, with its last loss coming on the road at Lindenwood, 9-8. "I'm really happy for the senior class," Reber said. "They're the ones that started the program and made it what it is today. I hope they get rewarded to play in the tournament." That senior class is led by Megan Asper, Caitlin Chase and Lorianne Hoover on offense. Asper has scored 61 goals this year and has 23 assists for 81 total points. That puts her third in Division II in goals scored, just two behind Grand Valley State's Erika Neuman. Chase has 34 goals and 54 assists to give her 88 total points. That ranks her third in the country, two spots ahead of Asper. Hoover is balanced in both scoring categories, racking up 45 goals and 34 assists. She is seventh in the nation in total points with 79. Defensively, the Mocs have had a strong year from freshman goalkeeper Ashley Seborowski. She has started 16 games this year and has a 55.9 save percentage. Seborowski is second in the nation in that category, trailing West Virginia Wesleyan's Lexi Swisher with a 56.7 save percentage. [ Reach Ray Beasock at ray.beasock@theledger.com or 863-802-7537.

<text>NBA Roundup: James Scores 31 to Give Cavaliers 3-0 Series Lead THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: Friday, April 24, 2015 at 1:31 a.m. Last Modified: Friday, April 24, 2015 at 1:31 a.m. BOSTON | LeBron James scored 31 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers moved one win away from a sweep in their first playoff series in five years with a 103-95 victory over the Boston Celtics on Thursday night. The scrappy Celtics kept it close, just as they did in the previous two games, and trailed 95-92 after Evan Turner hit a 3-pointer with 2:45 left. But Kevin Love hit two 3-pointers for a 101-93 lead with 26 seconds to go. Cleveland can complete the sweep of the best-of-seven, first-round series Sunday in Boston. No NBA team has won a series after trailing 3-0. Turner had 19 points and Avery Bradley added 18 while Isaiah Thomas managed just five points after scoring 22 in the first two games. Love had 23 points and J.R. Smith added 15 for the Cavaliers. Warriors 123, Pelicans 119 NEW ORLEANS | Stephen Curry scored 40 points, including a 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation to complete a 20-point, fourth-quarter comeback, and Golden State beat New Orleans 123-119 in overtime Thursday night to take a 3-0 lead in their first-round playoff series. Curry hit seven 3s in all, including one to start overtime that gave the Warriors the lead for good. Klay Thompson had 28 points for the Warriors, who trailed 89-69 after three quarters, then outscored New Orleans 39-19 over the next 12 minutes. Anthony Davis had 29 points and 15 rebounds for the Pelicans, but his missed free throw with 9.6 seconds left — as the crowd chanted "M-V-P!" — allowed Curry's late 3 to tie it. Davis had a chance to tie it in the final seconds of overtime, but Warriors center Andrew Bogut forced him into a difficult driving shot, which missed badly. The Warriors go for the sweep on Saturday in New Orleans. No NBA team has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit to win a playoff series. Bulls 113, Bucks 106, 2 OTs MILWAUKEE | Derrick Rose scored 34 points and Jimmy Butler added 24 as Chicago took a 3-0 lead in the Eastern Conference playoff series. Butler's steal and layup started an 8-0 run that gave Chicago a 109-101 lead with 2:44 left in the second overtime. Rose scored six points in the second overtime, including a layup off an offensive rebound with 2:15 left for a 10-point lead. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 25 points and Khris Middleton added 18 for Milwaukee, which went scoreless for more than 6 minutes in the first and second overtimes. The Bulls will go for the sweep on Saturday in Milwaukee. No NBA team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a series.

<text>Embed Email Though there are numerous ultramarathons, competitions that exceed running or walking the traditional 26.2 miles, very few compare to The Barkley Marathons. The annual 100-mile race that challenges participants both mentally and physically has been completed by only 14 of the 1,100 total participants in its 30-year history. To put it in perspective, that is just two more than the number of people that have walked on the moon! Held annually in Wartburg, Tennessee's Frozen Head State Park, the competition that takes place in late March or early April is the brainchild of ultrarunner Gary Cantrell. The ex-elite runner says his inspiration for the race came from James Earl Ray, the man accused of assassinating Martin Luther King Jr.  In 1977, Ray escaped from the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary at the foot of Frozen Head State Park. When captured 55 hours later, he had managed to cover a distance of just 8.5 miles thanks to the treacherous terrain. Cantrell decided to raise the bar with a course that consists of a 20-mile loop that runners need to complete five times in 60 hours. In order to compete for the coveted 35-40 spots, candidates have to not only prove their fitness but also write an essay on why they should be allowed to run. Then they have to do some investigative work on where to send the application; a difficult task given that the location is a closely guarded secret. Also, the applications have to get to Cantrell at midnight on Christmas day. Even a five-minute delay could result in disqualification. Things don’t get any easier for the competitors that get accepted. That’s because the course, which changes annually, is revealed the day prior to the race, making any training impossible. The only thing contestants know for sure is that it will include the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary tunnel from where James Earl Ray escaped. The actual start time of the 100-mile race is also shrouded in mystery. Runners set up camp at the Frozen Head State Park on Friday and then wait for the sound of Cantrell's conch shell which alerts them that the race will commence in an hour. Since the horn can sound anytime between midnight to noon on Saturday, they have to be alert at all times. The oddities continue even when its time to race. Instead of signaling the start of the race with a starter pistol, Cantrell opts for a lighter and cigarette. The race itself must be completed in 60 hours or less, and no more than 12 hours can be spent completing each loop. Also, while the runner can choose his/her direction during the first, second, and final 20-mile loop, the third and fourth loops have to be run in opposite directions. In addition to the treacherous terrain, contestants also have to contend with the elevation. Cantrell estimates that during the five laps, contestants will climb approximately 62,000 feet - the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest twice! And if that is not stressful enough, there are only two fixed water-refilling locations and no medical personnel available to aid those in distress. Cantrell also forbids the use of GPS tracking devices or cell phones. Instead, participants have to find their way amidst the unmarked trails using a map and compass. In order to prove they completed the course, runners have to seek out books placed along the course and tear out the pages that correspond to their race numbers. Those that fail to do so are immediately disqualified. However, if you think that all these hurdles deter participants, think again. Cantrell receives in excess of 200 applications each year, many from some of the world's best athletes. It is no wonder that the slots are filled up within five minutes after the official opening. This year was no exception. 40 competitors, including a record nine women set out to complete this crazy race the weekend of March 28th, 2015. However, there were no winners. John Kelly, a 30-year-old electrical engineer, made it the farthest by successfully conquering three of the five loops in the given time. Others weren't as lucky. One passed out on the ground after running 48 miles in 28 hours. Another was deemed lost when he failed to show up seven hours after the time limit for the race had passed. Just as a search party was being organized, he strolled in telling organizers that sheer exhaustion had caused him to take an eight-hour nap atop the mountain! Despite these horror stories, most plan to endure this mental and physical ordeal at least one more time and see if they can be amongst the few able to complete the world's toughest race.

<title>Drive for diversity: NASCAR racers break boundaries - CNN.com</title>
<text>CNN Profiles A-Z           Driving for diversity: The NASCAR racers breaking boundaries By Susie East Updated 1512 GMT 2212 HKT April 24, 2015 Meet the racers 8 photos Kenzie Ruston used to play soccer, basketball and was even a cheerleader before specializing in NASCAR racing. Hide Caption 1 of 8 Meet the racers 8 photos The 23-year-old was a late starter, participating in her first race at 14 -- but quickly moved up the ranks, winning seven championship titles in 2009. Hide Caption 2 of 8 Meet the racers 8 photos "There's a bunch of fans out there when you go to tracks that just cheer for the girl because there's not that many of us," Ruston told CNN. Hide Caption 3 of 8 Meet the racers 8 photos Here Ruston #96 is pictured driving in the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series at Iowa Speedway. Hide Caption Meet the racers 8 photos Dylan Smith began racing in a Kid Kart when he was four years old. Hide Caption 5 of 8 Meet the racers 8 photos In 2009, Smith won Rookie of the Year honors in the Touring Late Model division at Thunder Road Speedbowl. He also participated in his first Drive For Diversity Combine. Hide Caption 6 of 8 Meet the racers 8 photos "I've been trying to break into this exact team and this program for the last six years, so to come and drive for them is really a dream come true," Smith said of the Drive For Diversity team. Hide Caption 7 of 8 Meet the racers 8 photos Drivers form a team huddle before going out on their track activities during the 2012 NASCAR Drive For Diversity Combine at Langley Speedway, Virginia. Hide Caption CNN Winning is everything, and for some it means making history. In America's biggest motorsport, women and ethnic minorities are smashing barriers in their pursuit of NASCAR glory -- traditionally dominated by white men behind the wheel. Female driver Kenzie Ruston and African-American driver Dylan Smith were selected to join Rev Racing's Drive for Diversity D4D team, which gives talented drivers from diverse backgrounds an opportunity to compete. 'I've beaten a lot of guys driving like a girl' Ruston is nothing short of competitive -- and the Oklahoma-born 23-year-old has to be if she wants to make it big in a high-octane sport that sees racers battle it out on oval tracks for hours at a time in front of delirious fans. Sneak peak of yesterdays photoshoot with the family... S/O to Scott Hunter #Fresh #squadgoals #RevRacing #Nascar pic.twitter.com/8pfpxrMiqg — Black Mamba @DylanSmith34 March 5, 2015 While Danica Patrick is one of the most famous female drivers on the circuit -- winning a historic pole position in the 2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series -- no woman has ever won an official NASCAR race. All the more motivation for Ruston. "I think there's like 40 women that have come up through the NASCAR ranks. None of us have ever won a race yet but it's going to happen pretty soon," Ruston told CNN. "It's going to be a woman someday and I just hope it's me." Ruston grew up around racing, spending her summer weekends scraping mud off her step grandfather's car -- he was also an avid racer. "He's passed now, but he was definitely a huge inspiration, a huge supporter. Every time at the race track, even if I came second he'd say, 'Why didn't you win' He was really funny -- that was the only question, every weekend." Several years and a bunch of records later, Ruston is making waves in North Carolina after being selected for Rev Racing's 2015 Drive for Diversity team. — Kenzie Ruston @KenzieRuston January 26, 2015 The program provides training, support and equipment, giving a boost to drivers like Ruston who don't always fit the traditional NASCAR image. "I mean it's basically white males in this sport, there's not many females, there's not many Hispanics, there's not many African-Americans, so I think it's really cool what they're trying to accomplish," Ruston explained. "Being a woman is still hard these days, I mean a lot of men think women shouldn't do a lot of things. If someone says you can't do it, use that fight to keep going. Any time someone says you can't do it that should just give you even more desire to achieve it." Ruston is eager to prove that girls can be just as successful as guys in racing, and is a huge fan of the viral "Like A Girl" video by feminine hygiene company Always, explaining how it inspires her to race harder. When people watch this film, it changes their perspective on what #LikeAGirl means. Run as fast as you can &amp; share!  — Always @Always February 2, 2015 "I watch it all the time, I still watch it all the time. It puts fire underneath me, like yeah I'm going to show these guys that being a girl is not a bad thing." Last year Ruston became the highest finishing female in the K&amp;N Pro Series East when she finished second at the Iowa Speedway for Ben Kennedy Racing. In the first race of this season she came 10th out of 29 drivers. 'Black Mamba' Dylan Smith is another driver who wants to prove himself in NASCAR, having finally made the D4D team after six years of trying. His dad originally wanted him to be a golfer but the 22-year-old found driving 3,300-pound cars at high speeds slightly more to his taste. Nicknamed "Black Mamba," Smith competes in a Late Model Stock Car in the Whelen All American Series . He finished eighth in his first race this season. Easily recognized by his '80s high-top haircut and warm infectious personality, as a young black man Smith strives to be a leader for others. A photo posted by Dylan Smith @dylansmith34 on Mar 12, 2015 at 9:47am PDT "There are people of different ethnicities in NASCAR, you just don't see them at the forefront, so now it's time to get some traction," Smith told CNN. When asked if he'd ever experienced racism on the track the answer was a resounding no. "I think it's funny that people associate NASCAR so much with racism," he said. "I think there's less of it in NASCAR than people really know. There's a lot of fans that pull for me and pull for other drivers of different ethnicities and genders, and it's truly awesome to see that. "I've got into altercations with people on the track but I've never thought for one minute that it was because of the color of my skin." Things have progressed from when Smith's hero Wendell Scott was racing in the '50s and '60s. The first African-American to win a race in the Grand National Series, Scott was a pioneer for black drivers, pursuing greatness in the face of death threats, sabotage from other drivers, and officials who initially awarded a win to a white driver two laps behind. I can't thank the . @NASCARHall enough for jumping on this weekend! It means so much to me. #BlackHistoryMonth #Nascar pic.twitter.com/Goa1tOZKhO — Black Mamba @DylanSmith34 February 16, 2015 This year he was posthumously inducted to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, cementing his reputation as a barrier-breaking driver. "Without him going through everything he went through, I'm not 100% sure I'd be in the situation I am in with Rev Racing," Smith said of Scott. "If he can push through, and get through all the negativity and junk that he went through then with all the support that I have I absolutely think that I can make it too." Now the legacy continues as drivers like Ruston and Smith make their mark on the track -- not only for themselves, but to inspire generations to come. "This is what the sport needs to bring more fans in, this is what NASCAR needs -- a variety of people," said Ruston.</text>

Hide Caption 3 of 6 Real deal 6 photos Simeone's last stand – Diego Simeone, the Atletico Madrid manager, led his team to the Champions League final last season where it was beaten 4-1 by Real Madrid.

The Italian team claimed a goalless draw on the night to progress Hide Caption CNN Better late than never. Real Madrid secured its place in the semifinals of the Champions League after claiming a dramatic 1-0 victory over city rival Atletico Madrid. Javier Hernandez, the forward who had missed a host of chances throughout the evening, netted an 88th minute winner to settle a tetchy and often uninspiring tie. Real, the 10-time winner, recorded their first victory of the season in eight attempts against an Atletico side which was reduced to 10-men in the closing stages. Arda Turan, the Turkish midfielder, was shown a second yellow card for a tackle on Sergio Ramos, and was forced to leave the field with 14 minutes remaining. After a goalless first leg, this was always likely to be a tense contest and so it proved. Real, which dominated for long periods and created the better chances, finally found a way through a stubborn Atletico defense courtesy of Hernandez's finish. FT: Real Madrid 1 - 0 Atlético de Madrid Chicharito, 87'. TO THE SEMIS!!!! #JuntosAPorLaUndecima pic.twitter.com/5b1lQYhcf9 — Real Madrid C.F. @realmadriden April 22, 2015 Familiarity breeds contempt so the saying goes and this meeting -- the eighth between the teams since last season's final was full of the kind of physicality which has become synonymous with such occasions. Since last season's final, which Real won 4-1 after entering the 90th minute of the contest a goal adrift, the reigning champion has endured a dismal record against its neighbor. Of the seven previous meetings, Real had failed to muster a single victory, losing three occasions and managing to draw on four. Last week, Real was denied victory by the heroics of Jan Oblak, the Atletico goalkeeper. His performance, which frustrated the visiting side, allowed Atletico to dream of redemption. It was a task which should have made Atletico's task ostensibly easier given Real's injury problems. Luka Modric, outstanding since his return from injury, was ruled until the end of the season after suffering knee ligament damage during the recent victory over Malaga. Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, two of the three components of the much vaunted 'BBC' were both forced to watch from the sidelines after sustaining injuries, while Marcelo missed out through suspension. — Champions League @ChampionsLeague April 22, 2015 While chances were few in the opening period, it was Real which looked the more threatening of the two and Oblak produced a fine save to deny Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo, the first player in Spanish football to score 50 goals in five successive seasons, was gifted a golden opportunity to fire his side ahead just before the interval. A mistake in the Atletico midfield allowed Real to gather possession and when the ball was passed into Ronaldo's feet, the Portuguese unleashed a fierce effort which Oblak blocked. Real, with Hernandez deputizing for Benzema at the center of the attack, should have moved ahead almost immediately after the break. Isco, who was afforded both time and space, picked the perfect pass to dissect the Atletico defense but Hernandez somehow managed to steer his effort wide of the far post. Real, second in La Liga and two points behind leader Barcelona, continued to look the more likely to break the deadlock with Ronaldo bringing yet another save out of the impressive Oblak. Its second half dominance was given added impetus with 14 minutes remaining when Arda Turan, the Atletico midfielder, was dismissed after picking up a second yellow card. FINAL | 1-0 | Falling down and standing up again is just a part of the journey. It could not be this season, but we'll be back. #GoAtleti — Atleti English @atletienglish April 22, 2015 Buoyed by its numerical advantage, Real pressed forward in search of the breakthrough and Hernandez wasted yet another opportunity by firing wide when through on goal. But with the tie appearing set to enter extra time, the forward, on-loan from Manchester United, rolled home a dramatic winner to break Atletico hearts. "Tonight we played a good game, we had good control," said Carlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid manager, whose side is attempting to become the first team in history to successfully defend the Champions League title. "We didn't give them a chance to counter attack. "We found the right solution in the last minutes. Of course the sending off made a difference, I don't know if it was right or not." Speaking to Sky Sports, he added: "It was a game with intensity but the players showed good fair play. "Javier Hernandez was fantastic. He played really well and he deserved the goal. "He hasn't played a lot this season but when I needed him he was ready. He is a real professional." — JuventusFC @juventusfcen April 22, 2015 Juventus through Juventus qualified for the last four of the competition for the first time since 2003 after defeating Monaco 1-0 on aggregate. Leading courtesy of Arturo Vidal's penalty in the first leg, Juventus ensured their place in the semifinals with a disciplined display. Andrea Pirlo, the iconic midfielder, hit the crossbar with a late free kick as the visitors came close to breaking the deadlock. "I thought I'd have to wait less than 12 years to reach a Champions League semifinal," said Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. "We wanted to get through at all costs." It joins Bayern Munich and Barcelona in the draw which will take place on Friday. </text>

<title>Robobarista Can Learn How To Operate Your Coffee Machine | Popular Science</title>
<text>Robobarista Can Learn How To Operate Your Coffee Machine But can it make a half-caff venti non-fat caramel macchiato, extra foam By Dan Moren posted Apr 23rd, 2015 at 9:00am 0 Robobarista Cornell University When you get a new coffee machine, you can probably figure out how to use it. But how does your robot know You know, that one you have lying around. The Robot Learning Lab at Cornell University has a solution: a robot that can learn how to operate new machines. The Robobarista, as the project is called, uses a "deep learning neural network" to figure out how different controls on a gadget work. Overall, it's actually pretty close to how humans learn. For one thing, the robot consults instruction manuals for the device in question, which are often available online. Secondly, it has a database of how to interact with and use certain types of controls, assembled via a crowdsourced method, using a combination of Amazon's Mechanical Turk and volunteers who show the robot how to perform a particular task using an interactive 3D model in a web browser. Thus, when the robot is confronted by a control it finds familiar--say, a knob--it can first try to recognize it by comparing it to all the known objects in its database. Then, once it's determined that said control is a knob, it can extrapolate how to physically operate it, based on all the knobs in its database and how people have demonstrated using them. Similar projects in the past have utilized crowdsourced knowledge to help robots figure out how to grab certain items or even build shapes with blocks , the latter using the same PR2 robot as the Robobarista project. Because this learning method is so broad, it means that the Robobarista is able to interact with far more than just coffee makers; it can learn how to use everything from juicers to bathroom sinks. So rather than dedicated robots who only know how to do a single thing, you could have one robot that handles many different household tasks. But no matter how good your robot gets at running the dishwasher or squeezing juice, it'll probably be a little while before it learns how to make all that great latte art .

<title>Google Wants To Be Your Wireless Carrier | Popular Science</title>
<text>Google Wants To Be Your Wireless Carrier The service would let phones jump between Wi-Fi and 4G By Dan Moren posted Apr 22nd, 2015 at 6:30pm 0 Google Google's been many things to many people: search engine, email service, social network. Now the folks from Mountain View are branching out into a brand-new arena by launching a mobile phone carrier, Project Fi . The cell phone market might seem like a strange move for Google, but keep in mind that the company has also been expanding its broadband efforts via Google Fiber . As in that case, Google is offering a few things that set it apart from the competition. For one, it's using towers from two separate wireless carriers, T-Mobile and Sprint, combined with a database of free, open Wi-Fi hotspots for both data and voice connections. Thus, at any given moment, your phone could choose from up to three possible networks, selecting the fastest one. It'll even encrypt your connection to Wi-Fi hotspots using a Virtual Private Network VPN to help evade snooping by others. The other two major selling points of Project Fi are free international data without roaming charges in more than 120 countries though only at slower 3G speeds, and the promise that, unlike most other carriers, Google will only end up charging you for the amount of data you actually use, offering a credit for unused data on your following month's bill. Before you jump ship to Google's offering, however, there are a couple of things you should know. For one, it's currently on an invite-only basis, and only available to users of Google's Nexus 6 phone. Why might Google want to join the wireless carrier fray For one, most people are increasingly dissatisfied with their mobile phone carriers . But perhaps the biggest advantage is simply getting more people connected to better networks more frequently. The more and easier that people can be online, the more they can rely on the other services Google has to offer--which themselves help drive Google's core money maker: building profiles of its users and advertising to them.

<text>This Security Flaw Can Cause Your iPhone To Reboot Endlessly That innocent-looking Wi-Fi network may be a wolf in sheep's clothing By Dan Moren posted Apr 22nd, 2015 at 4:30pm 0 iPhone 5s Kelvinsong, Wikimedia Commons While iOS devices may generally suffer less from malware than competing smartphone platforms, that doesn't mean there aren't security risks. At this week's RSA security conference , researchers demonstrated a flaw that allows a maliciously configured Wi-Fi access point to crash an iPhone --without the phone even joining that network. Yair Amit of security firm Skycure, along with a pair of his colleagues, discovered that iOS devices were crashing when trying to connect to a new router. After some investigation they concluded that the problem lay in Secure Sockets Layer SSL, the system that underlies secure web communication. With a specially crafted cryptographic certificate, a bug could be triggered which causes the iPhone to crash whenever an app attempts an encrypted web connection--something that many apps do in order to maintain security. In certain circumstances, Amit and his team were able to cause an iPhone to go into an endless cycle of reboots, rendering it essentially unusable. While it might seem like the simple answer here is not to connect to unknown Wi-Fi access points--good common-sense advice in general--Skycure's researchers found a way to exploit the vulnerability without users explicitly telling their devices to join a network. To do so, they used a second exploit they'd discovered back in 2013 , where devices that run on certain mobile phone carriers are pre-configured to join carrier-specific Wi-Fi networks. For example, in the US, AT&amp;T allows subscribers to use its 'attwifi' network for free; other carriers like Bell in Canada, SingTel in Singapore, Swisscom in Switzerland, and so on have similar set ups. These Wi-Fi network names are stored in the operating system itself, and can't be directly accessed or edited by users. So simply naming a router's network 'attwifi' will force iOS devices running on AT&amp;T's network to try and connect to the network automatically--thus potentially triggering the reboot bug. The bug doesn’t do any permanent damage, but it is effectively a cheap--albeit somewhat limited--cell phone jammer. Skycure says it's submitted the vulnerability to Apple and is working with the company to fix it. They haven't published the full information about the exploit to prevent it being used in the wild.

<title>Forget Text Messages--Send Emotions Over The Air | Popular Science</title>
<text>Forget Text Messages--Send Emotions Over The Air Technology gets the touchy-feelies By Dan Moren posted Apr 21st, 2015 at 5:30pm 0 Ultrahaptics It used to be the case that if you wanted to reach out and touch someone, you had to use your hands. But thanks to scientists in the U.K. , you might some day be able to use technology--and no, we're not talking the telephone--to transmit the emotions you experience to someone else via touch. A study conducted by Dr. Marianna Obrist at the University of Sussex has established that touches to certain parts of the hand tend to be interpreted as specific emotions. For example, contact to the outer part of the hand is generally seen as negative; unhappy emotions are triggered by touches to the area around the pinky, while tactile sensations in the index figure are more positive. Obrist's study did not, however, show a physiological reaction from the touches. Obrist used a system to test the emotional impact of the study’s participants called Ultrahaptics , which uses directed bursts of air to trigger those emotions via haptic--or touch-based--feedback. Though the UltraHaptics device is bulky and sits on a desk, the researchers envision a day when the same end result could be accomplished by a bracelet worn on one's wrist. It's hardly a far-fetched idea, especially given the current intense interest around both haptics and wearable technology. Take the soon-to-debut Apple Watch, which uses a specialized Taptic Engine to deliver silent notifications that feel like someone is tapping you on the wrist. The Watch can also be used to send one's heartbeat to a friend or loved one, which they then experience as a series of taps on the wrist. Granted, in many cases that might seem too intimate, and it potentially conveys fewer distinct emotions than Obrist's system. Beyond just the ability to communicate emotions between two people, the Sussex researchers also propose the idea of a one-to-many relationship where, say, a performer could 'send' emotions to audience members who raise their hands into the air though probably not like they just don't care.

<title>Creepy Robot That Imitates Facial Expressions May Soon Greet You At Hotels | Popular Science</title>
<text>Creepy Robot That Imitates Facial Expressions May Soon Greet You At Hotels A face only a robot mother could love By Dan Moren posted Apr 21st, 2015 at 3:15pm 0 Reuters Humanoid robots like Star Trek's data have long been the stuff of science-fiction, but if Hanson Robotics's latest foray into a person-like artificial being is any indication, that day may be...well, still pretty far off. 'Han,' as the robot is dubbed, features 40 motors that allow its face to demonstrate a range of emotions and facial expressions: everything from smiling and flirting to crossing its eyes or acting drunk. Cameras in the robot's eyes and chest allow it to determine the age and gender of the person it's talking to, and it features the ability to carry out limited conversations too. Hanson Robotics says it's targeting applications such as working behind the desk at a hotel or interacting with the elderly. But just looking at the robot, I think the company might want to invest a little more time. To me, Han seems to rest squarely in the Uncanny Valley , the point at which people are put off by something that is purporting to be human but clearly isn't. Part of that is Han's layer of skin, made out of a substance called 'Frubber'—short for 'Flesh Rubber'—which looks remarkably lifelike enough that it veers into the creepy. But its conversational skills also seem more stilted than something like Siri or Amazon's Alexa, answering some statements with vague non-sequiturs. And I'm not quite sure that flirting or acting drunk is going to be of particular use in either the health care or customer service fields. Like we don't all have enough frustration dealing with customer service chatbots as it is. Han, however, isn't the version that Hanson is aiming to commercialize. It'll instead use the face-expression technology from Han in a female robotic face named 'Eva.' Hopefully that one will be a little less off-putting, so that we don't end up with a mass of terrified hotel customers. </text>

<title>3D-Printed Bottle Used In Murder Trial | Popular Science</title>
<text>3D-Printed Bottle Used In Murder Trial A replica of a deadly weapon helps justice to be served By Kelsey D. Atherton posted Apr 21st, 2015 at 9:45am 0 City College Plymouth In the wee hours of June 6th, 2014, two men lined up to summon a taxi. One was a 42-year-old father of three named Lee Dent, who ran a used tire shop and had been out drinking. The other was 17-year-old youth soccer player Alex Peguero Sosa, who was planning to attend university. An altercation ensued, a bottle broken, and at the end of it, Peguero Sosa was dead, stabbed in the neck by the broken bottle. Dent claims that he did not realize he was holding a bottle when the conflict ensued. To analyze whether the stabbing was intentional, the prosecution wanted to see how Dent held the bottle. Only one complication: At what point in the trial is it wise to hand an accused murderer the weapon used for the crime Instead, the prosecution asked nearby City College Plymouth to print a replica of the murder weapon. Because the 3D-printed version was intact and plastic, it allowed the court to safely see how exactly Dent had wielded the weapon without handing him another deadly weapon. At the trial, Dent plead not guilty to the murder. After a two-week trial and eight hours of deliberation , the jury rejected Dent's version of events. Dent was sentenced to 22 years for the murder of Alex Peguero Sosa. </text>

<title>Are Technology Companies Ripe for Disruption? — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>08 Apr 2015  What Do YOU Think Are Technology Companies Ripe for Disruption Today's tech products, says James Heskett, seem increasingly stuffed full of features most users don't want—kindling for igniting Clayton Christensen's disruptive innovation. Is information technology the next industry to be disrupted What do YOU think   by James Heskett I ask myself why I understand so little of the policy issues, product discussions, and even general news coming out of the tech world. That's my problem. I need to fix it by doing what Jack Welch asked all of his senior colleagues at GE to do: find a mentor no older than 30 to help me update my tech skills and knowledge. Is it my imagination, or has the world of information technology become so inbred that it is losing touch with users, particularly those of a certain age If it's not my imagination, that's the tech world's problem and opportunity. At the risk of employing the most overused and misused term of the decade, are the masters of disruption themselves providing attractive opportunities to those who would disrupt them Clay Christensen's original concept of disruption is very simple. It concerns the successful development of products and simple solutions with less functionality and much lower prices than competitors locked into a product development strategy calling for growth through product obsolescence and more and more largely unused but expensive bells and whistles. We're told that the typical user of information technology today utilizes less than 5 percent of the capability made available by today's hardware and software. A small number of basic functions repeatedly are put to good use by the typical user. They are the need-to-have functions. The functions thought by designers to be nice to have may enhance marketing efforts and satisfy software engineers' desires to make complex things, but they largely go unused. For some, they even make access to "need to have" functions more confusing. How has this come to pass Is it that much of the information technology we confront these days is the output of a small group of entrepreneurs, engineers, and venture capitalists located in close proximity to one another, frequenting the same restaurants, and speaking a language of their own They represent a classic "cluster" from the world of competitive strategy. But are they denied exposure to consumers who are different from them in age, educational background, technological sophistication, and, as claimed in a recent, well publicized lawsuit, gender My inspiration for these rants is Scott Cook HBS MBA '76, co-founder of Intuit and a true disruptor. From its founding Intuit, quickly became the leading producer of personal and small-business financial software. It did it by providing simple and inexpensive solutions to everyday problems. Initially it solved a problem in Scott's family of balancing the checkbook. Intuit is said to have been the 47th software company to address the problem. It did it by using as a metaphor the familiar checks and checkbooks that could be manipulated in non-threatening ways on a computer screen. Scott likes to say that Intuit had 47th mover advantage, in part because it adopted a strategy that identified the pencil as the company's most important competitor. As a result, Intuit has dominated markets and badly beaten Microsoft at the personal finance software game. And it has done so by hiring software engineers that are hard to find in Silicon Valley—those who actually like to design products that are simpler than those of competitors. Cook's company disrupted its industry. This prompts several questions. Are information technology companies subject to the same kinds of blinkered strategies experienced in more traditional industries Has there been sufficient effort to disrupt them Or are my perceptions those of a generationally handicapped and challenged observer Is it time for more disruption in infotech If so, what will it take to achieve it What do you think To read more: </text>

<title>Scholars and Students Unpack the Digital Business Revolution — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>25 Feb 2015  Lessons from the Classroom Scholars and Students Unpack the Digital Business Revolution Harvard Business School's Digital Initiative, led by professors Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani, brings an interdisciplinary approach to studying how digital technology has transformed business and innovation.   by Julia Hanna Think of Harvard Business School's recently launched the Digital Initiative D/I as a giant laboratory, where leading scholars and practitioners convene to research, teach, and put into practice new understandings about the relentless digital transformation of business. Launched in 2013, D/I focuses on the economics and strategy of digital: how organizations need to adapt and change in this new environment, and the individual skills required to succeed in a digital economy. "You know that a significant change has taken place when you can have the same conversation with an analyst at a hedge fund, an Amazon employee focused on retail data, and a forecaster at General Electric," says HBS David Sarnoff Professor of Business Administration Marco Iansiti , who serves as faculty chair of the initiative and head of the Technology and Operations Management unit. D/I is one of 13 initiatives and projects created by the School to foster interdisciplinary research on the great problems and opportunities facing society—including such topics as business and the environment, health care, US competitiveness, social enterprise, and leadership. Driving Forces For businesess, the transformation to digital is being driven by two primary factors, according to Iansiti: the explosion of connected devices and expanded computing capacity in the cloud. The study of innovation and business is still in its infancy. ©iStock.com/RichVintage From a research perspective, more of the scholars HBS is attracting are studying digital, says Associate Professor Karim R. Lakhani , a member of D/I'sw faculty who also serves as principal investigator of the Crowd Innovation Lab at Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science. "The Digital Initiative gives us the space to collaborate and build a scholarly community that reflects what is happening in the broader world while creating new learning materials for students and practitioners." Iansiti and Lakhani's MBA elective course Digital Innovation and Transformation is a direct reflection of the organizing impetus behind D/I. In it, students get a hands-on sense of what is unique about digital economics and business models, from new businesses like 3-D printing to "classics" like Facebook. They also do a deep dive into data analytics. "There are datasets available now that simply weren't possible a decade ago," says Lakhani. But access to data is not the same thing as understanding the data correctly. "Many of the tools available now make it easy to look at correlations between two factors and draw incorrect conclusions; that can drive exactly the wrong decisions." Students also consider the expanding practice of leveraging crowds for innovation and how crowdsourcing models have played out in different business environments. Lakhani notes, for example, that digital innovation has changed the models and mechanisms around financing. "We always thought innovation financing would be a hierarchical, top-down model like venture capital," he says. Companies like Kickstarter-a crowdfunding site that anyone can access and participate in—have changed that view. An additional course focus is digital transformation, or how companies across all industries are evolving, from music to advertising to industrial products. A course segment on organizations that tried to change and failed—like Nokia—is also included. "We talk about why Google would buy Nest—a thermostat company—and how it is also getting into the car business," says Iansiti. "Ford is realizing that its future competitors are likely to be Facebook and Google and not BMW and Toyota." "We talk about why Google would buy Nest—a thermostat company—and how it is also getting into the car business" Students use the HBS Open Forum platform to file assignments, for example posting short essays with the option to include graphics, data, and video to describe a company that is exceling at digital transformation. Participants are encouraged to comment on other posts and engage with the wider community, resulting in a cross-pollination of ideas that broadens the overall conversation. HBS Professor Clayton M. Christensen leveraged the same platform for a new approach to research by reaching out to over 5,000 alumni of his Building and Sustaining a Successful Enterprise course. As a result, 126 participants contributed insights included in his June 2014 Harvard Business Review article The Capitalist's Dilemma . More recently, HBS's Health Care and Digital initiatives collaborated on the Health Acceleration Challenge to identify proven innovations that, if scaled, would dramatically enhance health care value. They netted almost 500 entrants, reaching 20,000 visitors and engaging 2,500 commentators, ultimately selecting four finalists who will benefit from an advisory network of health care industry leaders including many HBS alumni, be the subject of a teaching case, and receive a cash prize of over $35,000. An upcoming D/I event—one of a number offered throughout the year—also ties into Iansiti and Lakhani's Digital Innovation and Transformation course, giving MBA students, faculty, and practitioners a chance to explore and address digital challenges and opportunities. The #digHBS Summit, to be held March 30, will engage D/I advisors, friends, and faculty in interactive discussions, tighten the feedback loop between scholarship and practice, and complement students' academic coursework with tales from the proverbial frontlines of practice. Participants will take on a range of issues affecting businesses that have been transformed by digital, such as those in the music, news, and entertainment industries. The gathering will look at the emerging collaborative and sharing economies, explore organizational change in a digital context, consider the implications of new technologies for health care, and ask hard questions about the promise and peril of big data. The emphasis in all of this, Iansiti and Lakhani point out, is on doing, whether in teaching, learning, or research. "There is a direct engagement with the world that is bringing HBS closer to the medical school or engineering school model," says Lakhani. "The costs of engaging with the world and having an impact have dropped dramatically." Iansiti points out that there is also, unfortunately, a downside to this new reality. "We are just beginning to appreciate the implications of this highly connected environment and how quickly risk pools across different parties," he says. However its impact may be felt, technology can no longer be shunted along to segregated departments or individuals. It has become fundamental to even the most traditional aspects of management, from building competitive advantage to understanding customers to forecasting trends and boosting productivity. "The genie is out of the bottle," says Lakhani. "As a result, we need to educate, train, and inform." About the author </text>

<title>Inventing Products is Less Valuable Than Inventing Ideas — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>29 Oct 2014  Research &amp; Ideas Inventing Products is Less Valuable Than Inventing Ideas When companies create new products, they are often also inventing new ideas—and that's where the real value resides. Gautam Ahuja discusses why companies fall short in fully exploiting their intellectual capital.   by Michael Blanding In a well-marked line from the movie The Social Network, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg turns to the Winklevoss twins, who are suing him for stealing their invention, and says: "If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook." The words speak volumes about the origins of one of the most successful companies on the planet, but are also a commentary on the origins of any invention. "Anytime you invent something, you have really invented two things—the thing itself, and an idea," says Harvard Business School visiting professor Gautam Ahuja , a professor of strategy at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. In the case of Zuckerberg vs. the Winklevosses, the twins may have had created a simple interface for college kids to connect with one another, but it took Zuckerberg to take the idea and turn it into that of a worldwide social network that would allow everyone to share their lives with one another across geographies. "Compared to the value of the global network idea, the value of the actual product of a platform for college kids was much less," says Ahuja. "Often the concept value of the invention is more important than the physical aspect." "Companies don't fully exploit the latest ideas that their product has created" In a paper published last year in the Academy of Management Review called "The Second Face of Appropriability: Generative Appropriability and Its Determinants," Ahuja makes distinctions between two types of value: "primary appropriability," or a company's' ability to exploit the opportunity of an invention by turning it into a product, and "generative appropriability," a firm's ability to capture the later value inherent in the idea. "Often companies don't fully exploit the latest ideas that their product has created," says Ahuja, who wrote the paper with Curba Lampert of Florida International University and Elena Novelli of City University London. "They go on and create new products and inventions without realizing the potential for building new products out of their existing inventions." Take Xerox, for example. Its research center, Xerox PARC, famously had invented the graphical user interface, mouse, laser printing, and other technologies that would later become commonplace in modern computing, but did not commercialize the innovations. It was Steve Jobs and his Apple team that saw the possibilities during visits in 1979 and made them the cornerstone of the Macintosh. In other words, while Xerox may have invented many wonderful things, it did not necessarily profit from them in terms of either primary or generative appropriability. By contrast, years later, Apple broke new ground in the creation of the iPod, a simple portable device that allowed users to play music through a digital library. But it didn't stop there. Realizing the potential of the invention, Apple employed many of the ideas used in the iPod as a foundation for an entirely new product, the iPhone. And then it increased the size and added functions to create the iPad, a portable tablet computer. "It was already halfway to becoming a computer, and they completed the job," says Ahuja. "Apple is a company with good generative appropriability that is constantly building on its ideas to create new products." When ideas conflict While such ingenuity may seem like a simple process of brainstorming on current inventions to create new ones, it comes with a catch. Oftentimes, says Ahuja, primary and generative appropriability are in conflict with one another. "Very often, the things that help you make the most money out of an invention are in conflict with the things that help you create most value out of an idea." Look no further than Facebook's rival MySpace to see how too strong a focus on the former can hurt the latter. Acquired by NewsCorp in 2005, MySpace exploited the commercial potential of social networking by selling ads to create profit; however, in focusing on commercialization too early it arguably failed to adequately develop the full potential of the concept. Facebook, by contrast, has been very careful about monetizing its site only gradually over time through the collection of customer data—all the while developing the idea by layering on new services such as messaging, photo sharing, and location tagging that continue to make it increasingly valuable to users. Companies also have to weigh the importance of protecting the primary versus the generative value of a product. The natural way to protect an idea is to patent it, but that mechanism is not always effective. Epilady invented a new way of shaving that involved wrapping hair on a spring and pulling it out of the skin instead of cutting it. By patenting that process, however, it gave competitors insight into the idea. Competitors with deeper pockets used the same concept with elaborated features that would go beyond the ones patented to outperform Epilady in the market, and the company eventually lost out. In this case, says Ahuja, the company may have been better off giving up its product and instead profiting by licensing the idea to Gillette or another large company. "Companies patent something to prevent others from coming into their space, but often patents are not effective against follow-on inventions and sometimes patenting eases the task for other to design around them," says Ahuja. "Whenever you invent something, you open up a trajectory and people are going to come after you. And if they have better assets to solve the problem, they can come up with a better product." ""Whenever you invent something, you open up a trajectory and people are going to come after you." The other choice companies have is to keep an idea secret in order to protect the value of the idea and maximize generative appropriability. Of course, that course can lead to its own pitfalls, since it leaves companies little recourse in the event that someone else steals their idea. But there are things they can do to protect their idea while still keeping it secret, says Ahuja—for example, dispersing research activities across different geographic locations to keep competitors in a certain area from capitalizing on the R&amp;D infrastructure you set up. Ahuja also advises creating moderately sized research teams; not too large that they become bureaucratic and unproductive, but not too small that one person can take the idea out the door when they leave for another job. "If you have a research team of three people, someone hired away has 33 percent of the idea. But if you subdivide it into eight people, each one of those people becomes less attractive to a competitor." Setting the right conditions For companies looking to increase their generative appropriabilty, Ahuja offers advice as well. "Push for stretch goals in innovation," he says. Under pressure to produce in a short period of time, research teams are necessarily forced to go back and find new value in what has already been done than reinventing the wheel. Likewise, firms are better off providing moderate levels of resources—not too much and not too little—to research teams. "If the budget is too small, there is little possibility of creating new products," says Ahuja. "But if it's too high, there is no incentive to go back and look at your own ideas." With a level in the middle, R&amp;D teams will both forced to look at current ideas and able to take them in new directions. Finally, says Ahuja, it's essential to put a knowledge management system in place that provides incentives for new designers to talk to old-guard engineers rather than just reading about their inventions on paper. He cites the words of former Hewlett-Packard CEO Lew Platt: "If only HP knew what HP knows, we would be three times more productive." Just the interchange between old and new designers can help generate new ideas from old ones. That's not to say that companies should only look to the past, but follow guidelines like these, says Ahuja, and companies will be in the best position to get the most out of the ideas they invent. "Inventions can be cumulative," says Ahuja. "You can build new inventions based on your past inventions. One part of the company is going out there to make the money, and the other part is staying behind saying now that we solved that problem, what else can we do with this" Answering that question can create brave new inventions out of ideas you've already had.

<title>Leading Innovation is the Art of Creating ‘Collective Genius’ — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>Read An Excerpt   The authors identified organizations with reputations for being highly innovative, then found 16 leaders within those organizations and studied how they worked. Determined to feature a global perspective, the authors include narratives of executives within India-based IT company HCL Technologies, the German division of online auctioneer eBay, and the marketing division of automaker Volkswagen in Europe. Willing to take chances In a chapter devoted to how executives can create the ability to innovate in their group, the authors explore how Pixar's Brandeau, eBay's Philipp Justus, and Google's Bill Coughran use discussion, conflict, and trial and error to advantage. At Pixar, for example, the company was caught up short in 2008 in a clash over production schedules for the movie Up and the short film Cars Toons. Blindsided by news that Cars Toons was behind schedule, coauthor Brandeau had to figure out how to finish both projects on time with limited computing resources while also limiting friction among the forces. The crazy solution: Brandeau asked Disney Animation Disney bought Pixar in 2006 if the studio could borrow 250 computers, an idea someone initially called "insane." The team trucked the computers 360 miles from Burbank, California, to Emeryville, near San Francisco, setting the systems up over a weekend. The move worked and the studio hit both deadlines. The book cites short-term innovation, in the decision to borrow the computers, and the team's ability to creatively resolve conflict, as marks of innovative leadership. At eBay Germany, the authors found examples of how a maturing company like eBay can retain its innovative spirit. For a holiday promotion, a young project manager and his marketing colleagues launched a "treasure hunt," working nonstop to launch registration pages, clues, and an hourly countdown clock. Trouble was, the launch violated eBay's well-established corporate project-development processes. When the treasure hunt began, 10 million contestants logged on, crashing the local servers. Justus, eBay's senior VP in charge of Europe, could have stopped this and other similar "micro-projects," but instead he decided to pursue them and fly under the radar of corporate headquarters. Successful innovations emerged, such as an Easy Lister feature, and separate registration processes for private and business sellers. Later, Justus shared the successes with then CEO Meg Whitman, which led to a global micro-projects strategy. With eBay, Hill says, the authors wanted to show how Whitman's willingness to experiment with rapid prototyping "broke rules to get something done," and modeled such behavior for the entire organization. Collective Genius shows how Bill Coughran, Google's then senior vice president of engineering, created an environment where engineers could figure out on their own how to best address the company's massive storage challenges in 2006. The problem: Storage issues were created by the huge amount of data processed by the Google File System, GFS, designed for Google web searches. One team, called Big Table, argued for adding systems on top of GFS; the other team, called Build from Scratch, wanted to replace GFS entirely. Coughran decided to give the two teams space to defend their ideas, letting them collect data and test rigorously. The Build from Scratch team eventually realized its system wouldn't meet the company's requirements, but members were assigned to work on a next-generation system and many of those ideas were eventually used. Coughran gave the teams the room they needed to create a resolution, the mark of a leader who lets innovation happen, Hill says. He also never tried to be the visionary, the expert, or the decisive "I'm in charge," leader, she says. Instead he asked difficult and probing questions during regular review meetings that helped frame issues and sharpen discussions. "He wasn't passive," Hill says. "He was weighing two things and letting them play out." Companies often make the mistake of compromising too early or letting one or two groups dominate. "He allowed both ideas to be developed and tested enough, to learn and not combine them right away," Hill says. "He let them play it out. His job as leader was to figure out when to step in." THE "YOUNG SPARKS" Of the 16 leaders studied, Hill says Delhi-based HCL, under former CEO Vineer Nayar, might be the boldest. Nayar, who pulled the company out of a five-year slump, challenged the common belief that Indian companies provide low-cost products and services but don't innovate. "That assumption made him crazy," Hill says. "He said 'We can and will compete that way.' " Nayar focused on changing the organization from within, starting by empowering employees. In 2005, he told a team of 30-something young employees called the "Young Sparks" to develop the brand and a plan to change how employees experienced HCL. The group started with an icon, Thambi, which means "brother" in Tamil, symbolizing "the importance of the individual and the value of the collective" at HCL. Nayar recast his role as leader. He pushed for more transparency, adding 360-degree reviews for all employees and 360-degree feedback of his own work—he promised to resign if his own review dropped to a certain level. He set up a portal that asked employees to solve "my problems" and reported getting incredible answers from workers. From 2005 to 2013, when Nayar led HCL as president and then CEO, the company's sales, market cap, and profits increased six fold, according to the book. Fortune magazine wrote that the HCL had "the world's most modern management" and the company was named one of Businessweek's most influential companies. Nayar tells people, "I don't know the answers," which goes against the common belief in Indian business that the CEO should be a visionary. For Hill, Nayar shows the possibilities of what can be accomplished by an innovative leader who embraces a new style of leadership. Since finishing the book, Hill has been traveling, meeting with business and organizational leaders about how to implement the team's leadership ideas at different management levels. "We're meeting with a lot of interesting people to try to figure this out," she says. About the author </text>

<title>Does Internet Technology Threaten Brand Loyalty? — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>04 Jun 2014  What Do YOU Think Does Internet Technology Threaten Brand Loyalty Internet technologies may not kill off brands, but they certainly magnify both the bad and good decisions of marketers. Jim Heskett's readers weight in on this month's question.   Summing Up Is the Potential Negative Impact of New Information Technologies on Customer Loyalties Overstated Customers will remain loyal to brands that meet their needs, regardless of the effects of new information technologies on their general knowledge about products and services. But new information technologies will punish weak brands faster and more severely than in the past. That's the general sense I received from responses to this month's column. There was a minority opinion, however. As Carl P. put it, "If you have more information to make what you consider to be an informed choice, why would you have to be brand loyal" Consumer loyalty, he continued, "will vary and fluctuate on a technological continuum of innovation/change loyal one day and maybe not the next." Based on personal experience, Ed Kensinger said that his exposure to a superior product and service on the Internet "could never have happened before … and poses a threat to brand loyalty." If there is a weakness in your offering you are at risk. Others were reluctant to reach such a judgment. In concluding that this is not an either/or choice, Nuno Cintra Torres commented that some people will always need references such as brands. Others will be more adventurous, enjoying the search for new features. "At the core of human behaviour is human biology and that will not change because of information technology." There were doubts both about the quality of the information delivered by new technologies and consumers' ability to use them effectively. Gabriel pointed out that reviews are highly subjective "so you end up not knowing what to believe… The Internet and social media don't always make us better informed." Sergio Zaragoza suggested that this topic is "like the story of King Midas, we will be starved by the excess of golden information." Still others suggested that marketers have little to fear, especially if they are willing and able to strengthen their brands. As Edward Hare put it, "I don't see the Internet 'technology' as a threat to customer loyalty…. Loyalty is earned by meeting and exceeding expectations. Do that, and you can maintain loyal customers." AIM added, "It is not the advances in information technology that have affected our loyalties … but lack of focus on our true needs." However, there was a sense that new information technology could exact a heavy toll on marketers not able to raise their standards and performance. Gerald Nanninga commented that if marketers have a great story to tell, "the Internet is your friend. If you don't, then failure is accelerated. Think of it as a results magnifier—in either direction." Is the potential negative impact of new information technologies on customer loyalties overstated What do you think Original Article The world is fascinated by an international debate about information technology, security, and access to "secrets." Views referenced years ago in this column are playing out in the diverse worlds of national security, spying, and patriotism. Harlan Cleveland's words of more than 30 years ago keep coming to mind: "The information resource, in short, is different in kind from other resources. So it has to be a mistake to carry over uncritically to the management of information those concepts that have proven so useful during the centuries when things were the dominant resources.... These concepts include … the notion of hiding and hoarding a resource." It's clear that information technologies have brought us into a new age of international relations, but they have profound implications for the way we do business as well. For example, a question has arisen about how information both about us and available to us affects our behaviors, specifically our loyalty as consumers and employees. There are two predominant sides to the discussion of this question. One is that the amount of information about products and services is becoming so voluminous that it will lead to increased consumer confusion. As a result, the use of surrogates such as brands in our purchasing decisions will lead to greater brand loyalty, justifying today's massive expenditures to preserve brands. The other view is that the quality of Internet "technologies," such as search and feedback mechanisms, is improving faster than the proliferation of information. This will give users of the Internet the upper hand in the battle for access to information and the ability to organize it, value it based on feedback from users, and use it for decision-making. The authors of a recent book, Absolute Value: What Really Influences Customers in the Age of Nearly Perfect Information, believe the latter outcome is the most likely, based on extensive research at Stanford and elsewhere. It will increase the tendency, particularly among younger consumers, to try new goods and services, possibly switching their loyalties. If this turns out to be the case, it calls into question a good portion of marketing beliefs and expenditures regarding brand building and the lifetime value of a customer. It may also suggest different approaches to the management of human resources, specifically methods for retaining employees who will be better informed about the job market. If true, a better informed and less loyal customer is a big deal for others as well. It's important for those among us who believe that employee and customer loyalty are important determinants of businesses' growth and profitability. It may mean a lot for us as consumers as well, because the effectiveness of the search apps we use will probably be enhanced by the information that others have about us. Will big data overwhelm us, thereby reinforcing such things as brand loyalty Or will the quality of our search and valuation devices make us smarter, and less loyal, customers for goods, services, and even jobs What do your own experiences tell you Is Internet "technology" a threat to loyalty What do you think To read more: Harlan Cleveland, "Information as a Resource," The Futurist, December, 1982, p. 37. </text>

<title>Technology Re-Emergence: Creating New Value for Old Innovations — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>06 Jan 2014  Research &amp; Ideas Technology Re-Emergence: Creating New Value for Old Innovations Every once in a while, an old technology rises from the ashes and finds new life. Ryan Raffaelli explains how the Swiss watch industry saved itself by reinventing its identity.   by Carmen Nobel Out with the old, in with the new! That's the natural path of innovation. PCs killed typewriters, for instance. Smartphones superseded telephones, pocket calculators, and point-and-shoot cameras. Every once in a while, though, an old technology rises from the ashes and finds new life: a re-emergence. "What this research suggests is that it is possible to prolong the life of some technologies, along with the organizations and communities that support them" Take, for example, the mechanical wristwatch. Swiss watchmakers dominated the industry for centuries until the mid-1970s, when the Japanese introduced low cost production methods to manufacture highly accurate quartz watches. Swiss business historians refer to this as the "Quartz Crisis." Companies like Seiko and Casio seized the quartz market. By 1983, two-thirds of the watch industry jobs in Switzerland had disappeared, and the country was producing only 10 percent of the world's watches. Yet Switzerland has reemerged as the global leader of watch exports by export value, due to a newfound market demand for old-style mechanical watches. This curious comeback story has led Ryan Raffaelli to ask how organizations, industries, and technologies re-emerge from the brink of collapse. And while his initial research has focused on the watch industry, his findings also help explain a recent resurgence of independent bookstores, a renaissance of streetcars in numerous urban city centers, and the revival of several seemingly archaic products including the fountain pen and the vinyl record. "What this research suggests is that it is possible to prolong the life of some technologies, along with the organizations and communities that support them," says Raffaelli, an assistant professor in the Organizational Behavior unit at Harvard Business School. "Successful companies may be able to reposition a 'dying' technology by redefining its identity and value for the customer." Raffaelli details his research in the paper Mechanisms of Technology Re-Emergence and Identity Change in a Mature Field: Swiss Watchmaking, 1970-2008 . Based on his doctoral thesis, the paper discusses the role of key individuals, organizations, and industry associations in bringing a technology back to life. The paper explains that the successful re-emergence of an old technology relies on several factors: the opportunity to redefine the technology's value; an organization's acceptance of the new definition; an entire industry's buy-in of the same; and a healthy tension between those pushing for innovation and those protecting the technology's legacy. Redefining a product's value As their industry hit the skids, Swiss watchmakers realized they could no longer cite time-keeping precision as the main selling point of a handcrafted mechanical watch, Raffaelli explains. Quartz enabled mass-produced accuracy on the cheap. A revival depended on a new reason to embrace the older technology. The mechanical watchmaking revival began when Nicolas Hayek, a former management consultant, bought up several of the industry's suffering brands and production companies and consolidated them into the Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie SMH. The former CEO of one of those companies, Ernst Tompke, then proposed the idea of a low-cost quartz design that would compete in the market not on precision, but on fashion. SMH pursued the risky idea, but the project's young engineers, Elmar Mock and Jacque Muller, found themselves ostracized by many of their skeptical colleagues. In 1983, SMH launched its brand of colorful Swatch watches. A portmanteau of "second watch," Swatch essentially introduced the idea of an inexpensive quartz watch as a fashion accessory. The strategy was wildly successful, with sales exceeding 50 million units by 1988. But rather than continue to rely solely on cheap quartz watches, SMH and other Swiss watchmakers used the success as an opportunity to reintroduce mechanical watches to the market. This time they were advertised not simply as precision timepieces, but as carefully crafted luxury items tied to a centuries-old tradition. Again, the strategy worked. SMH eventually became Swatch Group, which saw sales of more than CHF 8 billion in 2012. In addition to Swatch, the company owns prestige brands such as Breguet, Blancpain, and Omega, whose watches can sell for upwards of $100,000 apiece. Raffaelli describes this strategy in terms of coupling: an initial strong coupling of product and organizational identity, a temporary de-coupling from both the old technology and original identity, and a subsequent re-coupling with the old technology—but with a new organizational identity. "The fashion period served as a cleansing of the palate for Swiss watchmaking, like a sorbet served between two large portions of a meal" Raffaelli says. "It was a chance to reset. It bought them enough time to reposition who they were as an industry. Watches have moved from being precision instruments to prestige luxury items. Luxury was always part of the industry, but now it's responsible for much of the growth trajectory." The guardians and the entrepreneurs So how did the Swiss watchmakers know when to re-embrace mechanical watches According to several industry CEOs that Raffaelli interviewed for his research, the industry received a wake-up call from a small but loyal group of purists: mechanical watch collectors. "When things looked really bad for the mechanical watch industry, when the industry seemed on the verge of collapse, watch collectors started buying mechanical watches at auction at record prices," Raffaelli explains. "This sent a signal to the industry that aha, there may still be latent value in what they thought was a dead technology. And so these collectors become almost like canaries in a coalmine, in a good way. They sent a signal of hope that there might still be value there." It turned out that some players within the industry had been holding on to the old technology all along, too. Raffaelli recounts the story of Zenith, which, like many Swiss watch companies, decided to throw away all of its mechanical watchmaking moulds in the midst of the quartz crisis. But one veteran employee couldn't stand the idea of scrapping these historical production tools, and took the liberty to hide them in a shed at the back of the factory. A few years later, mechanical watchmaking was back in vogue. Now under new ownership, Zenith realized the need to revisit the old technology, which, fortunately for the owners, had been hiding in a shed all along. "At that point this old employee returns and says, 'I preserved all the dies and technical drawings, and I will reintroduce them to you,'" Raffaelli explains. "The lesson for managers is that leadership as a catalyst for re-emergence has to take place not only at the industry level and the organizational level, but right on the factory floors." Raffaelli describes the watch collectors and the old employee as institutional guardians, who encourage preservation of past technologies and traditions in the face of change. These guardians serve as a counterbalance to institutional entrepreneurs, who push for organizational and industry change at all costs. He maintains that both are necessary for successful re-emergence. The tension between the two creates what he calls identity ambidexterity—holding on to the values and capabilities of the past while at the same time recognizing the need to adapt to the future. "A lot of companies fail because they cannot do both things simultaneously," he says. "Here we have an example of a whole industry that managed to do both, and to navigate a comeback." Redefining competition Redefining an industry's value also means redefining the competition, Raffaelli says. And in order for a technology to resurge, the whole industry must do that. In the case of the Swiss, for example, they were no longer competing against the Casios and Seikos of the world, but rather creating a new market for luxury watches. Another example: fountain pens. The industry sold approximately 45 million units in 1957. Sales then plunged to 7 million units by 1974 due to the rise of the ballpoint pen. But in 2007, annual sales of fountain pens had rebounded to almost 20 million units. The reason: Fountain pens were now marketed not simply as utilitarian writing implements, but also as nostalgic fashion accessories. As such, they were not really in the same competitive market as ballpoint pens anymore. "The question becomes whether you're competing on the old terms or on a set of new terms," Raffaelli says. "And what I'm finding in industries that successfully re-emerge is that they redefine their competitive set - the group of organizations upon which they want to compete and the value proposition that they send to the consumer." Lately, Raffaelli has turned his focus toward bookstores. A few years ago, it seemed like mega-chains like Borders Books might squelch independent bookstores. What happened instead was that online booksellers squelched Borders, which had shuttered all 511 of its super-stores by 2011. Meanwhile, the independents are slowly reemerging. In 1995, the American Booksellers Association had a membership of some 5,500 stores. By 2009 that number had plummeted to 1,401. But the number has revived a bit to 1,632 today. While Borders was competing on price, Raffaelli explains, the independents were forging a renewed competitive identity. "Independent bookstores were founded on the idea of community building," Raffaelli says. "And today they have shifted their sole focus away from the books they sell—Amazon can do that. Rather, they have shifted their attention to build communities for their readers. They've connected with consumers' desire to be with others who are like themselves. The Swiss understood the importance of helping consumers build an emotional connection with their watches. My sense is that the same holds true for the independent bookstores that are getting it right. To survive, they're shifting their organizational identities to create emotional value in their communities." The lesson for managers is that a new technology is not always the only way to get ahead of the curve when older technologies or industries appear to be reaching the end of their life. "The value of some products may go beyond pure functionality to embrace non-functional aspects that can influence consumer buying behaviors," Raffaelli says. "Although it is unlikely that such emotional or self-expressive benefits will completely trump function, exploring these other elements can provide organizations with valuable extra time to develop possible adaptation or repositioning strategies." Note to managers: Ryan Raffaelli continues to investigate how troubled industries and organizations are able to reemerge and thrive.

<title>Information and Incentives in Online Affiliate Marketing — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>10 Dec 2013  Working Papers Information and Incentives in Online Affiliate Marketing by Benjamin G. Edelman and Wesley Brandi Executive Summary — Compared to historic advertising methods, online marketing invites advertisers to attempt a sharply increased quantity of partnerships. Online relationships reduce the transaction costs of buying ad placements. In many advertising marketplaces, standardized contracts let an advertiser accept a proposed placement with a single click, and ad networks widely sell bundles of hundreds or thousands of placements. Meanwhile, many advertisers find they can get valuable leads and favorable pricing from the Internet's myriad small sites. These numerous relationships entail costs, too, such as selecting, compensating, and supervising the sites, making sure each site is suitable to show the advertiser's offer, and making sure sites in fact deliver the promised benefits. Advertisers thus turn to specialists and outside firms to handle important aspects of advertising-buying. In this paper, the authors evaluate advertisers' chosen management structures by measuring the relative prevalence of advertising fraud targeting advertisers engaged in online "affiliate marketing," a performance-based compensation system increasingly common in online ad campaigns. Specifically, the authors identify the vulnerabilities best addressed by outsourcing marketing management to external specialists, versus the problems better overseen by keeping management decisions in-house. They find outside advisors most effective at enforcing clear rules, but in-house staff excel at preventing practices viewed as "borderline" under industry norms. While the results apply most directly to advertisers considering the management structure of their online marketing programs, the analysis also speaks to broader concerns of outsourcing and the boundary of the firm. Key concepts include: Affiliate marketing broadly aligns incentives between advertisers and affiliates by compensating affiliates only when sales occur. Rogue affiliates may seek commissions they have not fairly earned, typically by claiming to have referred customers who were already going to buy. Alternative structures of affiliate program management can influence merchants' vulnerability to affiliate fraud. Outsourced marketing managers tend to enjoy superior information about affiliates' practices, but outsourcers' incentives differ from advertisers' objectives.   Author Abstract We consider alternative methods of supervising staff who have significant discretion and whose efforts are subject to both incomplete information and skewed incentives. Specifically, we examine online affiliate marketing programs in which merchants oversee thousands of affiliates they have never met. Some merchants hire specialist outside advisors to set and enforce policies for affiliates, while other merchants ask their ordinary marketing staff to perform these functions. For clear violations of applicable rules, we find that outside advisors are most effective at excluding the responsible affiliates-which we interpret as a benefit of specialization. However, in-house staff are more successful at identifying and excluding affiliates whose practices are viewed as "borderline" albeit still contrary to merchants' interests, foregoing the efficiencies of specialization in favor of the better incentives of a company's staff. We consider implications for marketing of online affiliate programs and for online marketing more generally.

<title>Twitter IPO: Overvalued or the Start of Something Big? — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>18 Nov 2013  Views on News Twitter IPO: Overvalued or the Start of Something Big Although it has yet to make a dime, share buyers valued Twitter's IPO at $25 billion. Asks professor Chet Huber, what do they see   by Chet Huber Twitter soared high on its first day of trading on Nov. 7, with its shares closing the day at $45 for a value of $25 billion. Even though TWTR has yet to make money, investors flocked to the stock in droves, eager to own a part of the company that has revolutionized the way people around the world communicate and made abbreviations like RT retweet and ICYMI in case you missed it part of the lingo of Twitter users everywhere. What to make of all this Senior Lecturer Chet Huber , who joined the School's General Management unit after 37 years at General Motors and teaches a popular elective focusing on disruptive technologies, offers his analysis of the Twitter IPO phenomenon. In our second-year MBA elective Building and Sustaining a Successful Enterprise a course developed by my colleague Clay Christensen, one of the concepts we study is new market disruption. Twitter exemplifies that term, allowing its users to "consume" information in ways that were formerly unavailable to them due to cost, complexity, or both. The fact that half a billion consumers willingly engage on Twitter's platform confirms the viability of the "job" they're being "hired" to perform, providing opportunities for real-time conversations and engagement to people around the world. The company has accomplished this by taking advantage of the modular nature of today's ubiquitous communications infrastructures provided by the Internet and wireless data networks, whose massive investments and standard interfaces have allowed Twitter to focus on their unique plug-and-play component. Beyond that, they have created impressive and scalable operating capabilities of their own though an impressive combination of resources and processes. They have built it, and others have come—in high volume. So far, so good. What's missing is the confirmation of a profit formula that turns volume into serious cash. Another theory we think about in new growth situations is something we call "good money/bad money." It asserts that in the early stages of an enterprise, when the business model and profit formula are not clear, investors represent good money if they're impatient for confidence in the emerging idea's profit model and patient for growth while that's being figured out. Scaling before having a viable profit formula commits resources to a path with high risks to capital, but more important, risks committing to an approach that may need to fundamentally change—something that is harder to accomplish at scale. That said, the pursuit of coveted "network effects," with winner-take-all rewards to the dominant platform and a high number of users, argues for getting big fast and figuring the profit part out later. The concept is overused, but it's in play here, and the market, at least for now, is applauding loudly—to the tune of a market capitalization of some $25 billion at the close of the first day of trading last Thursday. Where does this go Only one thing is for sure, the underlying forces that we call disruption are already at work in this relatively new category that has anointed Twitter as the leader of the pack. Sustaining a successful business position generally requires two things: having a successful position and being able to leverage its viability in an adaptive fashion to meet the challenges presented by new, disruptive insurgents. In this case, figuring out that model while others are building new ones to attack it under the glare of incredibly high investor expectations should make for a lot of interesting times ahead. My colleagues and I will be watching closely, along with 500 million or so other users and observers. </text>

<title>Is Your iPhone Turning You Into a Wimp? — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>24 Jun 2013  Research &amp; Ideas Is Your iPhone Turning You Into a Wimp The body posture inherent in operating everyday gadgets affects not only your back, but your behavior. According to a new study by Maarten Bos and Amy Cuddy, operating a relatively large device inspires more assertive behavior than working on a small one.   by Carmen Nobel What kind of a device are you using to read this article And what does your body posture look like Are you hunching over a smartphone screen, arms tightly at your side Are you slouching over an iPad or laptop Or are you stretched out comfortably in an office chair, scanning a large desktop monitor The answer may determine whether you'll play the wimp or the hero in your next office meeting. The body posture inherent in operating everyday gadgets affects not only your back, but your demeanor, reports a new experimental study entitled iPosture: The Size of Electronic Consumer Devices Affects Our Behavior . It turns out that working on a relatively large machine like a desktop computer causes users to act more assertively than working on a small one like an iPad. "We wanted to study how interacting with a device affected how people behave afterward." "People are always interacting with their smartphones before a meeting begins, thinking of it as an efficient way to manage their time," says Maarten Bos, a post-doctoral research fellow at Harvard Business School, who co-wrote the study with HBS Associate Professor Amy Cuddy . "We wanted to study how interacting with a device affected how people behave afterward." The study is related to previous experimental research in which Cuddy and colleagues prove the positive effects of adopting expansive body postures - hands on hips, feet on desk, and the like. Deliberately positioning the body in one of these "power poses" for just a few minutes actually affects body chemistry, increasing testosterone levels and decreasing cortisol levels. This leads to higher confidence, more willingness to take risks, and a greater sense of well-being, according to the 2010 report by Andy Yap , Cuddy and Dana Carney , " Power Posing: Brief Nonverbal Displays Affect Neuroendocrine Levels and Risk Tolerance ." Contractive body postures such as folded arms have shown the opposite effect, decreasing testosterone and increasing cortisol. Bos and Cuddy wondered whether there might be behavioral ramifications from using electronic devices. Looming over his colleagues at six feet, seven inches tall, Bos must contract his body more than most of us when operating a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. But many of us constrict our neck and hunch our shoulders when we use our phones. And statistics show that we use our phones a lot. Americans spend an average of 58 minutes per day on their smartphones, according to a recent report from Experian Marketing Services . Talking accounts for only 26 percent of that time. The other 73 percent is devoted to texting, e-mail, social networking, and web-surfing - in other words, activities spent hunched over a little screen. Usage varies according to the type of smartphone: iPhone users spend an average of one hour and 15 minutes with their phones each day, with only 22 percent of that time devoted to talking. The lab experiment Bos and Cuddy hypothesized that, compared with smaller devices, interacting with larger devices would lead to more expansive body postures, which in turn would lead to behaviors associated with power—including assertiveness and risk-taking behavior. Previous experimental research had shown that people were more likely to gamble after holding their bodies in expansive poses and less likely in constrictive poses. Now they wanted to look into whether behavior was affected during the poses. This might help to answer questions like: Would people be more likely to join a game of online poker while using a desktop computer than while using an iPhone Would they be more likely to bid higher on an eBay auction when competing to buy a product To test their hypothesis, Bos and Cuddy conducted an experiment at the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory, a university-wide research facility for behavioral research. They paid 75 participants $10 each and randomly assigned them to perform a series of tasks on one of four devices, each successively larger than the next: an iPod Touch which looks like an iPhone, an iPad, a MacBook Pro laptop, or an iMac desktop computer. Each participant sat alone in a room during the experiment, monitored by a research assistant. The experiment went like this: After five minutes of using the assigned device to take an online survey, each participant was given two dollars, along with the choice of keeping it or gambling it in a double-or-nothing gambling game with 50/50 odds. Next, the participant continued with a few other tasks and a final questionnaire, all on the assigned device. When the participants were done with the tasks, the researcher pointed to a clock in the room and said, "I will get some forms ready for you to sign so I can pay you and you can leave. If I am not here in five minutes, please come get me at the front desk." Rather than returning in five minutes, though, the researcher waited a maximum of ten minutes, recording whether and/or when the participant had come out to the front desk. A beautiful effect The experiments showed no apparent effect on the participants' gambling behavior. The majority chose to gamble the two dollars and to risk taking another card in Blackjack, regardless of which piece of Apple equipment they were using. However, device size substantially affected whether the participant left the room after waiting the requisite five minutes. Of the participants using a desktop computer, 94 percent took the initiative to fetch the experimenter. For those using the iPod Touch, only 50 percent left the room. And among those who did leave the room, the device size seemed to affect the amount of time they waited to do so. The bigger the device was, the shorter the wait time. On average, desktop users waited 341 seconds before fetching the experimenter, for instance, while iPod Touch users waited an average of 493 seconds. "The steady increase of waiting time is locked in step with the size of the device," Bos says. "I have never before in my life seen such a beautiful effect." The results indicate that expansive body postures lead to power-related behaviors, even in cases where the posture is incidentally induced by the size of the gadget or computer. As for the difference between the gambling and waiting results, this may indicate that it takes a little while for body posture to affect behavior. After all, it was the final task of the experiment that garnered the dramatic results. "So, what we're thinking now is that you need at least a few minutes of interacting with a device, or, more importantly, of being in a specific posture related to that device, before you find effects," Bos says. However, he says, it will take additional experiments to determine whether expansive postures are only effective after the fact. "It may be that power-posing doesn't actually work during the power-posing, but it works right after," he says, "Future research will tell." Next steps In a related line of work, the researchers are studying whether our behavior is affected by how we sleep - curled up in the fetal position, for example, versus limbs sprawled across the bed. Bos and Cuddy also are planning to conduct a field experiment, measuring the effect of device-induced body posture in an actual office setting. In the meantime, the initial lab results suggest it may be a good idea to avoid the smartphone immediately before your next big sales meeting. Texting up until the boss starts speaking may make you look busy, but it may make you act meek. "We won't tell anyone not to interact with those devices just before doing something that requires any kind of assertiveness," Bos says. "Mostly because people won't listen: They will do it anyway. But if you realize that, 'hmm, I'm pretty quiet during this meeting,' then maybe you should pay attention to how devices impacted your body posture beforehand." About the authors </text>

<title>How Will the “Age of Big Data” Affect Management? — HBS Working Knowledge</title>
<text>25 Apr 2012  What Do YOU Think How Will the “Age of Big Data” Affect Management Summing up: How do we avoid losing useful knowledge in a seemingly endless flood of data Jim Heskett's readers offer some wise suggestions. What do you think   Summing up: Will Access to Big Data Further Enable Fact-Based Decision Making or … Analysis Paralysis "To T. S. Eliot's prescient words 'Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge Where is the knowledge we have lost in information' we might now add, 'Where is the information we have lost in data'" That's Paul Nicholas' reaction after reading most of the responses to this month's column. It's not a bad "sense of the meeting," in which many contributors offered suggestions to managers wishing to get the most out of so-called big data and avoid paying the price of paralysis in the process. The challenges Big Data pose for managers include "identifying which data are relevant" Subrata Chakraborty and "seeing through the woods to know what to use and what not" Pieter J de Beer. Scott Waller expressed the fear that "the age of Big Data seems to be arriving at the time of death for the Big Thinker." Gerald Nanninga cautioned us that "the big risk is that it gives executives a false sense of comfort." Clifford Francis Baker added, "My concern is primarily focused on the possibility of complacency … data derived from data analytics must … be handled with care." Mok Tuck Sung commented that "technology and knowledge advancement have again developed faster than the managers' and business owners' capabilities to leverage its usefulness in their decision making process." Philippe Gouamba reminded us that "perfection is but an illusion … A successful outcome is almost never the result of perfect information." Among the suggestions for managers were these: Help "data analyzers consume and translate the data" Scott Kemme, who also suggested an alternative title for the column, which I instead used above, Know "what not to look at." Phillip Clark Work to reduce turnover among business analysts who "tend to be lower level employees and have a high turnover," creating a "losing battle" through the loss of "institutional data knowledge." Kim Kraemer Avoid the belief that "whatever is new will solve their problems," concentrating on the appropriate application of Big Data. Seena Sharp Avoid allowing Big Data to remain the "purview of the select few" only for use for one-off and one-time decisions." Jonathan Spier Maintain the attitude that "fast is better than perfect." Mike Flanagan Avoid the temptation of harvesting just the "'low hanging fruit' rather than waiting for the analysts to gain understanding presumably of the decisions to be made." Sean O'Riordain Rather than concentrating on the data, focus on "being able to formulate the right questions to ask at precisely the right moment." Edward Hare That's quite a list. Tom Dolembo drew a picture of direct process control in which decisions have to be made "in the flow" in situations where there isn't time for conventional analysis at least by humans. Is this a glimpse into the future of decision-making without analysis paralysis based on big data for a widening range of decisions or is it confined to a special set of conditions Will access to Big Data further enable fact-based decision making or … analysis paralysis What do you think Original article Ideas and trends converge from time to time in a way that suggests the possible shape of the future. Sometimes I think I can comprehend what they may mean. But other times I know I need help. This is one of those times. Just two decades ago, we didn't have Google and other information sources; storage constraints would not have permitted Google to provide everyday access to the "world's information." If we had had the information, we couldn't have accessed it effectively anyway. Email systems were not widely available, let alone mobile devices with capacity to access the data. Now the capacity to store and access information through cloud computing is so great that we are entering a post-Google era in which new organizations like Factual founded by a former Google employee have set as their goal that of providing access to all of the world's facts. Presumably this means data such as the location of every factory in the world, data that has not already been massaged and spun. Some facts have to be acquired and organized. Other facts are generated by so-called digital sensors operating worldwide in industrial equipment, autos, and the like. By linking the sensors, an "industrial Internet" can be created. These trends appear to have "opportunity" written all over them, particularly for those who are training now for jobs in data analytics. In addition to less wasteful marketing efforts we should be able to know, for example, "which half" of advertising is effective, thereby making an old marketing saw obsolete, they should produce more effective business strategies and inject added certainty into the appraisal of opportunities for new business startups. Furthermore, analytics not the data should be a source of continuing competitive advantage. In his new book, Charles Duhigg describes how the retailer Target uses data on consumption patterns to discern and address promotions to pregnant customers, perhaps even before they've announced their pregnancy to friends and Target competitors. This is particularly important because pregnancy is one of those life events associated with significant shifts in consumption habits. A problem is that the shortage of experts in data analytics some call them "data whisperers" is so acute that it may be years before a sufficient supply can be trained. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that up to 190,000 are needed now in the US, along with 1.5 million managers capable of using their work. The shortage appears to be growing along with the potential for competitive advantage associated with data analytics. This all raises many questions. Will the age of big data eliminate most or all uncertainty from business decisions for those most able to make effective use of "all the facts in the world" Will it fuel the next "gold rush" for talent in a quest for competitive advantage Will analytics, as well as the supply of analytics-savvy managers, so badly lag "big data" that it will only lead to confusion and misguided decisions Or is this just the latest management fad How, if at all, should this affect education for management What do you think To read more: </text>

In this excerpt, they discuss how corporate managers should consider the interaction of open source and proprietary on software they develop and use. Implications for Corporate Managers Be sensitive to the lack of a ''right'' answer. There is no reason to expect different firms to make the same choices in terms of open source and proprietary software. There is no simple ranking of open source and proprietary software, either in terms of the full costs of adoption or the quality of the software. The basic reason is that open source and commercial software pose different trade-offs in terms of costs and quality, and companies are heterogeneous. These users do not all attach the same weights to the different dimensions of cost and quality. Moreover the trade-offs regarding the various dimensions of cost and quality, and the weights that users attach to them, are likely to depend on the particular task for which software is needed, so the same user could make different choices about which software to use. The appropriate mixture between open and proprietary software will vary with the company's circumstances. When considering the costs and benefits of open source and proprietary software, approach the received wisdom with caution. Our survey of firms regarding the costs of different types of software suggests that some of the commonly accepted patterns about the differences in costs and benefits between these two types of software do not hold. For instance, the relative differences in the cost components are not as sharply different as we would have assumed. Therefore it is important to do a precise analysis adapted to each specific case. The appropriate mixture between open and proprietary software will vary with the company's circumstances. Our survey suggested a number of patterns that drive firms to engage in open source development. For instance, not surprisingly, larger firms were much more likely to engage in some open source activity than either small- or medium-sized companies but less likely to specialize in open source. Similarly companies that work on customized software, bundled software, and to a lesser extent support services are significantly more likely to engage in some open source than pure software developers. Synergies are likely to make it more attractive to combine open source with some business models than others. The appropriate mixture between open and proprietary software will vary with the stage of development of the nation in which the company is based. Our survey showed that the relative importance of the initial cost of the software and what we term complementary costs—those involving the costs of switching, assuring interoperability, support and upgrades—vary with the level of national economic development. We find that the initial cost of software is relatively more important in less wealthy countries than in middle-income countries, and at the same time more important in middle-income than in high-income countries. Meanwhile the complementary costs grow in importance in wealthier nations. Remember not to confuse vertical and horizontal differentiation. As we highlighted in chapter 5, there are really two kinds of quality differences: vertical differentiation, where one product clearly dominates the other the BMW vs. the Yugo, in our example and horizontal differentiation, where different consumers with different needs would choose different options the Yugo and the pickup truck. The vast majority of instances in software involve horizontal differences, where different customers will make different choices. As a result coexistence between open source and proprietary software is the rule rather than the exception. Managers must make choices with a keen eye to their target audience and awareness that no one product is unlikely to satisfy all users. Mixing is the rule, not the exception. We observe that users extensively mix the two types of software, and that this pattern held in all the countries we studied. Moreover the extent to which open source is used and the degree of mixing between open source and proprietary software both depend on user characteristics, in ways that are consistent with economic principles. Companies should see the use of open source and proprietary software not as an either-or decision, as it is so often depicted in the literature, but as a continuum.
